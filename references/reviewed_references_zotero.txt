AB  - INTRODUCTION: Drug safety researchers seek to know the degree of certainty with which a particular drug is associated with an adverse drug reaction. There are different sources of information used in pharmacovigilance to identify, evaluate, and disseminate medical product safety evidence including spontaneous reports, published peer-reviewed literature, and product labels. Automated data processing and classification using these evidence sources can greatly reduce the manual curation currently required to develop reference sets of positive and negative controls (i.e. drugs that cause adverse drug events and those that do not) to be used in drug safety research. METHODS: In this paper we explore a method for automatically aggregating disparate sources of information together into a single repository, developing a predictive model to classify drug-adverse event relationships, and applying those predictions to a real world problem of identifying negative controls for statistical method calibration. RESULTS: Our results showed high predictive accuracy for the models combining all available evidence, with an area under the receiver-operator curve of ⩾0.92 when tested on three manually generated lists of drugs and conditions that are known to either have or not have an association with an adverse drug event. CONCLUSIONS: Results from a pilot implementation of the method suggests that it is feasible to develop a scalable alternative to the time-and-resource-intensive, manual curation exercise previously applied to develop reference sets of positive and negative controls to be used in drug safety research.

AB  - Background and Aim: Recent evidence has concerned acute kidney injury (AKI) after the proton pump inhibitor (PPI) application. There are few real-world studies to compare the occurrences, clinical features, and prognosis of AKI related to various PPI regimens. We aimed to evaluate and compare the links between different PPIs and AKI in a large population by investigating the Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) until recently. Methods: Disproportionality analysis and Bayesian analysis were used in data mining to screen the suspected AKI after different PPIs based on the FAERS from January 2004 to December 2019. The times to onset, fatality, and hospitalization rates of PPI-associated AKI were also investigated. Results: We identified 19 522 PPI-associated AKIs, which appeared to influence more middle-aged patients than elderly ones (53.04% vs 33.94%). Women were more affected than men (55.42% vs 44.58%). Lansoprazole appeared a stronger AKI association than other PPIs, based on the highest reporting odds ratio (reporting odds ratio = 20.8, 95% confidence interval = 20.16, 21.46), proportional reporting ratio (proportional reporting ratio = 15.55, χ2 = 73 899.68), and empirical Bayes geometric mean (empirical Bayes geometric mean = 15.15, 95% confidence interval = 14.76). The median time to AKI onset was 446 (interquartile range [IQR] 16–2176) days after PPI administration. PPIs showed a significant difference in average time to AKI onset (P < 0.001), with the shortest of 9 (IQR 3–25) days for rabeprazole and the longest of 1221 (IQR 96.5–2620) days for esomeprazole. PPI-associated AKI generally led to a 5.69% fatality rate and an 8.94% hospitalization rate. The highest death rate occurred in rabeprazole (15.35%). Conclusions: Based on the FAERS database, we profiled AKI related to various PPIs with more details in occurrences, clinical characteristics, and prognosis. Concern should be paid for PPIs when applied to patients with a tendency for AKI.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The US FDA is interested in a tool that would enable pharmacovigilance safety evaluators to automate the identification of adverse drug events (ADEs) mentioned in FDA prescribing information. The MITRE Corporation (MITRE) and the FDA organized a shared task-Adverse Drug Event Evaluation (ADE Eval)-to determine whether the performance of algorithms currently used for natural language processing (NLP) might be good enough for real-world use. OBJECTIVE: ADE Eval was conducted to evaluate a range of NLP techniques for identifying ADEs mentioned in publicly available FDA-approved drug labels (package inserts). It was designed specifically to reflect pharmacovigilance practices within the FDA and model possible pharmacovigilance use cases. METHODS: Pharmacovigilance-specific annotation guidelines and annotated corpora were created. Two metrics modeled the experiences of FDA safety evaluators: one measured the ability of an algorithm to identify correct Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA(®)) terms for the text from the annotated corpora, and the other assessed the quality of evidence extracted from the corpora to support the selected MedDRA(®) term by measuring the portion of annotated text an algorithm correctly identified. A third metric assessed the cost of correcting system output for subsequent training (averaged, weighted F1-measure for mention finding). RESULTS: In total, 13 teams submitted 23 runs: the top MedDRA(®) coding F1-measure was 0.79, the top quality score was 0.96, and the top mention-finding F1-measure was 0.89. CONCLUSION: While NLP techniques do not perform at levels that would allow them to be used without intervention, it is now worthwhile exploring making NLP outputs available in human pharmacovigilance workflows.

AB  - Adverse drug reaction (ADR) detection is an important issue in drug safety. ADRs are health threats caused by medication. Identifying ADRs in a timely manner can reduce harm to patients and can also assist doctors in the rational use of drugs. Many studies have investigated potential ADRs based on social media due to the openness and timeliness of this resource; however, they have ignored the fine-grained emotional expression in social media text. In addition, the benchmark datasets from social media are usually small, which can result in the problem of over-fitting. In this paper, we propose the Adversarial Neural Network with Sentiment-aware Attention (ANNSA) model, which enhances the sentimental element in social media and improves the performance of neural networks via data augmentation. Specifically, a sentiment-aware attention mechanism is proposed to extract the word-level sentiment features associated with sentiment words and learn task-related information by optimizing a task-specific loss. For low-resource datasets, we use an adversarial training approach to generate perturbations of the word embeddings via an implicit regularization technique. ANNSA was tested on three social media ADR detection datasets, namely, Twitter, TwiMed (Twitter) and CADEC. The experimental results indicated the ability to achieve F1 values of 48.84%, 64.18% and 83.06%, respectively, comparable to the best results reported for state-of-the-art methods. Our study demonstrates that sentiment words are highly correlated with ADRs and that word-level sentiment features can assist in detecting ADRs from social media datasets.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are among the most frequently used medications in the United States. NSAID use can be limited by adverse drug reactions (ADRs), including hypersensitivity reactions (HSRs). OBJECTIVE: We aimed to use electronic health record data to determine the incidence and predictors of HSRs to prescription NSAIDs. METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study of all adult outpatients in a large health care system prescribed diclofenac, indomethacin, nabumetone, or piroxicam between January 1, 2004, and September 30, 2012. The primary outcome was an ADR or HSR attributed to the prescribed NSAID within 1 year of prescription, determined from a longitudinal allergy database. We used natural language processing to classify known ADRs as either HSRs or side effects. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to identify independent risk factors for NSAID HSRs. RESULTS: Of 62,719 patients prescribed NSAIDs, 1,035 (1.7%) had an ADR, of which 189 (18.3%) were HSRs. Multivariable regression analysis identified that patients with prior drug HSR history (odds ratio [OR] 1.8 [95% CI 1.3, 2.5]), female sex (OR 1.8 [95% CI 1.3, 2.4]), autoimmune disease (OR 1.7 [95% CI 1.1, 2.7]), and those prescribed the maximum standing NSAID dose (OR 1.5 [95% CI 1.1, 2.0]) had increased odds of NSAID HSR. CONCLUSIONS: NSAID therapeutic use can be limited by ADRs; about 1 in 5 NSAID ADRs is an HSR. Both patient and drug factors contribute to HSR risk and are important to guide patient counseling.

AB  - Large collections of electronic patient records provide abundant but under-explored information on the real-world use of medicines. Although they are maintained for patient administration, they provide a broad range of clinical information for data analysis. One growing interest is drug safety signal detection from these longitudinal observational data. In this paper, we proposed two novel algorithms-a likelihood ratio model and a Bayesian network model-for adverse drug effect discovery. Although the performance of these two algorithms is comparable to the state-of-the-art algorithm, Bayesian confidence propagation neural network, the combination of three works better due to their diversity in solutions. Since the actual adverse drug effects on a given dataset cannot be absolutely determined, we make use of the simulated observational medical outcomes partnership (OMOP) dataset constructed with the predefined adverse drug effects to evaluate our methods. Experimental results show the usefulness of the proposed pattern discovery method on the simulated OMOP dataset by improving the standard baseline algorithm-chi-square-by 23.83%.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Automatic extraction of adverse drug effect (ADE) mentions from biomedical texts is a challenging research problem that has attracted significant attention from the pharmacovigilance and biomedical text mining communities. Indeed, deep learning based methods have recently been employed to solve this issue with great success. However, they fail to effectively identify the boundary of mentions. In this paper, we propose a weighted online recurrent extreme learning machine (WOR-ELM) based method to overcome this drawback. METHODS: The proposed method for ADE mentions extraction from biomedical texts is divided into two stages: span detection and ADE mentions classification. At the first stage, we identify the boundary of the mentions irrespective of their types with a WOR-ELM in a given sentence. At the second stage, another WOR-ELM is used to classify the identified mentions to the appropriate type. Both stages use the concatenation of character-level and word-level embeddings as features. The character-level embedding is obtained using a modified online recurrent extreme learning machine, whereas the word-level embedding is obtained from a pre-trained model. RESULTS: Several experiments were carried out on a well-known ADE corpus to evaluate the effectiveness and demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed method. The obtained results show that our method achieves an F-score of 87.5%, which outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods. CONCLUSIONS: Our research results indicate that the proposed method for adverse drug effect mentions extraction from text can significantly improve performance over existing methods. Our experiments show the effectiveness of incorporating word-level and character level embeddings as features for WOR-ELM. They also illustrate the benefits of using IOU segment to represent ADE mentions.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: An adverse drug event (ADE) refers to an injury resulting from medical intervention related to a drug including harm caused by drugs or from the usage of drugs. Extracting ADEs from clinical records can help physicians associate adverse events to targeted drugs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We proposed a cascading architecture to recognize medical concepts including ADEs, drug names, and entities related to drugs. The architecture includes a preprocessing method and an ensemble of conditional random fields (CRFs) and neural network-based models to respectively address the challenges of surrogate string and overlapping annotation boundaries observed in the employed ADEs and medication extraction (ADME) corpus. The effectiveness of applying different pretrained and postprocessed word embeddings for the ADME task was also studied. RESULTS: The empirical results showed that both CRFs and neural network-based models provide promising solution for the ADME task. The neural network-based models particularly outperformed CRFs in concept types involving narrative descriptions. Our best run achieved an overall micro F-score of 0.919 on the employed corpus. Our results also suggested that the Global Vectors for word representation embedding in general domain provides a very strong baseline, which can be further improved by applying the principal component analysis to generate more isotropic vectors. CONCLUSIONS: We have demonstrated that the proposed cascading architecture can handle the problem of overlapped annotations and further improve the overall recall and F-scores because the architecture enables the developed models to exploit more context information and forms an ensemble for creating a stronger recognizer.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Adverse drug event (ADE) detection is a vital step towards effective pharmacovigilance and prevention of future incidents caused by potentially harmful ADEs. The electronic health records (EHRs) of patients in hospitals contain valuable information regarding ADEs and hence are an important source for detecting ADE signals. However, EHR texts tend to be noisy. Yet applying off-the-shelf tools for EHR text preprocessing jeopardizes the subsequent ADE detection performance, which depends on a well tokenized text input. OBJECTIVE: In this paper, we report our experience with the NLP Challenges for Detecting Medication and Adverse Drug Events from Electronic Health Records (MADE1.0), which aims to promote deep innovations on this subject. In particular, we have developed rule-based sentence and word tokenization techniques to deal with the noise in the EHR text. METHODS: We propose a detection methodology by adapting a three-layered, deep learning architecture of (1) recurrent neural network [bi-directional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM)] for character-level word representation to encode the morphological features of the medical terminology, (2) Bi-LSTM for capturing the contextual information of each word within a sentence, and (3) conditional random fields for the final label prediction by also considering the surrounding words. We experiment with different word embedding methods commonly used in word-level classification tasks and demonstrate the impact of an integrated usage of both domain-specific and general-purpose pre-trained word embedding for detecting ADEs from EHRs. RESULTS: Our system was ranked first for the named entity recognition task in the MADE1.0 challenge, with a micro-averaged F1-score of 0.8290 (official score). CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that the integration of two widely used sequence labeling techniques that complement each other along with dual-level embedding (character level and word level) to represent words in the input layer results in a deep learning architecture that achieves excellent information extraction accuracy for EHR notes.

AB  - Social media and health-related forums, including the expression of customer reviews, have recently provided data sources for adverse drug reaction (ADR) identification research. However, in the existing methods, the neglect of noise data and the need for manually labeled data reduce the accuracy of the prediction results and greatly increase manual labor. We propose a novel architecture named the weakly supervised mechanism (WSM) convolutional neural network (CNN) long-short-term memory (WSM-CNN-LSTM), which combines the strength of CNN and bi-directional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM). The WSM applies the weakly labeled data to pre-train the parameters of the model and then uses the labeled data to fine-tune the initialized network parameters. The CNN employs a convolutional layer to study the characteristics of the drug reviews and active features at different scales, and then the feed-forward and feed-back neural networks of the Bi-LSTM utilize these salient features to output the regression results. The experimental results effectively demonstrate that our model marginally outperforms the comparison models in ADR identification and that a small quantity of labeled samples results in an optimal performance, which decreases the influence of noise and reduces the manual data-labeling requirements.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The study of adverse drug events (ADEs) is a tenured topic in medical literature. In recent years, increasing numbers of scientific articles and health-related social media posts have been generated and shared daily, albeit with very limited use for ADE study and with little known about the content with respect to ADEs. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to develop a big data analytics strategy that mines the content of scientific articles and health-related Web-based social media to detect and identify ADEs. METHODS: We analyzed the following two data sources: (1) biomedical articles and (2) health-related social media blog posts. We developed an intelligent and scalable text mining solution on big data infrastructures composed of Apache Spark, natural language processing, and machine learning. This was combined with an Elasticsearch No-SQL distributed database to explore and visualize ADEs. RESULTS: The accuracy, precision, recall, and area under receiver operating characteristic of the system were 92.7%, 93.6%, 93.0%, and 0.905, respectively, and showed better results in comparison with traditional approaches in the literature. This work not only detected and classified ADE sentences from big data biomedical literature but also scientifically visualized ADE interactions. CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to investigate a big data machine learning strategy for ADE discovery on massive datasets downloaded from PubMed Central and social media. This contribution illustrates possible capacities in big data biomedical text analysis using advanced computational methods with real-time update from new data published on a daily basis.

AB  - Adverse drug events (ADEs) are common, costly and one of the most important issues in contemporary pharmacotherapy. Current drug safety surveillance methods are largely based on spontaneous reports. However, this is known to be rather ineffective. There is a lack of automated systems checking potential ADEs on routine data captured in electronic health records (EHRs); present systems are usually built directly on top of specific clinical information systems through proprietary interfaces. In the context of the European project "SALUS", we aim to provide an infrastructure as well as a tool-set for accessing and analyzing clinical patient data of heterogeneous clinical information systems utilizing standard methods. This paper focuses on two components of the SALUS architecture: The "Semantic Interoperability Layer" (SIL) enables an access to disparate EHR sources in order to provide the patient data in a common data model for ADE detection within the "ADE Detection and Notification Tool" (ANT). The SIL in combination with the ANT can be used in different clinical environments to increase ADE detection and reporting rates. Thus, our approach promises a profound impact in the domain of pharmacovigilance.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Identification of drugs, associated medication entities, and interactions among them are crucial to prevent unwanted effects of drug therapy, known as adverse drug events. This article describes our participation to the n2c2 shared-task in extracting relations between medication-related entities in electronic health records. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We proposed an ensemble approach for relation extraction and classification between drugs and medication-related entities. We incorporated state-of-the-art named-entity recognition (NER) models based on bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) networks and conditional random fields (CRF) for end-to-end extraction. We additionally developed separate models for intra- and inter-sentence relation extraction and combined them using an ensemble method. The intra-sentence models rely on bidirectional long short-term memory networks and attention mechanisms and are able to capture dependencies between multiple related pairs in the same sentence. For the inter-sentence relations, we adopted a neural architecture that utilizes the Transformer network to improve performance in longer sequences. RESULTS: Our team ranked third with a micro-averaged F1 score of 94.72% and 87.65% for relation and end-to-end relation extraction, respectively (Tracks 2 and 3). Our ensemble effectively takes advantages from our proposed models. Analysis of the reported results indicated that our proposed approach is more generalizable than the top-performing system, which employs additional training data- and corpus-driven processing techniques. CONCLUSIONS: We proposed a relation extraction system to identify relations between drugs and medication-related entities. The proposed approach is independent of external syntactic tools. Analysis showed that by using latent Drug-Drug interactions we were able to significantly improve the performance of non-Drug-Drug pairs in EHRs.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE: Adverse drug events (ADEs) occur in approximately 2-5% of hospitalized patients, often resulting in poor outcomes or even death. Extraction of ADEs from clinical narratives can accelerate and automate pharmacovigilance. Using state-of-the-art deep-learning neural networks to jointly model concept and relation extraction, we achieved the highest integrated task score in the 2018 Medication and Adverse Drug Event (MADE) 1.0 challenge. METHODS: We used a combined bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) and conditional random fields (CRF) neural network to detect medical entities relevant to ADEs and a combined BiLSTM and attention network to determine relations, including the adverse drug reaction relation between medication and sign or symptom entities. Using these models, we conducted three experiments: (1) separate and sequential modeling of entities and relations; (2) joint modeling where relations between medications and sign or symptoms determined ADE and indication entities; (3) use of information from external resources such as the US FDA's adverse event database as additional input to the second method. RESULTS: Joint modeling improved the overall task accuracy from 0.62 to 0.65 F measure, and the additional use of external resources improved the accuracy to 0.66 F measure. Given the gold-standard medical entity labels, the joint model plus external resources method achieved F measures of 0.83 for ADE-relevant medical entity detection and 0.87 for relation detection. CONCLUSION: It is important to use joint modeling techniques and external resources for effectively detecting ADEs from clinical narratives in electronic health record (EHR) systems. While the extraction of entities and relations individually achieved high accuracy, the integrated task still has room for further improvement.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Health-related studies have been recently at the heart attention of the media. Social media, such as Twitter, has become a valuable online tool to describe the early detection of various adverse drug reactions (ADRs). Different medications have adverse effects on various cells and tissues, sometimes more than one cell population would be adversely affected. These types of side effect are occasionally associated with the direct or indirect influence of prescribed drugs but do not have general unfavorable mutagenic consequences on patients. This study aimed to demonstrate a quick and accurate method to collect and classify information based on the distribution of approved data on Twitter. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this classification method, we selected "ask a patient" dataset and combination of Twitter "Ask a Patient" datasets that comprised of 6,623, 26,934, and 11,623 reviews. We used deep learning methods with the word2vec to classify ADR comments posted by the users and present an architecture by HAN, FastText, and CNN. RESULTS: Natural language processing (NLP) deep learning is able to address more advanced peculiarity in learning information compared to other types of machine learning. Moreover, the current study highlighted the advantage of incorporating various semantic features, including topics and concepts. CONCLUSION: Our approach predicts drug safety with the accuracy of 93% (the combination of Twitter and "Ask a Patient" datasets) in a binary manner. Despite the apparent benefit of various conventional classifiers, deep learningbased text classification methods seem to be precise and influential tools to detect ADR.

TI  - Adverse drug reaction detection on social media with deep linguistic features
AU  - Zhang, Y.

PD  - 
AB  - Adverse reactions caused by drugs are one of the most important public health problems. Social media has encouraged more patients to share their drug use experiences and has become a major source for the detection of professionally unreported adverse drug reactions (ADRs). Since a large number of user posts do not mention any ADR, accurate detection of the presence of ADRs in each user post is necessary before further research can be conducted. Previous feature-based methods focus on extracting more shallow linguistic features that are unable to capture deep and subtle information in the context, ultimately failing to provide satisfactory accuracy. To overcome the limitations of previous studies, this paper proposes a novel method that can extract deep linguistic features and then combine them with shallow linguistic features for ADR detection. We first extract predicate-ADR pairs under the guidance of extended syntactic dependencies and ADR lexicon. Then, we extract semantic and part-of-speech (POS) features for each pair and pool the features of different pairs to generate a holistic representation of deep linguistic features. Finally, we use the collection of deep features and several shallow features to train the predictive models. A series of experiments are performed on data sets collected from DailyStrength and Twitter. Our approach can achieve AUCs of 94.44% and 88.97% on the two data sets, respectively, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods. The results demonstrate the potential benefits of deep linguistic features for ADR detection on social data. This method can be applied to multiple other healthcare and text analysis tasks and can be used to support pharmacovigilance research.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The adverse reactions that are caused by drugs are potentially life-threatening problems. Comprehensive knowledge of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) can reduce their detrimental impacts on patients. Detecting ADRs through clinical trials takes a large number of experiments and a long period of time. With the growing amount of unstructured textual data, such as biomedical literature and electronic records, detecting ADRs in the available unstructured data has important implications for ADR research. Most of the neural network-based methods typically focus on the simple semantic information of sentence sequences; however, the relationship of the two entities depends on more complex semantic information. METHODS: In this paper, we propose multihop self-attention mechanism (MSAM) model that aims to learn the multi-aspect semantic information for the ADR detection task. first, the contextual information of the sentence is captured by using the bidirectional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) model. Then, via applying the multiple steps of an attention mechanism, multiple semantic representations of a sentence are generated. Each attention step obtains a different attention distribution focusing on the different segments of the sentence. Meanwhile, our model locates and enhances various keywords from the multiple representations of a sentence. RESULTS: Our model was evaluated by using two ADR corpora. It is shown that the method has a stable generalization ability. Via extensive experiments, our model achieved F-measure of 0.853, 0.799 and 0.851 for ADR detection for TwiMed-PubMed, TwiMed-Twitter, and ADE, respectively. The experimental results showed that our model significantly outperforms other compared models for ADR detection. CONCLUSIONS: In this paper, we propose a modification of multihop self-attention mechanism (MSAM) model for an ADR detection task. The proposed method significantly improved the learning of the complex semantic information of sentences.

AB  - Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are detrimental and unexpected clinical incidents caused by drug intake. The increasing availability of massive quantities of longitudinal event data such as electronic health records (EHRs) has redefined ADR discovery as a big data analytics problem, where data-hungry deep neural networks are especially suitable because of the abundance of the data. To this end, we introduce neural self-controlled case series (NSCCS), a deep learning framework for ADR discovery from EHRs. NSCCS rigorously follows a self-controlled case series design to adjust implicitly and efficiently for individual heterogeneity. In this way, NSCCS is robust to time-invariant confounding issues and thus more capable of identifying associations that reflect the underlying mechanism between various types of drugs and adverse conditions. We apply NSCCS to a large-scale, real-world EHR dataset and empirically demonstrate its superior performance with comprehensive experiments on a benchmark ADR discovery task.

AB  - PURPOSE: To assess the nature, severity, predictability and preventability of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) and to identify risk factors for antiretroviral ADRs. METHODS: Enrolled ambulatory patients were intensively monitored for ADRs. Spontaneously reported ADRs by clinicians were also included. Predictability was assessed based on history of previous exposure to the drug or literature incidence of ADRs. Preventability was assessed using Schumock and Thornton criteria and severity was assessed using modified Hartwig and Siegel scale. Bivariate analysis and subsequently multivariate logistic regression were used to identify the risk factors for ADRs. Data from spontaneous reporting was assessed using Bayesian neural network method for possible ADR signals. RESULTS: Monitoring by active surveillance indentified 159 (52.82%) ADRs from 400 patients. One hundred and forty-two (47.17%) reactions were spontaneously reported. Anaemia and vomiting were the most commonly observed ADRs. The ADRs were severe in 10.9% of cases. A total of 88% ADRs were definitely/probably preventable. Use of Zidovudine+Lamivudine with Nevirapine or Efavirenz, CD4 <200 cells/microl, female gender, tuberculosis and illiteracy were observed as risk factors for ADRs by bivariate analysis. Concurrent tuberculosis was the only influential risk factor for development of ADRs identified by multivariate logistic regression. CONCLUSION: Prevalence of ADRs in intensively monitored patients was found to be 39.7%. Tuberculosis in HIV patients is an influential risk factor for occurrence of ADRs. With the increasing access to antiretrovirals in India, ADRs to antiretrovirals require monitoring and reporting.

AB  - The recent emergence of multidrug-resistant pathogens and/or pharmacokinetics-pharmacodynamics considerations may result in off-label use of a certain class of antibacterials, including tigecycline. This study was performed to clarify the safety profile of tigecycline in the user-derived manner and to compare it with the prescribing information provided by the manufacturer. Numerous spontaneous adverse event reports (AERs) submitted to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) were analyzed after a revision of arbitrary drug names and the deletion of duplicated submissions. Standardized official pharmacovigilance tools were used for quantitative detection of signals, i.e., drug-associated adverse events, including the proportional reporting ratio, the reporting odds ratio, the information component given by a Bayesian confidence propagation neural network, and the empirical Bayes geometric mean. Based on 22017956 co-occurrences, i.e., drug-adverse event pairs, found in 1644220 AERs from 2004 to 2009, 248 adverse events were suggested as tigecycline-associated ones. Adverse events with a relatively high frequency included nausea, vomiting, pancreatitis, hepatic failure, hypoglycemia, and increase in levels of alanine aminotransferase, bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, aspartate aminotransferase, and gamma-glutamyltransferase. It is noted that cholestasis, jaundice, an increase in International Normalized Ratio, and Stevens-Johnson syndrome were also, although they were infrequent. The adverse events suggested were in agreement with information provided by the manufacturer, suggesting that off-label use hardly results in unexpected adverse events, presumably due to usage with extreme caution.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The safety profiles of oral fluoropyrimidines were compared with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) using adverse event reports (AERs) submitted to the Adverse Event Reporting System, AERS, of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). METHODS: After a revision of arbitrary drug names and the deletion of duplicated submissions, AERs involving 5-FU and oral fluoropyrimidines were analyzed. Standardized official pharmacovigilance tools were used for the quantitative detection of signals, i.e., drug-associated adverse events, including the proportional reporting ratio, the reporting odds ratio, the information component given by a Bayesian confidence propagation neural network, and the empirical Bayes geometric mean. RESULTS: Based on 22,017,956 co-occurrences, i.e., drug-adverse event pairs, found in 1,644,220 AERs from 2004 to 2009, it was suggested that leukopenia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia were more frequently accompanied by the use of 5-FU than capecitabine, whereas diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and hand-foot syndrome were more frequently associated with capecitabine. The total number of co-occurrences was not large enough to compare tegafur, tegafur-uracil (UFT), tegafur-gimeracil-oteracil potassium (S-1), or doxifluridine to 5-FU. CONCLUSION: The results obtained herein were consistent with clinical observations, suggesting the usefulness of the FDA's AERS database and data mining methods used, but the number of co-occurrences is an important factor in signal detection.

AB  - Background: To describe and analyze the patterns of adverse events associated with dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP-4is) (sitagliptin, saxagliptin, linagliptin, vildagliptin, and alogliptin) from the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) and to highlight areas of safety concerns. Methods: Adverse events spontaneously submitted to the FAERS between 2004 Q1 to 2019 Q2 were included. The online tool OpenVigil 2.1 was used to query the database. The research relied on definitions of preferred terms (PTs) specified by the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) and the standardized MedDRA Queries (SMQ). The reporting odds ratio (ROR), with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) was calculated for disproportionality analysis. Results: Over 16 years, a total of 9706 adverse event reports were identified. Alogliptin was excluded from further analysis due to insufficient sample size. Compared with the non-insulin antidiabetic drugs, the four DPP-4is were all disproportionately associated with four SMQs: "gastrointestinal nonspecific inflammation and dysfunctional conditions,""hypersensitivity,""severe cutaneous adverse reactions,"and "noninfectious diarrhoea". As for PT level analyses, DPP-4is are associated with higher reporting of the gastrointestinal tract, pancreas, malignancies, infection, musculoskeletal disorders, general disorders, hypersensitivity, and skin AEs. Conclusions: Data mining of the FAERS is useful for examining DPP-4 inhibitors-associated adverse events. The findings of the present study are compatible with clinical experience, and it provides valuable information to decision-makers and healthcare providers in clinical practice.

AB  - Purpose: Ifosfamide is extensively used to treat several malignant conditions. Administration of ifosfamide can cause encephalopathy and other neurotoxic effects. The aim of this study was to obtain novel information on the onset profiles of ifosfamide-induced encephalopathy (IIE) considering other associated clinical factors using the US Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) and the Japanese Adverse Drug Event Report (JADER) databases. Methods: We analyzed the reports of encephalopathy between 2004 and 2018 from the FAERS and JADER databases. To define IIE, we used the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) preferred terms and standardized queries. The reporting odds ratios (ROR) at 95% confidence interval (CI) was used to detect the signal for IIE and adjusted for covariates using a multivariate logistic regression technique. We evaluated the time-to-onset profile of IIE and used the association rule mining technique to discover undetected associations, such as potential risk factors. Results: In the FAERS database, the ROR (CI) for encephalopathy (preferred term, PT) and encephalopathy (standardized MedDRA queries, SMQ) was 56.58 (51.69–61.93) and 1.57 (1.48–1.67), respectively. In the JADER database, the ROR (95% CI) for encephalopathy (PT) and encephalopathy (SMQ) was 13.54 (9.91–18.50) and 1.24 (1.01–1.53), respectively. The multivariate logistic regression analysis showed a significant contribution in IIE signal in the ≥ 60 year group (p = 0.00094; vs. < 60 year group) and ≥ 2000 mg/m2 dosage group (p = 0.00045; vs. < 2000 mg/m2 dosage group). The association rules of {ifosfamide, aprepitant} → {encephalopathy (SMQ)} demonstrated high lift values. The average dose of ifosfamide in patients with encephalopathy (PT) and without encephalopathy (PT) was 2022.8 ± 592.8 (mean ± standard deviation) and 1568.5 ± 703.2 mg/m2, respectively (p < 0.05). Encephalopathy within the first 7 days of ifosfamide administration was 94.1% for encephalopathy (PT) and 87.7% for encephalopathy (SMQ), respectively. Conclusions: The present analysis demonstrated that the incidence of encephalopathy with ifosfamide should be closely monitored for a short onset (within 7 days). The patients who are administered a high dose of ifosfamide or co-administrated aprepitant should be carefully monitored for the development of encephalopathy.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Adverse event reports (AERs) submitted to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) were reviewed to confirm platinum agent-associated adverse events, and to clarify the rank-order of these drugs in terms of susceptibility. METHODS: After a revision of arbitrary drug names and the deletion of duplicated submissions, AERs involving cisplatin (CDDP), carboplatin (CBDCA), or oxaliplatin (L-OHP) were analyzed. Authorized pharmacovigilance tools were used for the quantitative detection of signals, i.e., drug-associated adverse events, including the proportional reporting ratio, the reporting odds ratio, the information component given by a Bayesian confidence propagation neural network, and the empirical Bayes geometric mean. RESULTS: Based on 1,644,220 AERs from 2004 to 2009, CDDP, CBDCA, and L-OHP all proved to cause nausea, vomiting, acute renal failure, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and peripheral sensory neuropathy. Higher susceptibility to nausea was found for CDDP than CBDCA and L-OHP. Acute renal failure was also more predominant for CDDP, and CBDCA did not increase the blood level of creatinine. A stronger association with thrombocytopenia was suggested for CBDCA. Susceptibility to peripheral sensory neuropathy was greatest for L-OHP, but less extensive for CDDP and CBDCA. CONCLUSION: The results obtained herein were consistent with clinical observations, suggesting the usefulness of the FDA's adverse event reporting system, AERS, and the data mining method used herein.

AB  - Importance: Sipuleucel-T was the first therapeutic cancer vaccine approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2010. Although almost a decade has passed since its approval for the treatment of asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), there remains a paucity of literature describing safety data in the postmarketing period. Objective: To describe the postmarketing safety experience for sipuleucel-T. Design, Setting, and Participants: In this case series study, US reports for sipuleucel-T submitted to the FDA's Adverse Event Reporting System were searched and reviewed between April 29, 2010, and December 31, 2017. This system is a spontaneous safety surveillance database for drug and therapeutic biologic products. The analysis of 3216 reports and select case reviews were undertaken between February and November 2018. Main Outcomes and Measures: Descriptive statistics were used to assess adverse event reports for sipuleucel-T. Empirical Bayes Geometric Means (EBGM) and their 90% confidence intervals (CIs) were computed to identify disproportionate (ie, at least twice the expected) reporting of sipuleucel-T-event pairs. Selected adverse events and death reports were individually reviewed. Results: In total, 3216 reports were identified for sipuleucel-T, of which 2014 (62.6%) were serious. For all included reports, the patients' median (interquartile range) age was 73 (67-79) years, and 3149 were specified to be males. Chills (n = 318), malaise (n = 196), pyrexia (n = 189), culture positive (n = 184), fatigue (n = 180), and nausea (n = 173) were among the most commonly reported adverse events. Infusion-related reactions (EBGM, 12.1; 90% CI, 9.4-15.3), infections, vascular events, and transient ischemic attacks (EBGM, 2.9; 90% CI, 2.2-3.9) were reported disproportionately. Among 249 deaths for which relevant dates were available, 128 (51.4%) were reported within 30 days of a sipuleucel-T infusion, of which 81.2% included a specified cause of death; of these 104 deaths, there were 37 neoplasms (35.6%), 25 cardiac disorders (24.0%), 18 nervous system disorders (17.3%), and 9 infections (8.7%). Conclusions and Relevance: Reported adverse events were generally consistent with the safety experience observed in prelicensure studies and described in the sipuleucel-T package insert. Off-label use among overtly symptomatic men with CRPC, reporting bias, or lack of product effectiveness may have influenced the reporting of deaths within 30 days of treatment initiation. With this overview of sipuleucel-T experience, the present study serves as a resource for health care professionals and patients as they weigh the risks and benefits of treatment in the context of all available therapeutic options for CRPC.

Although approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1986 (DigiBind) and 2001 (DigiFab), there remains a paucity of literature describing the safety of these products in the postmarketing setting. Objective: We sought to assess US adverse event (AE) reports submitted to the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) for DigiBind and DigiFab in the postmarketing period. Patients and Methods: We searched reports for DigiBind and DigiFab submitted from the time of each product approval through December 31, 2019. Descriptive statistics were used to assess AE reports for DigiBind and DigiFab. Empirical Bayes geometric means (EBGMs) and their 90% confidence intervals were computed to identify disproportionate (i.e., at least twice the expected) reporting of DigiBind and DigiFab. Reports describing selected AEs and death outcomes were individually reviewed. Results: A total of 78 DigiBind and 43 DigiFab reports were identified, of which 68 DigiBind (87.2%) and 27 DigiFab (62.8%) reports were serious. Among the most frequently reported AEs for both products [DigiBind, DigiFab, respectively] were cardiac (bradycardia [3.8%, 3.9%], cardiac arrest [3.3%, 3.9%], and hypotension [2.4%, 2.6%]) and non-cardiac (nausea [1.9%, 2.6%] and hyperkalemia [1.4%, 1.9%]) events. These AEs were labeled events or confounded by indication for use (digoxin toxicity). Nineteen (24.4%) DigiBind and 13 (30.2%) DigiFab reports described an outcome of death, of which seven (53.8%) DigiFab reports were attributed to poisoning with non-digoxin cardiac glycosides. No deaths could be attributed to DigiBind or DigiFab administration. Conclusions: Our analysis did not identify new safety concerns for DigiBind or DigiFab. Most AEs reported were labeled events or confounded by indication for use.

AB  - Background Limited data are available describing the post-licensure safety of meningococcal vaccines, including Menveo®. We reviewed reports of adverse events (AEs) to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) to assess safety in all age groups. Methods VAERS is a national spontaneous vaccine safety surveillance system co-administered by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the US Food and Drug Administration. We searched the VAERS database for US reports of adverse events in persons who received Menveo from 1 January 2010 through 31 December 2015. We clinically reviewed reports and available medical records for serious AEs, selected pre-specified outcomes, and vaccination during pregnancy. We used empirical Bayesian data mining to identify AEs that were disproportionately reported after receipt of Menveo. Results During the study period, VAERS received 2614 US reports after receipt of Menveo. Of these, 67 were classified as serious, including 1 report of death. Adolescents (aged 11–18 years) accounted for 74% of reports. Most of the reported AEs were non-serious and described AEs consistent with data from pre-licensure studies. Anaphylaxis and syncope were the two most common events in the serious reports. We did not identify any new safety concerns after review of AEs that exceeded the data mining threshold, although we did observe disproportionate reporting for terms that were not associated with an adverse event (e.g., “incorrect drug dosage form administered”, “wrong technique in drug usage process”). Although reports were limited, we did not find any evidence for concern regarding the use of Menveo during pregnancy. Conclusions In our review of VAERS reports, findings of AEs were consistent with the data from pre-licensure studies. Vaccine providers should continue to emphasize and adhere to proper administration of the vaccine.

AB  - Background: The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommendations for influenza vaccination of children have expanded from the long-standing recommendation to vaccinate high-risk children aged 6 months, to vaccinating all 6- to 23-month-olds (2004), 2- to 4-year-olds (2006), and 5- to 18-year-olds (2008). Objective: To identify new or unexpected adverse events (AEs) after trivalent inactivated vaccine (TIV) in children. Methods: We analyzed reports after TIV to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System from 1990-2006 in children aged 2 to 17 years, and from the 2008-2009 influenza season in children aged 5 to 17 years. Empiric Bayesian data mining techniques were used to identify new or unexpected AEs during 1990-2006. Results: During 1990-2006, the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System received 2054 reports of children aged 2 to 17 years with a peak in the 2003-2004 influenza season. In 2008-2009, 506 reports describing 5 to 17 year olds were received. The serious reports of tests performed after TIV were approximately 10% of all reports from 2001-2006, and 6% of the reports in the 2008-2009 season. Data mining showed an increased proportion of medication errors and Guillain Barré Syndrome (GBS). The findings of GBS could not be interpreted as causally related to vaccination. Among 201 reports of medication error, 94% had no AE reported other than the medication error itself. Conclusion: In this analysis, we found no unexpected AEs. Our review of medication error and GBS reports suggests that ongoing monitoring in these areas is appropriate. © 2010 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

AB  - Adverse event report (AER) data are a key source of signal for post marketing drug surveillance. The standard methodology to analyze AER data applies disproportionality metrics, which estimate the strength of drug/side-effect associations from discrete counts of their occurrence at report level. However, in other domains, improvements in predictive modeling accuracy have been obtained through representation learning, where discrete features are replaced by distributed representations learned from unlabeled data. This paper describes aer2vec, a novel representational approach for AER data in which concept embeddings emerge from neural networks trained to predict drug/side-effect co-occurrence. Trained models are evaluated for their utility in identifying drug/side-effect relationships, with improvements over disproportionality metrics in most cases. In addition, we evaluate the utility of an otherwise-untapped resource in the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) AER system - reporter designations of suspected causality - and find that incorporating this information enhances performance of all models evaluated.

AB  - Background: Exploration of the Adverse Event Reporting System (AERS) data by a wide scientific community is limited due to several factors. First, AERS data must be intensively preprocessed to be converted into analyzable format. Second, application of the currently accepted disproportional reporting measures results in false positive signals. Methods: We proposed a data mining strategy to improve hypothesis generation with respect to potential associations. Results: By numerous examples, we illustrate that our strategy controls the false positive signals. We implemented a free online tool, AERS spider (www.chemoprofiling.org/AERS). Conclusions: We believe that AERS spider would be a valuable tool for drug safety experts. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - PURPOSE: To study the association between alopecia and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) by estimating reporting rates and by making association comparisons within databases of adverse drug reactions (ADRs). METHODS: All reports of alopecia with marketed SSRIs until the end of 2004 were identified in SWEDIS, the national Swedish database for spontaneously reported ADRs, and in Vigibase, the international ADR database of the World Health Organization. Total SSRI sales volumes in Sweden until the end of 2004 were obtained from the National Corporation of Swedish Pharmacies. The Bayes' Confidence Propagation Neural Network (BCPNN) method was used to estimate associations between alopecia and each of the SSRIs within the two databases. RESULTS: A total of 27 reports of alopecia were identified in SWEDIS. As two reports concerned the use of two SSRIs, there was a total of 29 drug-ADR combinations. All except three reports concerned women (88.9%). The reporting rate of alopecia in Sweden was significantly higher with sertraline compared with citalopram; 20.1 (95%CI 10.7-34.4) reports per million patient-years versus 4.5 (95%CI 1.8-9.3) reports per million patient-years. No significant differences in reporting rates were noted for the remaining SSRIs. Sertraline also showed a statistically significant association with alopecia in both SWEDIS and Vigibase. Citalopram was significantly associated with alopecia in Vigibase, but not in SWEDIS. No statistically significant associations were found for any of the other SSRIs. CONCLUSIONS: Alopecia appears to be a rare ADR to SSRIs. The risk of alopecia seems to vary between the different SSRIs, and might be higher in women than in men.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Electronic Health Records (EHRs)-based surveillance systems are being actively developed for detecting adverse drug reactions (ADRs), but this is being hindered by the difficulty of extracting data from unstructured records. This study performed the analysis of ADRs from nursing notes for drug safety surveillance using the temporal difference method in reinforcement learning (TD learning). METHODS: Nursing notes of 8,316 patients (4,158 ADR and 4,158 non-ADR cases) admitted to Ajou University Hospital were used for the ADR classification task. A TD(λ) model was used to estimate state values for indicating the ADR risk. For the TD learning, each nursing phrase was encoded into one of seven states, and the state values estimated during training were employed for the subsequent testing phase. We applied logistic regression to the state values from the TD(λ) model for the classification task. RESULTS: The overall accuracy of TD-based logistic regression of 0.63 was comparable to that of two machine-learning methods (0.64 for a naïve Bayes classifier and 0.63 for a support vector machine), while it outperformed two deep learning-based methods (0.58 for a text convolutional neural network and 0.61 for a long short-term memory neural network). Most importantly, it was found that the TD-based method can estimate state values according to the context of nursing phrases. CONCLUSIONS: TD learning is a promising approach because it can exploit contextual, time-dependent aspects of the available data and provide an analysis of the severity of ADRs in a fully incremental manner.

AB  - Objective The abundance of text available in social media and health related forums along with the rich expression of public opinion have recently attracted the interest of the public health community to use these sources for pharmacovigilance. Based on the intuition that patients post about Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs) expressing negative sentiments, we investigate the effect of sentiment analysis features in locating ADR mentions. Methods We enrich the feature space of a state-of-the-art ADR identification method with sentiment analysis features. Using a corpus of posts from the DailyStrength forum and tweets annotated for ADR and indication mentions, we evaluate the extent to which sentiment analysis features help in locating ADR mentions and distinguishing them from indication mentions. Results Evaluation results show that sentiment analysis features marginally improve ADR identification in tweets and health related forum posts. Adding sentiment analysis features achieved a statistically significant F-measure increase from 72.14% to 73.22% in the Twitter part of an existing corpus using its original train/test split. Using stratified 10 × 10-fold cross-validation, statistically significant F-measure increases were shown in the DailyStrength part of the corpus, from 79.57% to 80.14%, and in the Twitter part of the corpus, from 66.91% to 69.16%. Moreover, sentiment analysis features are shown to reduce the number of ADRs being recognized as indications. Conclusion This study shows that adding sentiment analysis features can marginally improve the performance of even a state-of-the-art ADR identification method. This improvement can be of use to pharmacovigilance practice, due to the rapidly increasing popularity of social media and health forums.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this study is to analyze the US FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) to identify adverse cardiac events of hydroxychloroquine in older adults. Method: A case/non-case method was used to determine adverse events associated with hydroxychloroquine as the primary suspect drug between January 1, 2004, and December 31, 2019, for older adults (≥65 years). Adverse events are preferred terms (PTs) defined in MedDRA. We used frequentist approaches, including the reporting odds ratio (ROR) and the proportional reporting ratio (PRR) to measure disproportionality. We used Bayesian approaches to derive information component (IC) value and Empirical Bayesian Geometric Mean (EBGM) score. Signals were defined as the number of reports > 3 and the lower limit of 95% confidence intervals (CI) of ROR ≥ 2, PRR ≥ 2, IC > 0, EBGM > 1. Results: We identified 334 adverse cardiac events comprising 71 different MedDRA PTs from 2004 to 2019 for hydroxychloroquine in older adults. Strong disproportionality signals were noted for “Restrictive cardiomyopathy” (ROR = 272.43 (138.09–537.47); EBGM = 149.78 (77.34–264.67), “Right ventricular hypertrophy” (219.49 (85.32–564.70); 102.74 (39.67–222.81), “Cardiac septal hypertrophy” (226.77 (78.65–653.80); 93.82 (32.19–219.81), “Myocardial fibrosis” (57.29 (21.06–155.85); 42.99 (14.74–100.75), and “Cardiotoxicity” (43.90 (26.66–72.27); 40.28 (24.02–63.72). Conclusions: The risk of cardiomyopathy and myocardial disorders is high following exposure to hydroxychloroquine in older adults. Due to the current lack of safety data from randomized controlled trials as well as large observational studies to confirm the risk of adverse cardiac events associated with hydroxychloroquine, findings from analyses of post-marketing data may serve as interim guidance.

AB  - The aim of this study has been to investigate the time-to-onset and onset-pattern of drug-induced interstitial lung disease (DILD) after the administration of monoclonal antibodies through the use of the spontaneous adverse reaction reporting system of the Japanese Adverse Drug Event Report database. DILD datasets for adalimumab, bevacizumab, cetuximab, denosumab, golimumab, infliximab, nivolumab, panitumumab, pembrolizumab, tocilizumab, and trastuzumab were used to calculate the median time-to-onset of DILD, as well as the Weibull distribution parameters. The median time-to-onset of DILD for pembrolizumab and infliximab was within 1 month. The median time-to-onset of DILD for cetuximab, nivolumab, panitumumab, bevacizumab, golimumab, trastuzumab, and tocilizumab ranged from 1 to 2 months. The median time-to-onset of DILD for denosumab and adalimumab was more than 2 months. Infliximab, trastuzumab and tocilizumab, and denosumab were estimated to fit the early failure type profile of the Weibull distribution parameters. Cetuximab, nivolumab, panitumumab, bevacizumab, golimumab, and adalimumab were estimated to fit the random failure type profile. Pembrolizumab was estimated to fit the wear out failure type profile. Cluster analysis was performed to classify the time-to-onset patterns of DILD. Hierarchical cluster analysis showed 3 clusters. The findings of this study established both the most likely time period and onset-pattern of DILD that can occur in patients after the administration of monoclonal antibody agents.

AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the time-to-onset of drug-induced interstitial lung disease (DILD) following the administration of small molecule molecularly-targeted drugs via the use of the spontaneous adverse reaction reporting system of the Japanese Adverse Drug Event Report database. DILD datasets for afatinib, alectinib, bortezomib, crizotinib, dasatinib, erlotinib, everolimus, gefitinib, imatinib, lapatinib, nilotinib, osimertinib, sorafenib, sunitinib, temsirolimus, and tofacitinib were used to calculate the median onset times of DILD and the Weibull distribution parameters, and to perform the hierarchical cluster analysis. The median onset times of DILD for afatinib, bortezomib, crizotinib, erlotinib, gefitinib, and nilotinib were within one month. The median onset times of DILD for dasatinib, everolimus, lapatinib, osimertinib, and temsirolimus ranged from 1 to 2 months. The median onset times of the DILD for alectinib, imatinib, and tofacitinib ranged from 2 to 3 months. The median onset times of the DILD for sunitinib and sorafenib ranged from 8 to 9 months. Weibull distributions for these drugs when using the cluster analysis showed that there were 4 clusters. Cluster 1 described a subgroup with early to later onset DILD and early failure type profiles or a random failure type profile. Cluster 2 exhibited early failure type profiles or a random failure type profile with early onset DILD. Cluster 3 exhibited a random failure type profile or wear out failure type profiles with later onset DILD. Cluster 4 exhibited an early failure type profile or a random failure type profile with the latest onset DILD.

AB  - WHAT IS KNOWN AND OBJECTIVE: Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors (ALK TKIs) are standard first-line therapy for non-small cell lung cancer patients with ALK rearrangement. Although some cases of hepatotoxicity related to these drugs have been reported, there is still a lack of investigation on severe hepatotoxicity, such as hepatic failure, with ALK TKIs. METHODS: We evaluated ALK TKI (crizotinib, alectinib, brigatinib, ceritinib and lorlatinib)-induced hepatic failure events (AIHFEs), by using the Reporting Odds Ratio (ROR) and Bayesian Confidence Propagation Neural Network method for mining the adverse event report signals in the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database from Jan 2013 to Dec 2019. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The AIHFEs of "Hepatic failure," "hepatitis fulminant" and "hepatic necrosis" were defined as exposure event signals caused by ALK TKIs. The RORs of "Hepatic failure" were 4.95 (2.36-10.42) in alectinib, 3.77 (1.69-8.40) in ceritinib and 2.45 (1.60-3.76) in crizotinib, respectively. The ROR of "hepatitis fulminant" was 7.86 (3.52-17.54) in crizotinib. The Information Component value of "hepatic necrosis" was 1.97 (0.15) in alectinib. In reports of exposure-event signals, the clinical outcome of eventual death was common and could occur within 3 months. In the reports of "hepatic failure," there was no significant difference in the number of reports between men and women [OR=1.86 (0.94-3.67), p = 0.09]. WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSIONS: By mining the adverse event report signals in the FAERS database, we found the exposure event signals of AIHFEs in ALK TKIs were "hepatic failure," "hepatitis fulminant" and "hepatic necrosis". AIHFEs were more likely to appear in the reports of ceritinib, crizotinib and alectinib.

AB  - OBJECTIVE It has been suggested that there is a mechanism by which nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may interfere with antidepressant response, and poorer outcomes among NSAID-treated patients were reported in the Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression (STAR*D) study. To attempt to confirm this association in an independent population-based treatment cohort and explore potential confounding variables, the authors examined use of NSAIDs and related medications among 1,528 outpatients in a New England health care system. METHOD Treatment outcomes were classified using a validated machine learning tool applied to electronic medical records. Logistic regression was used to examine the association between medication exposure and treatment outcomes, adjusted for potential confounding variables. To further elucidate confounding and treatment specificity of the observed effects, data from the STAR*D study were reanalyzed. RESULTS NSAID exposure was associated with a greater likelihood of depression classified as treatment resistant compared with depression classified as responsive to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (odds ratio=1.55, 95% CI=1.21-2.00). This association was apparent in the NSAIDs-only group but not in those using other agents with NSAID-like mechanisms (cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors and salicylates). Inclusion of age, sex, ethnicity, and measures of comorbidity and health care utilization in regression models indicated confounding; association with outcome was no longer significant in fully adjusted models. Reanalysis of STAR*D results likewise identified an association in NSAIDs but not NSAID-like drugs, with more modest effects persisting after adjustment for potential confounding variables. CONCLUSIONS These results support an association between NSAID use and poorer antidepressant outcomes in major depressive disorder but indicate that some of the observed effect may be a result of confounding.

TI  - Antidepressants that inhibit neuronal norepinephrine reuptake are not associated with increased spontaneous reporting of cardiomyopathy

AB  - A recent literature review linked norepinephrinergic stimulation to alterations in cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-mediated signaling in cardiac myocytes and suggested that this might contribute to the pathological mechanisms that lead to chamber enlargement and hypocontractility, which are seen in dilated cardiomyopathy. This accompanies a large body of literature linking cardiac sympathetic outflow activation in early heart failure with progressive myocyte deterioration. As the mode of action of a number of antidepressants involves the inhibition of neuronal norepinephrine reuptake to varying degrees, this study was conducted to assess whether such agents might be associated with disproportionate reporting of cardiomyopathy. Limited data exist specifically examining the association between the antidepressant use and the cardiomyopathy. Using a data mining algorithm (DMA), we quantitatively investigated the association between antidepressant agents that predominantly exert their effects through inhibiting neuronal norepinephrine reuptake (rather than serotonin) and cardiomyopathy. We retrospectively applied a Bayesian DMA, the Bayesian Confidence Propagation Neural Network, to the cumulative reports in the Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (through the fourth quarter of 2006) and World Health Organization Vigibase (through the second quarter of 2007) databases. A threshold of the posterior interval 95% lower limit > 0 was used to define a signal of disproportionate reporting with individual or groups of antidepressants and cardiomyopathy-related terms. The analysis suggested that there is no direct relationship between antidepressants with greater norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor activity (affinity for norepinephrine reuptake transporter or selectivity for norepinephrine versus serotonin) and reporting of cardiomyopathy. In contrast, an inverse correlation might exist with a higher number of cases identified with tricyclic antidepressants showing lower norepinephrine reuptake inhibition and the serotonin/norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors as well as with serotonin/ norepinephrine/slight dopamine reuptake inhibitor.

AB  - AIM: To describe spontaneously reported cases of erectile dysfunction (ED) in association with angiotensin II type I blockers (ARB) and other antihypertensive drugs. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: All spontaneously reported cases of ED submitted to the Swedish Medical Products Agency (MPA) between 1990 and 2006, where at least one antihypertensive drug was the suspected agent, were scrutinized. Patient demographics, drug treatment and adverse reactions were recorded. Using the Bayesian Confidence Propagation Neural Network (BCPNN) method, the information component (IC) was calculated. RESULTS: Among a total of 225 reports of ED, 59 involved antihypertensive drugs including ARB (9 cases) as suspected agents. A positive IC value was found indicating that ED was reported more often in association with antihypertensive drugs classes, except for angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, compared with all other drugs in the database. Positive dechallenge was reported in 43 cases (72%). DISCUSSION: All classes of major antihypertensive drugs including ARB were implicated as suspected agents in cases of ED. Few risk factors were identified. The relatively high reporting of ED in association with ARB is in contrast with previous studies, suggesting that ARB have neither a positive nor any effect on ED. This discrepancy suggests that further studies are warrnted on this potential adverse reaction to ARB.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To examine the relation between antipsychotic drugs and myocarditis and cardiomyopathy. DESIGN: Data mining using bayesian statistics implemented in a neural network architecture. SETTING: International database on adverse drug reactions run by the World Health Organization programme for international drug monitoring. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Reports mentioning antipsychotic drugs, cardiomyopathy, or myocarditis. RESULTS: A strong signal existed for an association between clozapine and cardiomyopathy and myocarditis. An association was also seen with other antipsychotics as a group. The association was based on sufficient cases with adequate documentation and apparent lack of confounding to constitute a signal. Associations between myocarditis or cardiomyopathy and lithium, chlorpromazine, fluphenazine, haloperidol, and risperidone need further investigation. CONCLUSIONS: Some antipsychotic drugs seem to be linked to cardiomyopathy and myocarditis. The study shows the potential of bayesian neural networks in analysing data on drug safety.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The reports submitted to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) from 1997 to 2011 were reviewed to assess serious adverse events induced by the administration of antipsychotics to children. METHODS: Following pre-processing of FAERS data by elimination of duplicated records as well as adjustments to standardize drug names, reports involving haloperidol, olanzapine, quetiapine, clozapine, ziprasidone, risperidone, and aripiprazole were analyzed in children (age 0-12). Signals in the data that signified a drug-associated adverse event were detected via quantitative data mining algorithms. The algorithms applied to this study include the empirical Bayes geometric mean, the reporting odds ratio, the proportional reporting ratio, and the information component of a Bayesian confidence propagation neural network. Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS), QT prolongation, leukopenia, and suicide attempt were focused on as serious adverse events. RESULTS: In regard to NMS, the signal scores for haloperidol and aripiprazole were greater than for other antipsychotics. Significant signals of the QT prolongation adverse event were detected only for ziprasidone and risperidone. With respect to leukopenia, the association with clozapine was noteworthy. In the case of suicide attempt, signals for haloperidol, olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone, and aripiprazole were detected. CONCLUSIONS: It was suggested that there is a level of diversity in the strength of the association between various first- and second-generation antipsychotics with associated serious adverse events, which possibly lead to fatal outcomes. We recommend that research be continued in order to gather a large variety and quantity of related information, and that both available and newly reported data be placed in the context of multiple medical viewpoints in order to lead to improved levels of care.

TI  - Application of an empiric Bayesian data mining algorithm to reports of pancreatitis associated with atypical antipsychotics
AU  - Hauben, M.
PY  - 2004
PD  - 
AB  - Study Objective. To compare the results from one frequently cited data mining algorithm with those from a study, which was published in a peer-reviewed journal, that examined the association of pancreatitis with selected atypical antipsychotics observed by traditional rule-based methods of signal detection. Design. Retrospective pharmacovigilance study. Intervention. The widely studied data mining algorithm known as the Multi-item Gamma Poisson Shrinker (MGPS) was applied to adverse-event reports from the United States Food and Drug Administration's Adverse Event Reporting System database through the first quarter of 2003 for clozapine, olanzapine, and risperidone to determine if a significant signal of pancreatitis would have been generated by this method in advance of their review or the addition of these events to the respective product labels. Measurements and Main Results. Data mining was performed by using nine preferred terms relevant to drug-induced pancreatitis from the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). Results from a previous study on the antipsychotics were reviewed and analyzed. Physicians' Desk References (PDRs) starting from 1994 were manually reviewed to determine the first year that pancreatitis was listed as an adverse event in the product label for each antipsychotic. This information was used as a surrogate marker of the timing of initial signal detection by traditional criteria. Pancreatitis was listed as an adverse event in a PDR for all three atypical antipsychotics. Despite the presence of up to 88 reports/drug-event combination in the Food and Drug Administration's Adverse Event Reporting System database, the MGPS failed to generate a signal of disproportional reporting of pancreatitis associated with the three antipsychotics despite the signaling of these drug-event combinations by traditional rule-based methods, as reflected in product labeling and/or the literature. These discordant findings illustrate key principles in the application of data mining algorithms to drug safety surveillance. Conclusion. The optimal place of data mining algorithms in the pharmacovigilance tool kit remains to be determined, requires consideration of numerous factors that may affect their performance, and is highly situation dependent.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Identification of adverse events and determination of their seriousness ensures timely detection of potential patient safety concerns. Adverse event seriousness is a key factor in defining reporting timelines and is often performed manually by pharmacovigilance experts. The dramatic increase in the volume of safety reports necessitates exploration of scalable solutions that also meet reporting timeline requirements. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to develop an augmented intelligence methodology for automatically identifying adverse event seriousness in spontaneous, solicited, and medical literature safety reports. Deep learning models were evaluated for accuracy and/or the F1 score against a ground truth labeled by pharmacovigilance experts. METHODS: Using a stratified random sample of safety reports received by Celgene, we developed three neural networks for addressing identification of adverse event seriousness: (1) a binary adverse-event level seriousness classifier; (2) a classifier for determining seriousness categorization at the adverse-event level; and (3) an annotator for identifying seriousness criteria terms to provide supporting evidence at the document level. RESULTS: The seriousness classifier achieved an accuracy of 83.0% in post-marketing reports, 92.9% in solicited reports, and 86.3% in medical literature reports. F1 scores for seriousness categorization were 77.7 for death, 78.9 for hospitalization, and 75.5 for important medical events. The seriousness annotator achieved an F1 score of 89.9 in solicited reports, and 75.2 in medical literature reports. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study indicate that a neural network approach can provide an accurate and scalable solution for potentially augmenting pharmacovigilance practitioner determination of adverse event seriousness in spontaneous, solicited, and medical literature reports.

AB  - Purpose: Signal evaluation is considered to be a tedious process owing to the large number of disproportional signals detected. This study aimed to apply a biclustering algorithm in the spontaneous reporting system of China and to obtain the optimal parameters. The biclustering algorithm is expected to improve the efficiency of signal evaluation by identifying similar signal groups. Methods: Information component (IC) was the method used for disproportionality analysis. By using IC thresholds of various strengths (0.05–4.00), the original quantitative data matrix was transformed into 80 different binary data matrices, where each cell contained either a 1 or 0. The biclustering results were obtained using a total of 720 Bimax algorithm parameters (minimal number of columns and rows was 3, 4, or 5). Next, the optimal parameters were determined through the comprehensive evaluation of the rank sum ration. Finally, we examined the biclustering results under the optimal parameters and evaluated the effect of biclustering analysis on adverse drug reaction (ADR) data in China. Results: The optimal strength of the IC threshold was 0.80, and the minimum number of rows and columns was 3. After taxonomic evaluation, we also found that 1836 biclusters (42.8%) contained similar drugs or similar ADRs, which accounted for 72.3% of signals unevaluated. Conclusions: Applying biclustering analysis in spontaneous reporting system could provide support in confirming unrecognized ADRs, identifying rare ADRs, and screening drug-ADR pairs, which need more attention. Biclustering algorithm could improve the efficiency of signal detection and evaluation in China.

AB  - Dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD)-deficient patients might only become aware of their genotype after exposure to dihydropyrimidines, if testing is performed. Case reports to pharmacovigilance databases might only contain phenotypical manifestations of DPD, without information on the genotype. This poses a difficulty in estimating the cases due to DPD. Auto machine learning models were developed to train patterns of phenotypical manifestations of toxicity, which were then used as a surrogate to estimate the number of cases of DPD-related toxicity. Results indicate that between 8,878 (7.0%) and 16,549 (13.1%) patients have a profile similar to DPD deficient status. Results of the analysis of variable importance match the known end-organ damage of DPD-related toxicity, however, accuracies in the range of 90% suggest presence of overfitting, thus, results need to be interpreted carefully. This study shows the potential for use of machine learning in the regulatory context but additional studies are required to better understand regulatory applicability.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The French National Occupational Diseases Surveillance and Prevention Network (RNV3P) is a French network of occupational disease specialists, which collects, in standardised coded reports, all cases where a physician of any specialty, referred a patient to a university occupational disease centre, to establish the relation between the disease observed and occupational exposures, independently of statutory considerations related to compensation. The objective is to compare the relevance of disproportionality measures, widely used in pharmacovigilance, for the detection of potentially new disease × exposure associations in RNV3P database (by analogy with the detection of potentially new health event × drug associations in the spontaneous reporting databases from pharmacovigilance). METHODS: 2001-2009 data from RNV3P are used (81,132 observations leading to 11,627 disease × exposure associations). The structure of RNV3P database is compared with the ones of pharmacovigilance databases. Seven disproportionality metrics are tested and their results, notably in terms of ranking the disease × exposure associations, are compared. RESULTS: RNV3P and pharmacovigilance databases showed similar structure. Frequentist methods (proportional reporting ratio [PRR], reporting odds ratio [ROR]) and a Bayesian one (known as BCPNN for "Bayesian Confidence Propagation Neural Network") show a rather similar behaviour on our data, conversely to other methods (as Poisson). Finally the PRR method was chosen, because more complex methods did not show a greater value with the RNV3P data. Accordingly, a procedure for detecting signals with PRR method, automatic triage for exclusion of associations already known, and then investigating these signals is suggested. CONCLUSION: This procedure may be seen as a first step of hypothesis generation before launching epidemiological and/or experimental studies.

AB  - Adverse drug reaction (ADR) reporting is a major component of drug safety monitoring; its input will, however, only be optimized if systems can manage to deal with its tremendous flow of information, based primarily on unstructured text fields. The aim of this study was to develop an automated system allowing to code ADRs from patient reports. Our system was based on a knowledge base about drugs, enriched by supervised machine learning (ML) models trained on patients reporting data. To train our models, we selected all cases of ADRs reported by patients to a French Pharmacovigilance Centre through a national web-portal between March 2017 and March 2019 (n = 2,058 reports). We tested both conventional ML models and deep-learning models. We performed an external validation using a dataset constituted of a random sample of ADRs reported to the Marseille Pharmacovigilance Centre over the same period (n = 187). Here, we show that regarding area under the curve (AUC) and F-measure, the best model to identify ADRs was gradient boosting trees (LGBM), with an AUC of 0.93 (0.92-0.94) and F-measure of 0.72 (0.68-0.75). This model was run for external validation showing an AUC of 0.91 and a F-measure of 0.58. We evaluated an artificial intelligence pipeline that was found able to learn how to identify correctly ADRs from unstructured data. This result allowed us to start a new study using more data to further improve our performance and offer a tool that is useful in practice to efficiently manage drug safety information.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Adverse event reports (AERs) submitted to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) were reviewed to assess the bleeding complications induced by the administration of antiplatelets and to attempt to determine the rank-order of the association. METHODS: After a deletion of duplicated submissions and the revision of arbitrary drug names, AERs involving warfarin, aspirin, cilostazol, clopidogrel, ethyl icosapentate, limaprost alfadex, sarpogrelate, and ticlopidine were analyzed. Authorized pharmacovigilance tools were used for the quantitative detection of signals, i.e., drug-associated adverse events, including the proportional reporting ratio, the reporting odds ratio, the information component given by a Bayesian confidence propagation neural network, and the empirical Bayes geometric mean. RESULTS: Based on 22,017,956 co-occurrences, i.e., drug-adverse event pairs, found in 1,644,220 AERs from 2004 to 2009, 736 adverse events were listed as warfarin-associated adverse events, and 147 of the 736 were bleeding complications, including haemorrhage and haematoma. Both aspirin and clopidogrel were associated with haemorrhage, but the association was more noteworthy for clopidogrel. As for bleeding complications related to the gastrointestinal system, e.g., melaena and haematochezia, the statistical metrics suggested a stronger association for aspirin than clopidogrel. The total number of co-occurrences was not large enough to compare the association with bleeding complications for the other 5 antiplatelets. CONCLUSIONS: The data strongly suggest the necessity of well-organized clinical studies with respect to antiplatelet-associated bleeding complications.

AB  - AIMS: Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis are viewed as the most severe drug-induced types of cutaneous adverse reactions, with high rates of morbidity and mortality. We aimed to examine carbamazepine- and oxcarbazepine-associated Stevens-Johnson syndrome or toxic epidermal necrolysis, by data mining the US Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS). METHODS: Reports in FAERs were analysed, from the first quarter of 2004 to the last quarter of 2019. Pharmacovigilance tools were employed for the quantitative detection of signals, where a signal represents a drug-associated adverse event, including the reporting odds ratio, proportional reporting ratio, an information component given by a Bayesian confidence propagation neural network, and the empirical Bayes geometric mean. RESULTS: The total number of reports identified as Stevens-Johnson syndrome or toxic epidermal necrolysis associated with carbamazepine or oxcarbazepine included in this study was 1231. FAERS reports associated with carbamazepine were 1048, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (n = 668) and toxic epidermal necrolysis(n = 380). FAERS reports associated with oxcarbazepine were 183, including 142 Stevens-Johnson syndrome and 41 toxic epidermal necrolysis reports. The risk for Stevens-Johnson syndrome is higher than for toxic epidermal necrolysis and carbamazepine is associated with a higher risk than oxcarbazepine. CONCLUSIONS: The results of our study are consistent with clinical observations, suggesting the necessity for further clinical research on Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis associated with carbamazepine or oxcarbazepine.

We aimed to examine fluoroquinolone (ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and moxifloxacin) associated aortic aneurysm or dissection through data mining of the US Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS). METHODS: Reports to the FAERS from 1 January 2004 to 31 December 2016 were analysed. Pharmacovigilance tools were used for quantitative detection of signals that is, drug-associated adverse events, including reporting odds ratio, proportional reporting ratio, information component given by a Bayesian confidence propagation neural network and empirical Bayes geometric mean. Sensitivity analyses that limited the data by gender and adverse event date also showed similar trends. RESULTS: Based on 3721 adverse event reports, all three fluoroquinolones are associated with aortic aneurysm, and levofloxacin is associated with aortic dissection. The risk of aortic aneurysm is higher than the aortic dissection. Oral administration of fluoroquinolones is more likely to produce these adverse events. CONCLUSION: The results obtained herein are consistent with clinical observations, suggesting the necessity for further clinical research on aortic aneurysm and dissection associated with fluoroquinolones.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Taxanes are an essential class of antineoplastic agents used to treat various cancers and are a fundamental cause of hypersensitivity reactions. In addition, other adverse events, such as bone marrow toxicity and peripheral neuropathy, can lead to chemotherapy discontinuation. This study aimed to evaluate the safety of taxanes in the real world. METHODS: Taxane-associated adverse events were identified by the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities Preferred Terms and analyzed and compared by mining the US Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System pharmacovigilance database from January 2004 to December 2019. Reported adverse events, such as hypersensitivity reaction, bone marrow toxicity, and peripheral neuropathy, were analyzed with the following signal detection algorithms: reporting odds ratio (ROR), proportional reporting ratio (PRR), multi-item gamma Poisson shrinker (MGPS), Bayesian confidence propagation neural network (BCPNN), and logistic regression methods. Adverse outcome events and death outcome rates were compared between different taxane groups using Pearson's χ2 test, whereas significance was determined at P < 0.05 with a 95% confidence interval (CI). RESULTS: A total of 966 reports of hypersensitivity reactions, 1109 reports of bone marrow toxicity, and 1374 reports of peripheral neuropathy were analyzed. Compared with paclitaxel and docetaxel, bone marrow toxicity following the use of nab-paclitaxel had the highest ROR of 6.45 (95% two-sided CI, 6.05-6.88), PRR of 5.66, (χ2 = 4342.98), information component of 2.50 (95% one-sided CI = 2.34), and empirical Bayes geometric mean of 5.64 (95% one-sided CI = 5.34). Peripheral neuropathy following the use of nab-paclitaxel showed a higher ROR of 12.78 (95% two-sided CI, 11.55-14.14), PRR of 12.16 (χ2 = 4060.88), information component of 3.59 (95% one-sided CI = 3.25), and empirical Bayes geometric mean of 12.07 (95% one-sided CI = 11.09). CONCLUSIONS: The results showed that bone marrow toxicity and peripheral neuropathy were the major adverse events induced by taxanes. Nab-paclitaxel exhibited the highest potential for taxane-associated adverse events. Further research in the future is warranted to explain taxane-associated adverse effects in real-world circumstances.

AB  - Adverse drug effects (ADEs) are one of the leading causes of death in developed countries and are the main reason for drug recalls from the market, whereas the ADEs that are associated with action on the cardiovascular system are the most dangerous and widespread. The treatment of human diseases often requires the intake of several drugs, which can lead to undesirable drug-drug interactions (DDIs), thus causing an increase in the frequency and severity of ADEs. An evaluation of DDI-induced ADEs is a nontrivial task and requires numerous experimental and clinical studies. Therefore, we developed a computational approach to assess the cardiovascular ADEs of DDIs. This approach is based on the combined analysis of spontaneous reports (SRs) and predicted drug-target interactions to estimate the five cardiovascular ADEs that are induced by DDIs, namely, myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, ventricular tachycardia, cardiac failure, and arterial hypertension. We applied a method based on least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) logistic regression to SRs for the identification of interacting pairs of drugs causing corresponding ADEs, as well as noninteracting pairs of drugs. As a result, five datasets containing, on average, 3100 potentially ADE-causing and non-ADE-causing drug pairs were created. The obtained data, along with information on the interaction of drugs with 1553 human targets predicted by PASS Targets software, were used to create five classification models using the Random Forest method. The average area under the ROC curve of the obtained models, sensitivity, specificity and balanced accuracy were 0.837, 0.764, 0.754 and 0.759, respectively. The predicted drug targets were also used to hypothesize the potential mechanisms of DDI-induced ventricular tachycardia for the top-scoring drug pairs. The created five classification models can be used for the identification of drug combinations that are potentially the most or least dangerous for the cardiovascular system.

AB  - PURPOSE: We aimed to analyze and evaluate the safety signals of ribavirin-interferon combination through data mining of the US Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS), so as to provide reference for the rationale use of these agents in the management of relevant toxicities emerging in patients with novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19). METHODS: Reports to the FAERS from 1 January 2004 to 8 March 2020 were analyzed. The proportion of report ratio (PRR), reporting odds ratio (ROR), and Bayesian confidence interval progressive neural network (BCPNN) method were used to detect the safety signals. RESULTS: A total of 55 safety signals were detected from the top 250 adverse event reactions in 2200 reports, but 19 signals were not included in the drug labels. All the detected adverse event reactions were associated with 13 System Organ Classes (SOC), such as gastrointestinal, blood and lymph, hepatobiliary, endocrine, and various nervous systems. The most frequent adverse events were analyzed, and the results showed that females were more likely to suffer from anemia, vomiting, neutropenia, diarrhea, and insomnia. CONCLUSION: The ADE (adverse drug event) signal detection based on FAERS is helpful to clarify the potential adverse events related to ribavirin-interferon combination for novel coronavirus therapy; clinicians should pay attention to the adverse reactions of gastrointestinal and blood systems, closely monitor the fluctuations of the platelet count, and carry out necessary mental health interventions to avoid serious adverse events.

AB  - Background: Osteoporosis, which is a major public health concern, has been known to reduce health-related quality of life. Some studies have suggested that antipsychotics could perhaps cause osteoporosis by increasing serum prolactin levels. However, the association between antipsychotics and the risk for developing osteoporosis has been controversial. Objective: The present study aimed to assess the association between antipsychotic use and onset of osteoporosis in real-world settings. Methods: A multimethod data-mining approach using different algorithms and databases was used. First, disproportionality analysis was conducted using the US Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database (2004-2017) with reporting odds ratio (ROR) and information component (IC) being used to indicate a signal. Furthermore, a sequence symmetry analysis using data from a large Japanese administrative claims database (2005-2017; JMDC Inc, Japan) was conducted. Short-term intervals (ie, 12, 24, and 36 months) were set to investigate the association between antipsychotic use and onset of osteoporosis using the adjusted sequence ratio (SR) to indicate a signal. Results: No potential association between osteoporosis and all antipsychotics was observed in the FAERS database, except for perphenazine, which exhibited significant signals using both ROR and IC. Moreover, no potential association between osteoporosis and antipsychotics was observed in the JMDC claims database, except for sulpiride and aripiprazole. None of the antipsychotics indicated significant signals using all analyzed items (ROR, IC, and adjusted SR). Conclusion and Relevance: Real-world data show no association between antipsychotic use and the onset of osteoporosis. Further pharmacoepidemiological studies are needed for causality assessment.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The gut-selective nature of vedolizumab has raised questions regarding increased joint pain or arthralgia with its use in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients. As arthralgias are seldom coded and thus difficult to study, few studies have examined the comparative risk of arthralgia between vedolizumab and tumor necrosis factor inhibitor (TNFi). Our objectives were to evaluate the application of natural language processing (NLP) to identify arthralgia in the clinical notes and to compare the risk of arthralgia between vedolizumab and TNFi in IBD. METHODS: We performed a retrospective study using a validated electronic medical record (EMR)-based IBD cohort from 2 large tertiary care centers. The index date was the first date of vedolizumab or TNFi prescription. Baseline covariates were assessed 1 year before the index date; patients were followed 1 year after the index date. The primary outcome was arthralgia, defined using NLP. Using inverse probability of treatment weight to balance the cohorts, we then constructed Cox regression models to calculate the hazard ratio (HR) for arthralgia in the vedolizumab and TNFi groups. RESULTS: We studied 367 IBD patients on vedolizumab and 1218 IBD patients on TNFi. Patients on vedolizumab were older (mean age, 41.2 vs 34.9 years) and had more prevalent use of immunomodulators (52.3% vs 31.9%) than TNFi users. Our data did not observe a significantly increased risk of arthralgia in the vedolizumab group compared with TNFi (HR, 1.20; 95% confidence interval, 0.97-1.49). CONCLUSIONS: In this large observational study, we did not find a significantly increased risk of arthralgia associated with vedolizumab use compared with TNFi.

AB  - Purpose: Some studies have suggested that the use of benzodiazepines in the elderly is associated with an increased risk of dementia. However, this association might be due to confounding by indication and reverse causation. To examine the association between benzodiazepine anxiolytic drug use and the risk of dementia, we conducted data mining of a spontaneous reporting database and a large organized database of prescriptions. Methods: Data from the US Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) from the first quarter of 2004 through the end of 2013 and data from the Canada Vigilance Adverse Reaction Online Database from the first quarter of 1965 through the end of 2013 were used for the analyses. The reporting odds ratio (ROR) and information component (IC) were calculated. In addition, prescription sequence symmetry analysis (PSSA) was performed to identify the risk of dementia after using benzodiazepine anxiolytic drugs over the period of January 2006 to May 2014. Results: Benzodiazepine use was found to be associated with dementia in analyses using the FAERS database (ROR: 1.63, 95% CI: 1.61-1.64; IC: 0.66, 95% CI: 0.65-0.67) and the Canada Vigilance Adverse Reaction Online Database (ROR: 1.88, 95% CI: 1.83-1.94; IC: 0.85, 95% CI: 0.80-0.89). ROR and IC values increased with the duration of action of benzodiazepines. In the PSSA, a significant association was found, with adjusted sequence ratios of 1.24 (1.05–1.45), 1.20 (1.06–1.37), 1.23 (1.11–1.37), 1.34 (1.23–1.47), 1.41 (1.29–1.53), and 1.44 (1.33–1.56) at intervals of 3, 6, 12, 24, 36, and 48 months, respectively. Furthermore, the additional PSSA, in which patients who initiated a new treatment with benzodiazepines and anti-dementia drugs within 12- and 24-month periods were excluded from the analysis, demonstrated significant associations of benzodiazepine use with dementia risk. Conclusion: Multi-methodological approaches using different methods, algorithms, and databases suggest that long-term use of benzodiazepines and long-acting benzodiazepines are strongly associated with an increased risk of dementia.

AB  - The main objective of this study is to conduct a disproportionality analysis of adverse events in the Japan Adverse Event Report (JADER) database and evaluate the risk of the DPP-4 inhibitor induced autoimmune disorder, the secondary objective is risk assessment of sex difference and age difference. The proportional reporting ratio (PRR) of frequency-based statistics and Bayesian estimates of the information components (IC) were calculated as a measure of signal detection. Sex difference and age difference were evaluated using signal score calculated from the PRR and the Chi-square. In patients taking DPP-4 inhibitors, 94 reports of autoimmune disorders were detected with both signals; PRR: 4.09, chi-square: 158.26 and IC: 1.66, 95 % confidence interval: 1.32–2.00). For other antidiabetic drugs, no signals were detected. The signal of males was PRR: 4.53, chi-square: 110.91 and signal score: 6.22, the signal of female was PRR: 3.53, chi-square: 47.65 and signal score: 5.12. About age difference, the signal scores were 6.71 for patients over 60 years and 0.56 for patients under 60 years old. This study suggests that the DPP-4 inhibitors, unlike other antidiabetic drugs, were associated with autoimmune disorders. Signals of the DPP-4 inhibitors induced autoimmune disorders were detected in both male and female, but no sex difference was observed, but age difference was observed. Especially attention should be paid to patients over 60 years old.

AB  - Case reports suggest an association between second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs) and serotonin syndrome (SS). The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) was analyzed to generate hypotheses about how SGAs may interact with pharmacological targets associated with SS. FAERS was integrated with additional sources to link information about adverse events with drugs and targets. Using Proportional Reporting Ratios, we identified signals that were further investigated with the literature to evaluate mechanistic hypotheses formed from the integrated FAERS data. Analysis revealed common pharmacological targets perturbed in both SGA and SS cases, indicating that SGAs may induce SS. The literature also supported 5-HT2A antagonism and 5-HT1A agonism as common mechanisms that may explain the SGA-SS association. Additionally, integrated FAERS data mining and case studies suggest that interactions between SGAs and other serotonergic agents may increase the risk for SS. Computational analysis can provide additional insights into the mechanisms underlying the relationship between SGAs and SS.

AB  - Purpose: In recent years, the potential risk of cancer associated with statin use has been a focus of much interest. However, it remains uncertain whether statin therapy is associated with cancer risk. To examine the association between statin use and the risk of cancer, we conducted data mining using the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) and a large organized database of claims constructed by a database vendor (The Japan Medical Data Center Co., Ltd, Tokyo, Japan [JMDC]). Methods: Relevant reports in the FAERS, which included data from the first quarter of 2004 through the end of 2012, were identified and analyzed. The reporting odds ratio (ROR) was used to detect spontaneous report signals and was calculated using the case/non-case method. Additionally, signals were detected via the information component (IC) using the IC025 metric. Furthermore, event sequence symmetry analysis (ESSA) was applied to identify the risk of cancer following treatment with statins over the period January 2005 to July 2013. Results: In the FAERS database analyses, significant signals for colorectal cancer and pancreatic cancer were found for statins as a class. In the ESSA, significant associations between statin use and colorectal cancer and pancreatic cancer were found, with adjusted sequence ratios (95% confidence intervals) of 1.20 (1.08-1.34) and 1.31 (1.13-1.53), respectively, at an interval of 48 months. Conclusions: Multi-methodological approaches using different algorithms and databases suggest that statin use is associated with an increased risk for colorectal cancer and pancreatic cancer.

AB  - Background: Particular interest has been generated regarding the possible influence of statin use on sleep quality. However, no conclusive evidence exists that a particular statin is more likely to be associated with sleep disturbances versus others. It remains uncertain whether different statins produce different risks for sleep disturbance. Objective: To examine the association between statin use and the risk of sleep disturbances, we conducted data mining using the US Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) and a large organized database of prescriptions constructed by a database vendor (Japan Medical Information Research Institute, Inc. Japan). Methods: Relevant reports in the FAERS were identified and analyzed. Data from the first quarter of 2004 through the end of 2013 were included in this study. The reporting odds ratio (ROR) was used to detect spontaneous report signals, calculated using the case/non-case method. For the ROR, a signal was detected if the lower limit of 95 % two-sided confidence interval (95 % CI) was >1. Additionally, signal detection using the IC was conducted using the IC025 metric, a lower limit of the 95 % CI of the IC, where a signal is detected if the IC025 value exceeds 0. In addition, symmetry analysis was used to identify the risk of insomnia after using statins over the period of January 2006 to August 2013. Results: In the analyses of the FAERS database, significant signals for sleep disturbances including disturbances in initiating and maintaining sleep, sleep disorders NEC, sleeping disorders due to a general medical condition, and parasomnias were found. In the prescription sequence symmetry analysis, a significant association between statin use and hypnotic drug use was found, with adjusted sequence ratios of 1.14 (1.03-1.26), 1.20 (1.11-1.29), and 1.18 (1.11-1.25) at intervals of 91, 182, and 365 days, respectively. Conclusion: Multi-methodological approaches using different algorithms and databases strongly suggest that statin use is associated with an increased risk for sleep disturbances including insomnia. © 2014 Springer International Publishing.

AB  - Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are a main cause of morbidity and mortality in patients. Extracting mentions of ADRs from the health-related text has important applications in biomedical research. Existing work mainly utilizes feature-based pipeline methods or neural network models that use only word embeddings as input features. These methods either require many efforts to design task-specific features or suffer misclassification on those words, which have not been seen before. Therefore, we propose an end-to-end neural sequence labeling model that labels words in an input sequence with ADRs membership tags. In addition to word-level embeddings, we also adopt character-level embeddings and combine them via an embedding-level attention mechanism. Through such an attention mechanism, our model can dynamically determine how much information to utilize from a word- or character-level component. In addition, we use the intermediate output of the model as an auxiliary classifier and combine it with the final output of the model to improve the overall performance. We evaluate different architectures on two ADRs labeling datasets. One is an ADRs-related Twitter corpus that includes many informal vocabularies and irregular grammar, and the other is a biomedical text extracted from PubMed abstracts with many professional terms and technical descriptions. Our model achieves approximate match F1 scores of 0.844 and 0.906 for ADRs identification on the Twitter and PubMed datasets, respectively. It presents the state-of-the-art performance on both the datasets. Our system is completely end-to-end, requires no task-specific feature engineering or hand-crafted features, and thus can be generalized to a wide range of sequence labeling tasks.

AB  - Adverse Drug Events (ADEs) are prevalent, costly, and sometimes preventable. Post-marketing drug surveillance aims to monitor ADEs that occur after a drug is released to market. Reports of such ADEs are aggregated by reporting systems, such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS). In this paper, we consider the topic of how best to represent data derived from reports in FAERS for the purpose of detecting post-marketing surveillance signals, in order to inform regulatory decision making. In our previous work, we developed aer2vec, a method for deriving distributed representations (concept embeddings) of drugs and side effects from ADE reports, establishing the utility of distributional information for pharmacovigilance signal detection. In this paper, we advance this line of research further by evaluating the utility of encoding orthographic and lexical information. We do so by adapting two Natural Language Processing methods, subword embedding and vector retrofitting, which were developed to encode such information into word embeddings. Models were compared for their ability to distinguish between positive and negative examples in a set of manually curated drug/ADE relationships, with both aer2vec enhancements offering advantages in performances over baseline models, and best performance obtained when retrofitting and subword embeddings were applied in concert. In addition, this work demonstrates that models leveraging distributed representations do not require extensive manual preprocessing to perform well on this pharmacovigilance signal detection task, and may even benefit from information that would otherwise be lost during the normalization and standardization process.

AB  - Objectives: Adverse drug events (ADEs) are among the top causes of hospitalization and death. Social media is a promising open data source for the timely detection of potential ADEs. In this paper, we study the problem of detecting signals of ADEs from social media. Methods: Detecting ADEs whose drug and AE may be reported in different posts of a user leads to major concerns regarding the content authenticity and user credibility, which have not been addressed in previous studies. Content authenticity concerns whether a post mentions drugs or adverse events that are actually consumed or experienced by the writer. User credibility indicates the degree to which chronological evidence from a user's sequence of posts should be trusted in the ADE detection. We propose AC-SPASM, a Bayesian model for the authenticity and credibility aware detection of ADEs from social media. The model exploits the interaction between content authenticity, user credibility and ADE signal quality. In particular, we argue that the credibility of a user correlates with the user's consistency in reporting authentic content. Results: We conduct experiments on a real-world Twitter dataset containing 1.2 million posts from 13,178 users. Our benchmark set contains 22 drugs and 8089 AEs. AC-SPASM recognizes authentic posts with F1 – the harmonic mean of precision and recall of 80%, and estimates user credibility with precision@10 = 90% and NDCG@10 – a measure for top-10 ranking quality of 96%. Upon validation against known ADEs, AC-SPASM achieves F1 = 91%, outperforming state-of-the-art baseline models by 32% (p < 0.05). Also, AC-SPASM obtains precision@456 = 73% and NDCG@456 = 94% in detecting and prioritizing unknown potential ADE signals for further investigation. Furthermore, the results show that AC-SPASM is scalable to large datasets. Conclusions: Our study demonstrates that taking into account the content authenticity and user credibility improves the detection of ADEs from social media. Our work generates hypotheses to reduce experts’ guesswork in identifying unknown potential ADEs.

AB  - Purpose: The aim of this study was to develop an automated causality assessment algorithm to identify drug-induced liver injury. Methods: The Roussel Uclaf Causality Assessment Method (RUCAM) is an algorithm for determining the causal association between a drug and liver injury. In collaboration with hepatology experts, definitions were developed for the RUCAM criteria to operationalize an electronic RUCAM (eRUCAM). The eRUCAM was tested in a population of patients taking 14 drugs with a characteristic phenotype for liver injury. Quality assurance for programming specifications involved comparisons between scores generated by the eRUCAM, for probable and highly probable cases, and expert manual RUCAM (n=20). Concordance between eRUCAM and manual RUCAM subscores and total score was tested using the Wilcoxon signed rank test. Results: Causality scores were the same for 6 of 20 patients (30%) by manual and eRUCAM algorithms. Analysis of subscores revealed ≥80% concordance between manual and eRUCAM for five of the seven criteria. In general, the total scores tended to be higher for the eRUCAM compared with the manual RUCAM. Programming issues were identified for criterion 5 'non-drug causes of liver injury' where significant differences existed between manual and eRUCAM scoring (p=0.001). For criterion 5, identical scores occurred in 9 of 20 patients (45%), and manual review identified additional codes, timing criteria, and laboratory results for improving subsequent eRUCAM revisions. Conclusion: The eRUCAM had generally good concordance with manual RUCAM scoring. These preliminary findings suggest that the eRUCAM algorithm is feasible and could have application in clinical practice and drug safety surveillance. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - The aim of the study was to build a proof-of-concept demonstratrating that big data technology could improve drug safety monitoring in a hospital and could help pharmacovigilance professionals to make data-driven targeted hypotheses on adverse drug events (ADEs) due to drug-drug interactions (DDI). We developed a DDI automatic detection system based on treatment data and laboratory tests from the electronic health records stored in the clinical data warehouse of Rennes academic hospital. We also used OrientDb, a graph database to store informations from five drug knowledge databases and Spark to perform analysis of potential interactions betweens drugs taken by hospitalized patients. Then, we developed a machine learning model to identify the patients in whom an ADE might have occurred because of a DDI. The DDI detection system worked efficiently and computation time was manageable. The system could be routinely employed for monitoring.

AB  - We present and test the intuition that letters to the editor in journals carry early signals of adverse drug events (ADEs). Surprisingly these letters have not yet been exploited for automatic ADE detection unlike for example, clinical records and PubMed. Part of the challenge is that it is not easy to access the full-text of letters (for the most part these do not appear in PubMed). Also letters are likely underrated in comparison with full articles. Besides demonstrating that this intuition holds we contribute techniques for post market drug surveillance. Specifically, we test an automatic approach for ADE detection from letters using off-the-shelf machine learning tools. We also involve natural language processing for feature definitions. Overall we achieve high accuracy in our experiments and our method also works well on a second new test set. Our results encourage us to further pursue this line of research.

AB  - Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are frequent and associated to significant morbidity, mortality and costs. Therefore, their early detection in the hospital context is vital. Automatic tools could be developed taking into account structured and textual data. In this paper, we present the methodology followed for the manual annotation and automatic classification of discharge letters from a tertiary hospital. The results show that ADRs and causal drugs are explicitly mentioned in the discharge letters and that machine learning algorithms are efficient for the automatic detection of documents containing mentions of ADRs.

AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to assess the impact of automatically detected adverse event signals from text and open-source data on the prediction of drug label changes. METHODS: Open-source adverse effect data were collected from FAERS, Yellow Cards and SIDER databases. A shallow linguistic relation extraction system (JSRE) was applied for extraction of adverse effects from MEDLINE case reports. Statistical approach was applied on the extracted datasets for signal detection and subsequent prediction of label changes issued for 29 drugs by the UK Regulatory Authority in 2009. RESULTS: 76% of drug label changes were automatically predicted. Out of these, 6% of drug label changes were detected only by text mining. JSRE enabled precise identification of four adverse drug events from MEDLINE that were undetectable otherwise. CONCLUSIONS: Changes in drug labels can be predicted automatically using data and text mining techniques. Text mining technology is mature and well-placed to support the pharmacovigilance tasks.

AB  - Despite tremendous efforts made before the release of every drug, some adverse drug reactions (ADRs) may go undetected and thus, cause harm to both the users and to the pharmaceutical companies. One plausible venue to collect evidence of such ADRs is online social media, where patients and doctors discuss medical conditions and their treatments. There is substantial previous research on ADRs extraction from English online forums. However, very limited research was done on Chinese data. In this paper, we try to use the posts from two popular Chinese social media as the original dataset. We propose a semi-supervised learning framework that detects mentions of medications and colloquial ADR terms and extracts lexicon-syntactic features from natural language text to recognize positive associations between drug use and ADRs. The key contribution is an automatic label generation algorithm, which requires very little manual annotation. This bootstrapping algorithm could also be further applied on English data. The research results indicate that our algorithm outperforms the hidden Markov model and conditional random fields. With this approach, we discovered a large number of side effects for a variety of popular medicines in real world scenarios.

AB  - BACKGROUND: User-generated medical messages on Internet contain extensive information related to adverse drug reactions (ADRs) and are known as valuable resources for post-marketing drug surveillance. The aim of this study was to find an effective method to identify messages related to ADRs automatically from online user reviews. METHODS: We conducted experiments on online user reviews using different feature set and different classification technique. Firstly, the messages from three communities, allergy community, schizophrenia community and pain management community, were collected, the 3000 messages were annotated. Secondly, the N-gram-based features set and medical domain-specific features set were generated. Thirdly, three classification techniques, SVM, C4.5 and Naïve Bayes, were used to perform classification tasks separately. Finally, we evaluated the performance of different method using different feature set and different classification technique by comparing the metrics including accuracy and F-measure. RESULTS: In terms of accuracy, the accuracy of SVM classifier was higher than 0.8, the accuracy of C4.5 classifier or Naïve Bayes classifier was lower than 0.8; meanwhile, the combination feature sets including n-gram-based feature set and domain-specific feature set consistently outperformed single feature set. In terms of F-measure, the highest F-measure is 0.895 which was achieved by using combination feature sets and a SVM classifier. In all, we can get the best classification performance by using combination feature sets and SVM classifier. CONCLUSION: By using combination feature sets and SVM classifier, we can get an effective method to identify messages related to ADRs automatically from online user reviews.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) is a repository of spontaneously-reported adverse drug events (ADEs) for FDA-approved prescription drugs. FAERS reports include both structured reports and unstructured narratives. The narratives often include essential information for evaluation of the severity, causality, and description of ADEs that are not present in the structured data. The timely identification of unknown toxicities of prescription drugs is an important, unsolved problem. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to develop an annotated corpus of FAERS narratives and biomedical named entity tagger to automatically identify ADE related information in the FAERS narratives. METHODS: We developed an annotation guideline and annotate medication information and adverse event related entities on 122 FAERS narratives comprising approximately 23,000 word tokens. A named entity tagger using supervised machine learning approaches was built for detecting medication information and adverse event entities using various categories of features. RESULTS: The annotated corpus had an agreement of over .9 Cohen's kappa for medication and adverse event entities. The best performing tagger achieves an overall performance of 0.73 F1 score for detection of medication, adverse event and other named entities. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we developed an annotated corpus of FAERS narratives and machine learning based models for automatically extracting medication and adverse event information from the FAERS narratives. Our study is an important step towards enriching the FAERS data for postmarketing pharmacovigilance.

AB  - Purpose: To apply and evaluate Bayesian inter-product quantitative methods for signaling an excess of adverse events to specific pharmaceutical products, taking into account sales data as well as other information accessible to a company's drug-monitoring system. Methods: The Bayesian confidence propagation neural network (BCPNN) and the gamma Poisson shrinkage (GPS) were applied to a selected sample of spontaneously reported adverse events following the administration of a Bracco contrast medium. Both the conventional approach and sales data were exploited to represent the patients' population drug exposure. Results: Available data allow the detection of potential safety issues of a drug in comparison to those expected in its pharmaceutical category. No difference in signal detection performance between the BCPNN and GPS methods was found. Instead, adjustment by sales data markedly affected the signals detected, with the desirable property of preserving the risk order, for any given adverse drug reaction, among different drugs. Conclusions: Without comprehensive data on the adverse events reported worldwide for all pharmaceutical products, signaling methods are appropriate to compare the safety of drugs sharing a similar clinical indication. Sales data show a relevant impact on the value of signals, improving the analysis of spontaneous reports collected by a company monitoring system. Copyright © 2007 Drug Information Association, Inc.

AB  - Spontaneous adverse event reports have a high potential for detecting adverse drug reactions. However, due to their dimension, the analysis of such databases requires statistical methods. In this context, disproportionality measures can be used. Their main idea is to project the data onto contingency tables in order to measure the strength of associations between drugs and adverse events. However, due to the data projection, these methods are sensitive to the problem of coprescriptions and masking effects. Recently, logistic regressions have been used with a Lasso type penalty to perform the detection of associations between drugs and adverse events. On different examples, this approach limits the drawbacks of the disproportionality methods, but the choice of the penalty value is open to criticism while it strongly influences the results. In this paper, we propose to use a logistic regression whose sparsity is viewed as a model selection challenge. Since the model space is huge, a Metropolis-Hastings algorithm carries out the model selection by maximizing the BIC criterion. Thus, we avoid the calibration of penalty or threshold. During our application on the French pharmacovigilance database, the proposed method is compared to well-established approaches on a reference dataset, and obtains better rates of positive and negative controls. However, many signals (i.e., specific drug-event associations) are not detected by the proposed method. So, we conclude that this method should be used in parallel to existing measures in pharmacovigilance. Code implementing the proposed method is available at the following url: https://github.com/masedki/MHTrajectoryR.

AB  - An international database of case reports, each one describing a possible case of adverse drug reactions (ADRs), is maintained by the Uppsala Monitoring Centre (UMC), for the WHO international program on drug safety monitoring. Each report can be seen as a row in a data matrix and consists of a number of variables, like drugs used, ADRs, and other patient data. The problem is to examine the database and find significant dependencies which might be signals of potentially important ADRs, to be investigated by clinical experts. We propose a method by which estimated frequencies of combinations of variables are compared with the frequencies that would be predicted assuming there were no dependencies. The estimates of significance are obtained with a Bayesian approach via the variance of posterior probability distributions. The posterior is obtained by fusing a prior distribution (Dirichlet of dimension 2(n-1)) with a batch of data, which is also the prior used when the next batch of data arrives. To decide whether the joint probabilities of events are different fi-om what would follow from the independence assumption, the "information component" log(P-ij/(PiPj)) plays a crucial role, and one main technical contribution reported here is an efficient method to estimate this measure, as well as the variance of its posterior distribution, for large data matrices. The method we present is fundamentally an artificial neural network denoted Bayesian confidence propagation neural network (BCPNN). We also demonstrate an efficient way of finding complex dependencies. The method is now (autumn 1998) being routinely used to produce warning signals on new unexpected ADR associations.

AB  - Pharmacovigilance spontaneous reporting systems are primarily devoted to early detection of the adverse reactions of marketed drugs. They maintain large spontaneous reporting databases (SRD) for which several automatic signalling methods have been developed. A common limitation of these methods lies in the fact that they do not provide an auto-evaluation of the generated signals so that thresholds of alerts are arbitrarily chosen. In this paper, we propose to revisit the Gamma Poisson Shrinkage (GPS) model and the Bayesian Confidence Propagation Neural Network (BCPNN) model in the Bayesian general decision framework. This results in a new signal ranking procedure based on the posterior probability of null hypothesis of interest and makes it possible to derive with a non-mixture modelling approach Bayesian estimators of the false discovery rate (FDR), false negative rate, sensitivity and specificity. An original data generation process that can be suited to the features of the SRD under scrutiny is proposed and applied to the French SRD to perform a large simulation study. Results indicate better performances according to the FDR for the proposed ranking procedure in comparison with the current ones for the GPS model. They also reveal identical performances according to the four operating characteristics for the proposed ranking procedure with the BCPNN and GPS models but better estimates when using the GPS model. Finally, the proposed procedure is applied to the French data.

AB  - In this article, we present a new pharmacovigilance data mining technique based on the biclustering paradigm, which is designed to identify drug groups that share a common set of adverse events (AEs) in the spontaneous reporting system (SRS) of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). A taxonomy of biclusters is developed, revealing that a significant number of bona fide adverse drug event (ADE) biclusters have been identified. Statistical tests indicate that it is extremely unlikely that the bicluster structures thus discovered, as well as their content, could have arisen by mere chance. Some of the biclusters classified as indeterminate provide support for previously unrecognized and potentially novel ADEs. In addition, we demonstrate the potential importance of the proposed methodology in several important aspects of pharmacovigilance such as providing insight into the etiology of ADEs, facilitating the identification of novel ADEs, suggesting methods and a rationale for aggregating terminologies, highlighting areas of focus, and providing an exploratory tool for data mining. © 2011 american Society for Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics.

AB  - PURPOSE: A Bayesian confidence propagation neural network (BCPNN) is a signal detection method used by the World Health Organization Uppsala Monitoring Centre to analyze spontaneous reporting system databases. We modify the BCPNN to increase its sensitivity for detecting potential adverse drug reactions (ADRs). METHOD: In a BCPNN, the information component (IC) is defined as an index of disproportionality between the observed and expected number of reported drugs and events. Our proposed method adjusts the IC value by borrowing information about events that have occurred in drugs defined as similar to the target drug. We compare the performance of our method with that of a traditional BCPNN through a simulation study. RESULTS: The false positive rate of the proposed method was lower than that of the traditional BCPNN method and close to the nominal value, 0.025, around the true difference in ICs between the target drug and similar drugs equal to 0. The sensitivity of the proposed method was much higher than that of the traditional BCPNN method in case in which the difference in ICs between the target drug and similar drugs ranges from 0 to 2. When applied to a database managed by Japanese regulatory authority, the proposed method could detect known ADRs earlier than the traditional method. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed method is a novel criterion for early detection of signals if similar drugs have the same tendencies. The proposed BCPNN tends to have higher sensitivity when the true difference is greater than 0.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Uloric (Febuxostat) has been linked with cardiovascular thromboembolic events in gout patients. However, no post-marketing data analysis has investigated these drug-associated adverse event reports. The study objective was to identify febuxostat-associated cardiovascular thromboembolic event reports in the US using the Food and Drug Administration adverse event reporting system (AERS) database. METHODS: Reports listing uloric and febuxostat as the suspect drug and cardiovascular thromboembolic events (combined in a single term based on adverse event reports of myocardial infarction, stroke, among others) as the adverse event were extracted from the drug's approval date through the fourth quarter of 2011. Bayesian statistics within the neural network architecture was implemented to identify potential signals of febuxostat-associated cardiovascular thromboembolic events. A potential signal for the drug-adverse event combination reports is generated when the lower limit of the 95% two-sided confidence interval of the information component (IC), denoted by IC025 is greater than zero. RESULTS: Twenty-one combination reports of febuxostat-associated cardiovascular thromboembolic events were identified in gout patients in the US. The mean age of combination cases was 64 years. Potential signals (IC025 = 4.09) was generated for combination reports of febuxostat-associated cardiovascular thromboembolic events. CONCLUSION: AERS indicated potential signals of febuxostat-associated cardiovascular thromboembolic events. AERS is not capable of establishing the causal link and detecting the true frequency of an adverse event associated with a drug. The positive IC value found in this study merits continued surveillance and assessment of cardiovascular thromboembolic events associated with Febuxostat.

AB  - In pharmacovigilance, reported cases are considered suspected adverse drug reactions (ADR). Health authorities have thus adopted structured causality assessment methods, allowing the evaluation of the likelihood that a drug was the causal agent of an adverse reaction. The aim of this work was to develop and validate a new causality assessment support system used in a regional pharmacovigilance centre. A Bayesian network was developed, for which the structure was defined by experts while the parameters were learnt from 593 completely filled ADR reports evaluated by the Portuguese Northern Pharmacovigilance Centre medical expert between 2000 and 2012. Precision, recall and time to causality assessment (TTA) was evaluated, according to the WHO causality assessment guidelines, in a retrospective cohort of 466 reports (April–September 2014) and a prospective cohort of 1041 reports (January–December 2015). Additionally, a simplified assessment matrix was derived from the model, enabling its preliminary direct use by notifiers. Results show that the network was able to easily identify the higher levels of causality (recall above 80%), although struggling to assess reports with a lower level of causality. Nonetheless, the median (Q1:Q3) TTA was 4 (2:8) days using the network and 8 (5:14) days using global introspection, meaning the network allowed a faster time to assessment, which has a procedural deadline of 30 days, improving daily activities in the centre. The matrix expressed similar validity, allowing an immediate feedback to the notifiers, which may result in better future engagement of patients and health professionals in the pharmacovigilance system.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Detecting adverse drug reactions (ADRs) is an important task that has direct implications for the use of that drug. If we can detect previously unknown ADRs as quickly as possible, then this information can be provided to the regulators, pharmaceutical companies, and health care organizations, thereby potentially reducing drug-related morbidity and saving lives of many patients. A promising approach for detecting ADRs is to use social media platforms such as Twitter and Facebook. A high level of correlation between a drug name and an event may be an indication of a potential adverse reaction associated with that drug. Although numerous association measures have been proposed by the signal detection community for identifying ADRs, these measures are limited in that they detect correlations but often ignore causality. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to propose a causality measure that can detect an adverse reaction that is caused by a drug rather than merely being a correlated signal. METHODS: To the best of our knowledge, this was the first causality-sensitive approach for detecting ADRs from social media. Specifically, the relationship between a drug and an event was represented using a set of automatically extracted lexical patterns. We then learned the weights for the extracted lexical patterns that indicate their reliability for expressing an adverse reaction of a given drug. RESULTS: Our proposed method obtains an ADR detection accuracy of 74% on a large-scale manually annotated dataset of tweets, covering a standard set of drugs and adverse reactions. CONCLUSIONS: By using lexical patterns, we can accurately detect the causality between drugs and adverse reaction-related events.

AB  - It is important to detect signals of abrupt changes in adverse event reporting in order to notice public safety concerns and take prompt action, especially for vaccines under national immunization programs. In this study, we assessed the applicability of change point analysis (CPA) for signal detection in vaccine safety surveillance. The performances of three CPA methods, namely Bayesian change point analysis, Taylor’s change point analysis (Taylor-CPA), and environmental time series change point detection (EnvCpt), were assessed via simulated data with assumptions for the baseline number of events and degrees of change. The analysis was validated using the Korea Adverse Event Reporting System (KAERS) database. In the simulation study, the Taylor-CPA method exhibited better results for the detection of a change point (accuracy of 96% to 100%, sensitivity of 7% to 100%, specificity of 98% to 100%, positive predictive value of 25% to 85%, negative predictive value of 96% to 100%, and balanced accuracy of 53% to 100%) than the other two CPA methods. When the CPA methods were applied to reports of syncope or dizziness following human papillomavirus (HPV) immunization in the KAERS database, Taylor-CPA and EnvCpt detected a change point (Q2/2013), which was consistent with actual public safety concerns. CPA can be applied as an efficient tool for the early detection of vaccine safety signals.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study extends prior research by combining a chronological pharmacovigilance network approach with machine-learning (ML) techniques to predict adverse drug events (ADEs) based on the drugs' similarities in terms of the proteins they target in the human body. The focus of this research, though, is particularly centered on predicting the drug-ADE associations for a set of 8 common and high-risk ADEs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: large collection of annotated MEDLINE biomedical articles was used to construct a drug-ADE network, and the network was further equipped with information about drugs' target proteins. Several network metrics were extracted and used as predictors in ML algorithms to predict the existence of network edges (ie, associations or relationships). RESULTS: Gradient boosted trees (GBTs) as an ensemble ML algorithm outperformed other prediction methods in identifying the drug-ADE associations with an overall accuracy of 92.8% on the validation sample. The prediction model was able to predict drug-ADE associations, on average, 3.84 years earlier than they were actually mentioned in the biomedical literature. CONCLUSION: While network analysis and ML techniques were used in separation in prior ADE studies, our results showed that they, in combination with each other, can boost the power of one another and predict better. Moreover, our results highlight the superior capability of ensemble-type ML methods in capturing drug-ADE patterns compared to the regular (ie, singular), ML algorithms.

AB  - This work focuses on adverse drug reaction extraction tackling the class imbalance problem. Adverse drug reactions are infrequent events in electronic health records, nevertheless, it is compulsory to get them documented. Text mining techniques can help to retrieve this kind of valuable information from text. The class imbalance was tackled using different sampling methods, cost-sensitive learning, ensemble learning and one-class classification and the Random Forest classifier was used. The adverse drug reaction extraction model was inferred from a dataset that comprises real electronic health records with an imbalance ratio of 1:222, this means that for each drug-disease pair that is an adverse drug reaction, there are approximately 222 that are not adverse drug reactions. The application of a sampling technique before using cost-sensitive learning offered the best result. On the test set, the f-measure was 0.121 for the minority class and 0.996 for the majority class.

AB  - Background All methods routinely used to generate safety signals from pharmacovigilance databases rely on disproportionality analyses of counts aggregating patients' spontaneous reports. Recently, it was proposed to analyze individual spontaneous reports directly using Bayesian lasso logistic regressions. Nevertheless, this raises the issue of choosing an adequate regularization parameter in a variable selection framework while accounting for computational constraints due to the high dimension of the data. Purpose Our main objective is to propose a method, which exploits the subsampling idea from Stability Selection, a variable selection procedure combining subsampling with a high-dimensional selection algorithm, and adapts it to the specificities of the spontaneous reporting data, the latter being characterized by their large size, their binary nature and their sparsity. Materials and method Given the large imbalance existing between the presence and absence of a given adverse event, we propose an alternative subsampling scheme to that of Stability Selection resulting in an over-representation of the minority class and a drastic reduction in the number of observations in each subsample. Simulations are used to help define the detection threshold as regards the average proportion of false signals. They are also used to compare the performances of the proposed sampling scheme with that originally proposed for Stability Selection. Finally, we compare the proposed method to the gamma Poisson shrinker, a disproportionality method, and to a lasso logistic regression approach through an empirical study conducted on the French national pharmacovigilance database and two sets of reference signals. Results Simulations show that the proposed sampling strategy performs better in terms of false discoveries and is faster than the equiprobable sampling of Stability Selection. The empirical evaluation illustrates the better performances of the proposed method compared with gamma Poisson shrinker and the lasso in terms of number of reference signals retrieved.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Adverse drug events (ADEs) as well as other preventable adverse events in the hospital setting incur a yearly monetary cost of approximately $3.5 billion, in the United States alone. Therefore, it is of paramount importance to reduce the impact and prevalence of ADEs within the healthcare sector, not only since it will result in reducing human suffering, but also as a means to substantially reduce economical strains on the healthcare system. One approach to mitigate this problem is to employ predictive models. While existing methods have been focusing on the exploitation of static features, limited attention has been given to temporal features. METHODS: In this paper, we present a novel classification framework for detecting ADEs in complex Electronic health records (EHRs) by exploiting the temporality and sparsity of the underlying features. The proposed framework consists of three phases for transforming sparse and multi-variate time series features into a single-valued feature representation, which can then be used by any classifier. Moreover, we propose and evaluate three different strategies for leveraging feature sparsity by incorporating it into the new representation. RESULTS: A large-scale evaluation on 15 ADE datasets extracted from a real-world EHR system shows that the proposed framework achieves significantly improved predictive performance compared to state-of-the-art. Moreover, our framework can reveal features that are clinically consistent with medical findings on ADE detection. CONCLUSIONS: Our study and experimental findings demonstrate that temporal multi-variate features of variable length and with high sparsity can be effectively utilized to predict ADEs from EHRs. Two key advantages of our framework are that it is method agnostic, i.e., versatile, and of low computational cost, i.e., fast; hence providing an important building block for future exploitation within the domain of machine learning from EHRs.

AB  - An important aspect of post-marketing drug surveillance involves identifying potential side-effects utilizing adverse drug event (ADE) reporting systems and/or Electronic Health Records. These data are noisy, necessitating identified drug/ADE associations be manually reviewed - a human-intensive process that scales poorly with large numbers of possibly dangerous associations and rapid growth of biomedical literature. Recent work has employed Literature Based Discovery methods that exploit implicit relationships between biomedical entities within the literature to estimate the plausibility of drug/ADE connections. We extend this work by evaluating machine learning classifiers applied to high-dimensional vector representations of relationships extracted from the literature as a means to identify substantiated drug/ADE connections. Using a curated reference standard, we show applying classifiers to such representations improves performance (+≈37%AUC) over previous approaches. These trained systems reproduce outcomes of the manual literature review process used to create the reference standard, but further research is required to establish their generalizability.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Nowadays, social media are often being used by general public to create and share public messages related to their health. With the global increase in social media usage, there is a trend of posting information related to adverse drug reactions (ADR). Mining the social media data for this type of information will be helpful for pharmacological post-marketing surveillance and monitoring. Although the concept of using social media to facilitate pharmacovigilance is convincing, construction of automatic ADR detection systems remains a challenge because the corpora compiled from social media tend to be highly imbalanced, posing a major obstacle to the development of classifiers with reliable performance. METHODS: Several methods have been proposed to address the challenge of imbalanced corpora. However, we are not aware of any studies that investigated the effectiveness of the strategies of dealing with the problem of imbalanced data in the context of ADR detection from social media. In light of this, we evaluated a variety of imbalanced techniques and proposed a novel word embedding-based synthetic minority over-sampling technique (WESMOTE), which synthesizes new training examples from the sentence representation based on word embeddings. We compared the performance of all methods on two large imbalanced datasets released for the purpose of detecting ADR posts. RESULTS: In comparison with the state-of-the-art approaches, the classifiers that incorporated imbalanced classification techniques achieved comparable or better F-scores. All of our best performing configurations combined random under-sampling with techniques including the proposed WESMOTE, boosting and ensemble, implying that an integration of these approaches with under-sampling provides a reliable solution for large imbalanced social media datasets. Furthermore, ensemble-based methods like vote-based under-sampling (VUE) and random under-sampling boosting can be alternatives for the hybrid synthetic methods because both methods increase the diversity of the created weak classifiers, leading to better recall and overall F-scores for the minority classes. CONCLUSIONS: Data collected from the social media are usually very large and highly imbalanced. In order to maximize the performance of a classifier trained on such data, applications of imbalanced strategies are required. We considered several practical methods for handling imbalanced Twitter data along with their performance on the binary classification task with respect to ADRs. In conclusion, the following practical insights are gained: 1) When dealing with text classification, the proposed word embedding-based synthetic minority over-sampling technique is more effective than traditional synthetic-based over-sampling methods. 2) In cases where large amounts of training data are available, the imbalanced strategies combined with under-sampling techniques are preferred. 3) Finally, employment of advanced methods does not guarantee better performance than simpler ones such as VUE, which achieved high performance with advantages like faster building time and ease of development.

AB  - Backgrounds: Acute pancreatitis (AP) has been reported in patients treated with protease inhibitors (PIs), but there are few real-world studies comparing the occurrence and characteristics of AP after different PI regimens. Research design and methods: Disproportionality analysis and Bayesian analysis were utilized for data mining of the Food and Drug Administration’s Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database for suspected adverse events involving AP after PI. The times to onset and fatality rates of AP following different PI regimens were also compared. Results: Based on 33,832 reports related to PIs, 285 cases were associated with AP, involving with 12 out of the 15 studied PIs. Of all the reported AP events related to PIs, 64.56% occurred in men and the median time to onset of AP was 103 (IQR: 26–408) days after the initiation of PI treatment with a fatality rate of 14.02%. Among all PI therapies, indinavir was notably associated with AP, and ritonavir and lopinavir/ritonavir-induced AP cases appeared to be associated with a higher risk of death. Conclusions: Most of PIs were associated with AP-related adverse events, among which indinavir has a stronger association with AP but there is no significant difference in fatality rates.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Medication and adverse drug event (ADE) information extracted from electronic health record (EHR) notes can be a rich resource for drug safety surveillance. Existing observational studies have mainly relied on structured EHR data to obtain ADE information; however, ADEs are often buried in the EHR narratives and not recorded in structured data. OBJECTIVE: To unlock ADE-related information from EHR narratives, there is a need to extract relevant entities and identify relations among them. In this study, we focus on relation identification. This study aimed to evaluate natural language processing and machine learning approaches using the expert-annotated medical entities and relations in the context of drug safety surveillance, and investigate how different learning approaches perform under different configurations. METHODS: We have manually annotated 791 EHR notes with 9 named entities (eg, medication, indication, severity, and ADEs) and 7 different types of relations (eg, medication-dosage, medication-ADE, and severity-ADE). Then, we explored 3 supervised machine learning systems for relation identification: (1) a support vector machines (SVM) system, (2) an end-to-end deep neural network system, and (3) a supervised descriptive rule induction baseline system. For the neural network system, we exploited the state-of-the-art recurrent neural network (RNN) and attention models. We report the performance by macro-averaged precision, recall, and F1-score across the relation types. RESULTS: Our results show that the SVM model achieved the best average F1-score of 89.1% on test data, outperforming the long short-term memory (LSTM) model with attention (F1-score of 65.72%) as well as the rule induction baseline system (F1-score of 7.47%) by a large margin. The bidirectional LSTM model with attention achieved the best performance among different RNN models. With the inclusion of additional features in the LSTM model, its performance can be boosted to an average F1-score of 77.35%. CONCLUSIONS: It shows that classical learning models (SVM) remains advantageous over deep learning models (RNN variants) for clinical relation identification, especially for long-distance intersentential relations. However, RNNs demonstrate a great potential of significant improvement if more training data become available. Our work is an important step toward mining EHRs to improve the efficacy of drug safety surveillance. Most importantly, the annotated data used in this study will be made publicly available, which will further promote drug safety research in the community.

AB  - Combining drugs, a phenomenon often referred to as polypharmacy, can induce additional adverse effects. The identification of adverse combinations is a key task in pharmacovigilance. In this context, in silico approaches based on machine learning are promising as they can learn from a limited number of combinations to predict for all. In this work, we identify various subtasks in predicting effects caused by drug-drug interaction. Predicting drug-drug interaction effects for drugs that already exist is very different from predicting outcomes for newly developed drugs, commonly called a cold-start problem. We propose suitable validation schemes for the different subtasks that emerge. These validation schemes are critical to correctly assess the performance. We develop a new model that obtains AUC-ROC =0.843 for the hardest cold-start task up to AUC-ROC =0.957 for the easiest one on the benchmark dataset of Zitnik et al. Finally, we illustrate how our predictions can be used to improve post-market surveillance systems or detect drug-drug interaction effects earlier during drug development.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Although colitis has been reported in patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), associations between colitis and ICIs had not been thoroughly assessed in real-world studies. Here, we identified and characterized significant colitis-associated with ICIs. METHODS: Based on the Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) from January 2004 to December 2019, the disproportionality analysis and Bayesian analysis, including the reporting odds ratio (ROR), the proportional reporting ratio (PRR), the Bayesian confidence propagation neural network (BCPNN) and the multi-item gamma Poisson shrinker (MGPS) algorithms were adopted to data mining of the suspected adverse events of colitis after ICIs administrating. Clinical characteristics of patients with ICIs-associated colitis and the time to onset of colitis following different ICI regimens were collected. RESULTS: A total of 3786 reports of colitis adverse events were identified with ICIs. Seven ICI monotherapies were associated with the reporting of colitis. Statistically significant ROR, PRR, information component (IC), and empirical Bayesian geometric mean (EBGM) emerged for all ICI monotherapies and combination therapies. ICIs-associated colitis affected mostly male (53.51%), with a wide mean age range (60.65 to 72 years). Colitis adverse events were commonly reported in patients with melanoma and lung cancer. Adverse outcomes of colitis concerning ICI were mainly outcomes of hospitalization-initiated or prolonged and other serious. Among colitis cases, 17.43% cases of colitis concerning ICI lead to death. The adverse event ofcolitis occurred earliest in ipilimumab monotherapy with a median time to onset of 64.21 days (IQR: 27-69 days) among all monotherapies. CONCLUSIONS: ICI may lead to severe and disabling ICIs-associated colitis during therapy. Analysis of FAERS data identified signals for adverse events of colitis with ICI regimens. Practitioners should consider the factors that may increase the likelihood of colitis. The findings support a continued surveillance and risk factor identification studies.

AB  - Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are an essential part of the analysis of drug use, measuring drug use benefits, and making policy decisions. Traditional channels for identifying ADRs are reliable but very slow and only produce a small amount of data. Text reviews, either on specialized web sites or in general-purpose social networks, may lead to a data source of unprecedented size, but identifying ADRs in free-form text is a challenging natural language processing problem. In this work, we propose a novel model for this problem, uniting recurrent neural architectures and conditional random fields. We evaluate our model with a comprehensive experimental study, showing improvements over state-of-the-art methods of ADR extraction.

AB  - Drug toxicity is a major concern for both regulatory agencies and the pharmaceutical industry. In this context, text-mining methods for the identification of drug side effects from free text are key for the development of up-to-date knowledge sources on drug adverse reactions. We present a new system for identification of drug side effects from the literature that combines three approaches: machine learning, rule- and knowledge-based approaches. This system has been developed to address the Task 3.B of Biocreative V challenge (BC5) dealing with Chemical-induced Disease (CID) relations. The first two approaches focus on identifying relations at the sentence-level, while the knowledge-based approach is applied both at sentence and abstract levels. The machine learning method is based on the BeFree system using two corpora as training data: the annotated data provided by the CID task organizers and a new CID corpus developed by crowdsourcing. Different combinations of results from the three strategies were selected for each run of the challenge. In the final evaluation setting, the system achieved the highest Recall of the challenge (63%). By performing an error analysis, we identified the main causes of misclassifications and areas for improving of our system, and highlighted the need of consistent gold standard data sets for advancing the state of the art in text mining of drug side effects.Database URL: https://zenodo.org/record/29887?ln¼en#.VsL3yDLWR_V.

AB  - Polypharmacy is common, and may modify mechanisms of drug-induced liver injury. We examined the effect of these drug-drug interactions on liver safety reports of four drugs highly associated with hepatotoxicity. In the WHO VigiBase™, liver event reports were examined for acetaminophen, isoniazid, valproic acid, and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid. Then, we evaluated the liver event reporting frequency of these 4 drugs in the presence of co-reported medications. Each of the 4 primary drugs was reported as having more than 2000 liver events, and co-reported with more than 600 different medications. Overall, the effect of 2275 co-reported drugs (316 drug classes) on the reporting frequency was analyzed. Decreased liver event reporting frequency was associated with 245 drugs/122 drug classes, including anti-TNFα, opioids, and folic acid. Increased liver event reporting frequency was associated with 170 drugs/82 drug classes; in particular, halogenated hydrocarbons, carboxamides, and bile acid sequestrants. After adjusting for age, gender, and other co-reported drug classes, multiple co-reported drug classes were significantly associated with decreased/increased liver event reporting frequency in a drug-specific/unspecific manner. In conclusion, co-reported medications were associated with changes in the liver event reporting frequency of drugs commonly associated with hepatotoxicity, suggesting that comedications may modify drug hepatic safety.

AB  - Objectives: Data mining algorithms have been developed for the quantitative detection of drug-associated adverse events (signals) from a large database on spontaneously reported adverse events. In the present study, the commonality of signals detected by 4 commonly used data mining algorithms was examined. Methods: A total of 2,231,029 reports were retrieved from the public release of the US Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System database between 2004 and 2009. The deletion of duplicated submissions and revision of arbitrary drug names resulted in a reduction in the number of reports to 1,644,220. Associations with adverse events were analyzed for 16 unrelated drugs, using the proportional reporting ratio (PRR), reporting odds ratio (ROR), information component (IC), and empirical Bayes geometric mean (EBGM). Results: All EBGM-based signals were included in the PRR-based signals as well as IC- or ROR-based ones, and PRR- and IC-based signals were included in ROR-based ones. The PRR scores of PRR-based signals were significantly larger for 15 of 16 drugs when adverse events were also detected as signals by the EBGM method, as were the IC scores of IC-based signals for all drugs; however, no such effect was observed in the ROR scores of ROR-based signals. Conclusions: The EBGM method was the most conservative among the 4 methods examined, which suggested its better suitability for pharmacoepidemiological studies. Further examinations should be performed on the reproducibility of clinical observations, especially for EBGM-based signals. © Ivyspring International Publisher.

AB  - Patients subjected to medical treatments are often susceptible to adverse drug reactions. Many comorbid disease conditions arise as a result of adverse drug reactions which in turn increase the complexity of treatment procedures. Usually the side effects of a drug are identified prior to its introduction into market. But many of the adverse reactions can be identified only after the post-marketing phase. Once the possible adverse reactions of a drug are known, then effective steps can be taken to alleviate the reaction. The objective of this research is to compare the existing techniques used in the prediction of adverse reactions of drug by combining information from electronic health records and online healthcare forums. Adverse reactions of drug are predicted using 4 separate classifiers: SVM, Naïve Bayes, Decision Tree and KNN. Individual classifiers were tested and the accuracy seemed to be increased when using an ensemble of these classifiers. Among the 4 classifiers, SVM showed an accuracy of 84%. Usage of ensemble classifier improved the accuracy to 87%.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Medication  safety requires that each drug be monitored throughout its market life as early detection of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) can lead to alerts that prevent patient harm. Recently, electronic medical records (EMRs) have emerged as a valuable resource for pharmacovigilance. This study examines the use of retrospective medication orders and inpatient laboratory results documented in the EMR to identify ADRs. METHODS: Using 12 years of EMR data from Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC), we designed a study to correlate abnormal laboratory results with specific drug administrations by comparing the outcomes of a drug-exposed group and a matched unexposed group. We assessed the relative merits of six pharmacovigilance measures used in spontaneous reporting systems (SRSs): proportional reporting ratio (PRR), reporting OR (ROR), Yule's Q (YULE), the χ(2) test (CHI), Bayesian confidence propagation neural networks (BCPNN), and a gamma Poisson shrinker (GPS). RESULTS: We systematically evaluated the methods on two independently constructed reference standard datasets of drug-event pairs. The dataset of Yoon et al contained 470 drug-event pairs (10 drugs and 47 laboratory abnormalities). Using VUMC's EMR, we created another dataset of 378 drug-event pairs (nine drugs and 42 laboratory abnormalities). Evaluation on our reference standard showed that CHI, ROR, PRR, and YULE all had the same F score (62%). When the reference standard of Yoon et al was used, ROR had the best F score of 68%, with 77% precision and 61% recall. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that EMR-derived laboratory measurements and medication orders can help to validate previously reported ADRs, and detect new ADRs.

AB  - Objective: Signal detection is a technique in pharmacovigilance for the early detection of new, rare reactions (desired or undesired) of a drug. This study aims to compare and appraise the performance of data mining algorithms used in signal detection. Method: Most commonly used three data mining algorithms (DMAs) (Reporting Odds Ratio (ROR), Proportional Reporting Ratio (PRR) and Information Component (IC)) were selected and applied retrospectively in USFDA Adverse Event Reporting System database to detect five confirmed Drug Event Combinations. They were selected in such a way that the drug is withdrawn from the market or label change between 2006-2015. A value of ROR-1.96SE>1, PRR≥2, χ2>4 or IC- 2SD>0 were considered as the positive signal. The data mining algorithms were compared for their sensitivity and early detection. Result: Among the three data mining algorithms, Information Component was found to have a maximum sensitivity (100%) followed by Reporting Odds Ratio (60%) and Proportional Reporting Ratio (40%). Sensitivity associated with the number of reports per drug event combination and early signal detection suggested that information component needs comparatively fewer reports to show positive signal than the other two data mining algorithms. ROR and PRR showed comparable results. Conclusion: Early detection of a reaction is possible using signal detection technique. Information component was found to be sensitive method compared with other two data mining algorithms in FDA Adverse Event Reporting System database. As the number of reports of drug event combination increased, the sensitivity and comparability of data mining algorithm also increased.

AB  - Electronic health records (EHRs) linked with biobanks have been recognized as valuable data sources for pharmacogenomic studies, which require identification of patients with certain adverse drug reactions (ADRs) from a large population. Since manual chart review is costly and time-consuming, automatic methods to accurately identify patients with ADRs have been called for. In this study, we developed and compared different informatics approaches to identify ADRs from EHRs, using clopidogrel-induced bleeding as our case study. Three different types of methods were investigated: 1) rule-based methods; 2) machine learning-based methods; and 3) scoring function-based methods. Our results show that both machine learning and scoring methods are effective and the scoring method can achieve a high precision with a reasonable recall. We also analyzed the contributions of different types of features and found that the temporality information between clopidogrel and bleeding events, as well as textual evidence from physicians' assertion of the adverse events are helpful. We believe that our findings are valuable in advancing EHR-based pharmacogenomic studies.

AB  - Purpose: To detect the signals of celecoxib compared with other analgesics and anti-inflammatory drugs (AAIDs) by proportional claims ratio (PCR), claims odds ratio (COR), information component (IC), and relative risk (RR) using the Korean claims database. In addition, the concordance of the identified signals by the data-mining indices (DMIs) and the validity of the DMIs were evaluated. Methods: The Korean Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service claims database was used. The study population consisted of elderly ambulatory care patients with osteoarthritis who were prescribed AAIDs in Seoul from 1 January 2005 to 30 September 2005. A short-term serious adverse event (SAE) was defined as a hospital admission within 12weeks from each AAID prescription. Among the screened SAEs, signals were identified by the DMIs. The sensitivity, specificity, and predictability were estimated with reference to known adverse events associated with celecoxib. Results: A total of 135232 elderly patients with osteoarthritis were prescribed AAIDs. There were 309717 drug-SAE pairs and 481 different SAEs. The PCR, COR, IC, and RR detected were as follows: 56 (11.6%), 57 (11.9%), 129 (26.8%), and 123 (25.6%) signals for celecoxib, respectively. The RR detected signals had a relatively high sensitivity (23.4%) compared with the other indices (PCR 9.9%, COR 10.8%, and IC 18.9%). The specificity of RR (73.8%) was higher than that of IC (70.8%). The positive and negative predictive values of the RR were 21.1% and 76.3%, respectively. Conclusion: This study suggested that the RR was the most accurate of the DMIs for detecting signals in the claims database. © 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - PURPOSE: Five data mining methodologies for detecting a possible signal from spontaneous reports on adverse drug reactions (ADRs) were compared. METHODS: The five methodologies, the Bayesian method using the Gamma Poissson Shrinker (GPS), the method employed in the UK Medicines Control Agency (MCA), the Bayesian Confidence Propagation Neural Network (BCPNN), the method using the 95% confidence interval (CI) for the reporting odds ratio (RORCI) and that using the 95% CI of the proportional reporting ratio (PRRCI) were compared using Japanese data obtained between 1998 and 2000. RESULTS: There were all in all 38,731 drug-ADR combinations. The count of drug-ADR pairs was equal to 1 or 2 for 31,230 combinations and none of them were identified as a possible signal with the MCA or BCPNN. Similarly, the GPS detected a possible signal in none of the combinations where the count was equal to 1 but in 7.5% of the combinations where the count was equal to 2. The RORCI and PRRCI detected a possible signal in more than half of the combinations where the count was equal to 1 or 2. When the pairwise agreement on whether or not a drug-ADR combination satisfied the criteria for a possible signal was assessed for the 38,731 combinations, the concordance measure kappa was greater than 0.9 between the MCA and BCPNN and between the RORCI and PRRCI. Kappa was around 0.6 between the GPS and MCA and between the GPS and BCPNN. Otherwise, kappa was smaller than 0.2. CONCLUSIONS: The drug-ADR combinations detected as a possible signal vary between different methodologies.

AB  - There are several different proposed data mining methods for the postmarketing surveillance of drug safety. Adverse events are often classified into a hierarchical structure. Our objective was to compare the performance of several of these different data mining methods for adverse drug events data with a hierarchical structure. We generated datasets based on the World Health Organization's Adverse Reaction Terminology (WHO-ART) hierarchical structure. We evaluated different data mining methods for signal detection, including several frequentist methods such as reporting odds ratio (ROR), proportional reporting ratio (PRR), information component (IC), the likelihood ratio test-based method (LRT), and Bayesian methods such as gamma Poisson shrinker (GPS), Bayesian confidence propagating neural network (BCPNN), the new IC method, and the simplified Bayesian method (sB), as well as the tree-based scan statistic through an extensive simulation study. We also applied the methods to real data on two diabetes drugs, voglibose and acarbose, from the Korea Adverse event reporting system. Only the tree-based scan statistic method maintained the type I error rate at the desired level. Likelihood ratio test-based methods and Bayesian methods tended to be more conservative than other methods in the simulation study and detected fewer signals in the real data example. No method was superior to the others in terms of the statistical power and sensitivity of detecting true signals. It is recommended that those conducting drug‒adverse event surveillance use not just one method, but make a decision based on several methods.

AB  - PURPOSE: To examine the concordance of various measures to Bayesian Confidence Propagation Neural Network (BCPNN) measure used by the WHO Collaborating Centre for International Drug Monitoring based on the database of Guangdong province in China. METHODS: The Reporting Odds Ratio (ROR)--1.96 standard errors (SE), Proportional Reporting Ratio (PRR)--21.96 SE, combination chi (2)-PRR measure used by the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) were compared with the IC--2 standard deviations (SDs) with the tested database collected from 1 January 2002 to 30 June 2007 in Guangdong. Additionally, the concordance of the various measures, in respect to the number of reports per combination, was examined. RESULTS: Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value were high in respect to the BCPNN measure when a combination of point and interval estimate was used based on four types of signal detection for the ROR and PRR measures, and the four evaluation indexes increased when A (the number of reports per combination) increased. However the MHRA measure had decreasing sensitivity and increasing specificity with A increasing. CONCLUSIONS: The ROR, PRR and BCPNN measures used are broadly comparable when three or more cases per combination have been collected. The MHRA measure is comparable to the BCPNN when seven or less case per combination have been collected for 'drug-ADR', 'drug category-ADR', 'drug-ADR category' combinations based on the Guangdong database, and the MHRA is unsuitable for detecting signals from 'drug category-ADR category' combinations based on the Guangdong database because of its low sensitivity.

AB  - Purpose: Adverse events (AEs) caused by polypharmacy have recently become a clinical problem, and it is important to monitor the safety profile of drug-drug interactions (DDIs). Mining signals using the spontaneous reporting systems is a very effective method for single drug-induced AE monitoring as well as early detection of DDIs. The objective of this study was to compare signal detection algorithms for DDIs based on frequency statistical models. Methods: Five frequency statistical models: the Ω shrinkage measure, additive (risk difference), multiplicative (risk ratio), combination risk ratio, and chi-square statistics models were compared using the Japanese Adverse Drug Event Report (JADER) database as the spontaneous reporting system in Japan. The drugs targeted for the survey are all registered and classified as “suspect drugs” in JADER, and the AEs targeted for this study were the same as those in a previous study on Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS). Results: Of 3924 pairs that reported SJS, the number of signals detected by the Ω shrinkage measure, additive, multiplicative, combination risk ratio, and chi-square statistics models was 712, 3298, 2252, 739, and 1289 pairs, respectively. Among the five models, the Ω shrinkage measure model showed the most conservative signal detection tendency. Conclusion: Specifically, caution should be exercised when the number of reports is low because results differ depending on the statistical models. This study will contribute to the selection of appropriate statistical models to detect signals of potential DDIs.

AB  - Objectives: There are no pharmacovigilance studies on adverse event (AE) data for tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) inhibitors in South Korea. We analysed AEs induced by adalimumab, infliximab, and etanercept Methods: We used data from the Korea Institute of Drug Safety and Risk Management–Korea Adverse Events Reporting System Database (KIDS-KD) collected between 2005 and 2016. We used three different signal detection methods: proportional reporting ratio (PRR), reporting odds ratio (ROR), and information component (IC). The drug was compared with drug labels in the USA and Korea. Logistic regression analysis identified AEs that are more likely to occur with drug use. Results: Of the 5594 AEs identified, 350, 452, and 71 were related to adalimumab, infliximab, and etanercept, respectively. We identified seven new signals, which were not listed on drug labels in either Korea or the USA, for AEs associated with the study drugs: two for adalimumab (medication error and drug failure), two for infliximab (palpitation and temperature sensation change), and three for etanercept (hyperkeratosis, acne, and thyroid neoplasm malignant). Injection site pain (OR 6.14, 95% CI 1.15–32.74) and alopecia (OR 4.54, 95% CI 1.16–17.77) for adalimumab, chest pain (OR 6.01, 95% CI 1.35–26.77) for infliximab, and uveitis (OR 10.11, 95% CI 1.13–90.77) for etanercept were more likely to be reported in patients with each TNFα inhibitor than in those without, respectively. Conclusions: Seven new signals that were not included in the current label were identified for TNFα inhibitors and should be updated and monitored.Key Points• Large-scale spontaneous AE reporting data and data mining techniques are useful for detecting signals of rare AEs as well as common AEs induced by drugs.• Drug labels should be updated to reflect signals that are newly discovered by continuous monitoring.

AB  - PURPOSE: Adverse event (AE) identification in social media (SM) can be performed using various types of natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML). These methods can be categorized by complexity and precision level. Co-occurrence-based ML methods are rather basic, as they identify simultaneous appearance of drugs and clinical events in a single post. In contrast, statistical learning methods involve more complex NLP and identify drugs, events, and associations between them. We aimed to compare the ability of co-occurrence and NLP to identify AEs and signals of disproportionate reporting (SDR) in patient-generated SM. We also examined the performance of lift in SM-based signal detection (SD). METHODS: Our examination was performed in a corpus of SM posts crawled from open online patient forums and communities, using the spontaneously reported VigiBase data as reference data set. RESULTS: We found that co-occurrence and NLP produce AEs, which are 57% and 93% consistent with VigiBase AEs, respectively. Among the SDRs identified both in SM and in VigiBase, up to 55.3% were identified earlier in co-occurrence, and up to 32.1% were identified earlier in NLP-processed SM. Using lift in SM SD provided performance similar to frequentist methods, both in co-occurrence and in NLP-processed AEs. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that using SM as a data source complementary to traditional pharmacovigilance sources should be considered further. Various levels of SM processing may be considered, depending on the preferred policies and tolerance for false-positive to false-negative balance in routine pharmacovigilance processes.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: It is important to monitor the safety profile of drugs, and mining for strong associations between drugs and adverse events is an effective and inexpensive method of post-marketing safety surveillance. OBJECTIVE: The objective of our work was to compare the accuracy of both common and innovative methods of data mining for pharmacovigilance purposes. METHODS: We used the reference standard provided by the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership, which contains 398 drug-adverse event pairs (165 positive controls, 233 negative controls). Ten methods and algorithms were applied to the US FDA Adverse Event Reporting System data to investigate the 398 pairs. The ten methods include popular methods in the pharmacovigilance literature, newly developed pharmacovigilance methods as at 2018, and popular methods in the genome-wide association study literature. We compared their performance using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) plot, area under the curve (AUC), and Youden's index. RESULTS: The Bayesian confidence propagation neural network had the highest AUC overall. Monte Carlo expectation maximization, a method developed in 2018, had the second highest AUC and the highest Youden's index, and performed very well in terms of high specificity. The regression-adjusted gamma Poisson shrinkage model performed best under high-sensitivity requirements. CONCLUSION: Our results will be useful to help choose a method for a given desired level of specificity. Methods popular in the genome-wide association study literature did not perform well because of the sparsity of data and will need modification before their properties can be used in the drug-adverse event association problem.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: As a result of the well documented limitations of data collected by spontaneous reporting systems (SRS), such as bias and under-reporting, a number of authors have evaluated the utility of other data sources for the purpose of pharmacovigilance, including the biomedical literature. Previous work has demonstrated the utility of literature-derived distributed representations (concept embeddings) with machine learning for the purpose of drug side-effect prediction. In terms of data sources, these methods are complementary, observing drug safety from two different perspectives (knowledge extracted from the literature and statistics from SRS data). However, the combined utility of these pharmacovigilance methods has yet to be evaluated. OBJECTIVE: This research investigates the utility of directly or indirectly combining an observational signal from SRS with literature-derived distributed representations into a single feature vector or in an ensemble approach for downstream machine learning (logistic regression). METHODS: Leveraging a recently developed representation scheme, concept embeddings were generated from relational connections extracted from the literature and composed to represent drug and associated adverse reactions, as defined by two reference standards of positive (likely causal) and negative (no causal evidence) pairs. Embeddings were presented with and without common measures of observational signal from SRS sources to logistic regressors, and performance was evaluated with the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) area under the curve (AUC) metric. RESULTS: ROC AUC performance with these composite models improves up to ≈ 20% over SRS-based disproportionality metrics alone and exceeds the best prior results reported in the literature when models leverage both sources of information. CONCLUSIONS: Results from this study support the hypothesis that knowledge extracted from the literature can enhance the performance of SRS-based methods (and vice versa). Across reference sets, using literature and SRS information together performed better than using either source alone, providing strong support for the complementary nature of these approaches to post-marketing drug surveillance.

AB  - PURPOSE: We developed a computerized system for signal detection in spontaneous reporting system (SRS) of Shanghai. Data acquisition, data mining could be carried out automatically and the process of data preprocessing and cleaning could be facilitated. This system was expected to detect signals from SRS after drug licensing with minimum patient exposure. METHODS: This system was developed by Microsoft visual basic (VB) 6.0. Data preprocessing, data cleaning, and data mining were based upon visual basic for application (VBA) in Microsoft Excel 2003. Database of drug generic name and adverse drug reaction (ADR) standard dictionary were set up initially for data cleaning and coding. Algorithms including reporting odds ratio (ROR), proportional reporting ratio (PRR), measure used by the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), Bayesian confidence propagation neural network (BCPNN) were employed in this system. Crude ADR reports submitted to Shanghai ADR SRS from December 2003 to April 2007 were used as a material in this study to test the feasibility and flexibility of this system. RESULTS: Thirty two thousand seven hundred and fourty six crude ADR reports were acquired from the SRS automatically. Two thousand one hundred and fourty seven drug generic name and 621 ADR name were kept in the database after data preprocessing and cleaning. A total of 1430, 1419, 868 and 997 possible drug-ADR signals were generated by ROR, PRR, BCPNN and MHRA, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that this computerized system is a flexible one that can help to detect possible drug-ADR signals intelligently in SRS of Shanghai now. It is a promising system for post-marketing surveillance on both chemical medicine and Chinese traditional medicine.

AB  - Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) is one of the most common drug-induced adverse events (AEs) leading to life-threatening conditions such as acute liver failure. It has also been recognized as the single most common cause of safety-related post-market withdrawals or warnings. Efforts to develop new predictive methods to assess the likelihood of a drug being a hepatotoxicant have been challenging due to the complexity and idiosyncrasy of clinical manifestations of DILI. The FDA adverse event reporting system (AERS) contains post-market data that depict the morbidity of AEs. Here, we developed a scalable approach to construct a hepatotoxicity database using post-market data for the purpose of quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) modeling. A set of 2029 unique and modelable drug entities with 13,555 drug-AE combinations was extracted from the AERS database using 37 hepatotoxicity-related query preferred terms (PTs). In order to determine the optimal classification scheme to partition positive from negative drugs, a manually-curated DILI calibration set composed of 105 negatives and 177 positives was developed based on the published literature. The final classification scheme combines hepatotoxicity-related PT data with supporting information that optimize the predictive performance across the calibration set. Data for other toxicological endpoints related to liver injury such as liver enzyme abnormalities, cholestasis, and bile duct disorders, were also extracted and classified. Collectively, these datasets can be used to generate a battery of QSAR models that assess a drug's potential to cause DILI. © 2014.

AB  - BACKGROUND: We previously demonstrated that a general purpose text mining system, the Vaccine adverse event Text Mining (VaeTM) system, could be used to automatically classify reports of an-aphylaxis for post-marketing safety surveillance of vaccines. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the ability of VaeTM to classify reports to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) of possible Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS). METHODS: We used VaeTM to extract the key diagnostic features from the text of reports in VAERS. Then, we applied the Brighton Collaboration (BC) case definition for GBS, and an information retrieval strategy (i.e. the vector space model) to quantify the specific information that is included in the key features extracted by VaeTM and compared it with the encoded information that is already stored in VAERS as Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) Preferred Terms (PTs). We also evaluated the contribution of the primary (diagnosis and cause of death) and secondary (second level diagnosis and symptoms) diagnostic VaeTM-based features to the total VaeTM-based information. RESULTS: MedDRA captured more information and better supported the classification of reports for GBS than VaeTM (AUC: 0.904 vs. 0.777); the lower performance of VaeTM is likely due to the lack of extraction by VaeTM of specific laboratory results that are included in the BC criteria for GBS. On the other hand, the VaeTM-based classification exhibited greater specificity than the MedDRA-based approach (94.96% vs. 87.65%). Most of the VaeTM-based information was contained in the secondary diagnostic features. CONCLUSION: For GBS, clinical signs and symptoms alone are not sufficient to match MedDRA coding for purposes of case classification, but are preferred if specificity is the priority.

AB  - With the increased availability of large electronic health records databases comes the chance of enhancing health risks screening. Most post-marketing detection of adverse drug reaction (ADR) relies on physicians' spontaneous reports, leading to under-reporting. To take up this challenge, we develop a scalable model to estimate the effect of multiple longitudinal features (drug exposures) on a rare longitudinal outcome. Our procedure is based on a conditional Poisson regression model also known as self-controlled case series (SCCS). To overcome the need of precise risk periods specification, we model the intensity of outcomes using a convolution between exposures and step functions, which are penalized using a combination of group-Lasso and total-variation. Up to our knowledge, this is the first SCCS model with flexible intensity able to handle multiple longitudinal features in a single model. We show that this approach improves the state-of-the-art in terms of mean absolute error and computation time for the estimation of relative risks on simulated data. We apply this method on an ADR detection problem, using a cohort of diabetic patients extracted from the large French national health insurance database (SNIIRAM), a claims database containing medical reimbursements of more than 53 million people. This work has been done in the context of a research partnership between Ecole Polytechnique and CNAMTS (in charge of SNIIRAM).

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Several statistical methods exist for detecting signals of potential adverse drug reactions in spontaneous reporting databases. However, these signal-detection methods were developed using regulatory databases, which contain a far larger number of adverse event reports than the databases maintained by individual pharmaceutical manufacturers. Furthermore, the composition and quality of the spontaneous reporting databases differ between regulatory agencies and pharmaceutical companies. Thus, the signal-detection criteria proposed for regulatory use are considered to be inappropriate for pharmaceutical industry use without modification. The objective of this study was to revise the criteria for signal detection to make them suitable for use by pharmaceutical manufacturers. METHODS: A model comprising 40 drugs and 1000 adverse events was constructed based on a spontaneous reporting database provided by a pharmaceutical company and used in a simulation to investigate appropriate criteria for signal detection. In total, 1000 pseudo datasets were generated with this model, and three statistical methods (proportional reporting ratio [PRR], Bayesian Confidence Propagation Neural Network [BCPNN] and multi-item gamma Poisson shrinker [MGPS]) for signal detection were applied to each dataset. The sensitivity and specificity of each method were evaluated using these pseudo datasets. The optimum critical value for signal detection (i.e. the value that achieved the highest sensitivity with 95% specificity) was identified for each method. The optimum values were also examined with the adverse events classified into two categories according to frequency. The three original detection methods and their revised versions were applied to a real pharmaceutical company database to detect 173 known adverse reactions of four drugs. RESULTS: The 1000 pseudo datasets consisted of an average of 81 862 reports and 11,407 drug-event pairs, including 1192 adverse drug reactions. The sensitivities of PRR, BCPNN and MGPS methods were 49%, 45% and 26%, respectively, whereas their specificities were 95%, 99.6% and 99.99%, respectively; these sensitivities were unacceptably low for pharmaceutical manufacturers, whereas the specificities were acceptable. The highest sensitivity for each method, obtained by changing critical values and maintaining specificity at 95%, was 44%, 62% and 62%, respectively. When adverse events were classified into two categories, sensitivities as high as 75% for regular events and 39% for rare events were achieved with the revised BCPNN method. The critical values of the information component minus two standard deviations (IC - 2SD) index of the revised BCPNN method were greater than -0.7 for regular events and greater than -0.6 for rare events. The revised BCPNN method yielded 51% sensitivity and 89% specificity for the real dataset. CONCLUSION: A lower critical value may be needed when signal-detection methodology is applied to the spontaneous reporting databases of pharmaceutical manufacturers. For example, it is recommended that pharmaceutical manufacturers use the BCPNN method with IC - 2SD criteria of greater than -0.7 for regular events and greater than -0.6 for rare events.

AB  - Self-reported patient data has been shown to be a valuable knowledge source for post-market pharmacovigilance. In this paper we propose using the popular micro-blogging service Twitter to gather evidence about adverse drug reactions (ADRs) after firstly having identified micro-blog messages (also know as "tweets") that report first-hand experience. In order to achieve this goal we explore machine learning with data crowdsourced from laymen annotators. With the help of lay annotators recruited from CrowdFlower we manually annotated 1548 tweets containing keywords related to two kinds of drugs: SSRIs (eg. Paroxetine), and cognitive enhancers (eg. Ritalin). Our results show that inter-annotator agreement (Fleiss' kappa) for crowdsourcing ranks in moderate agreement with a pair of experienced annotators (Spearman's Rho=0.471). We utilized the gold standard annotations from CrowdFlower for automatically training a range of supervised machine learning models to recognize first-hand experience. F-Score values are reported for 6 of these techniques with the Bayesian Generalized Linear Model being the best (F-Score=0.64 and Informedness=0.43) when combined with a selected set of features obtained by using information gain criteria.

AB  - Objective To study the safety profile of dupilumab using the U. S. Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database and to mine the potential adverse event signals, so as to provide reference for rational clinical drug use. Methods The dupilumab-related adverse event records were selected by searching the FAERS database from the second quarter of 2017 to the second quarter of 2020 and standardizing dupilumab’s drug name, with the primary suspected drug as a restriction. Potential adverse event signals were mined using the disproportionality analysis, including reporting odds ratio (ROR) and information component (IC), and MedDRA 23.0 was used to systematically classify the results. Results A total of 97 205 dupilumab-related adverse event records out of 16 684 618 data records were obtained. According to the results of 2 adverse event signal mining methods, 365 adverse event signals were obtained under the restricted conditions of the lower limit of the ROR value 95% confidence interval (CI) ＞1 or the lower limit of the IC value 95% CI ＞0. Finally, 82 adverse event signals with greater clinical significance were obtained through the removal of non-adverse events and the merger of the same name, and the adverse events of dupilumab were mainly eye, skin and subcutaneous diseases, infections and infestations. The adverse event signals leading to serious adverse event outcomes mainly included eye diseases, infections and inflammations that may be caused by the drug, accelerated deterioration of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, hypersensitivity of immune system, bronchitis of respiratory system, arthralgia and systemic diseases of skeletal system, and deterioration of various reactions at the site of administration. The top 5 drugs were prednisone, cyclosporine, treprostinil, prednisolone and methotrexate among the total adverse events and serious adverse events of drug combination. Conclusion In addition to the mild and moderate shallow corneal damage and conjunctivitis, clinicians should pay attention to the more serious eye detection signals such as corneal degeneration and ulcerative keratitis. It is also recommended to conduct a medical assessment with the ophthalmologist to instruct patients on medication. Doctors need to be more vigilant in medicine for patients with original eye problems. The adverse reaction signals detected by other systems still require long-term monitoring of adverse drug reactions of real-world medications. The outcome of serious adverse events of dupilumab and the corresponding detection signals, as well as the medications in combination with the most adverse events are worthy of attention.

AB  - The WHO database contains over 2.5 million case reports, analysis of this data set is performed with the intention of signal detection. This paper presents an overview of the quantitative method used to highlight dependencies in this data set. The method Bayesian confidence propagation neural network (BCPNN) is used to highlight dependencies in the data set. The method uses Bayesian statistics implemented in a neural network architecture to analyse all reported drug adverse reaction combinations. This method is now in routine use for drug adverse reaction signal detection. Also this approach has been extended to highlight drug group effects and look for higher order dependencies in the WHO data. Quantitatively unexpectedly strong relationships in the data are highlighted relative to general reporting of suspected adverse effects; these associations are then clinically assessed.

AB  - The tree-based scan statistic is a statistical data mining tool that has been used for signal detection with a self-controlled design in vaccine safety studies. This disproportionality statistic adjusts for multiple testing in evaluation of thousands of potential adverse events. However, many drug safety questions are not well suited for self-controlled analysis. We propose a method that combines tree-based scan statistics with propensity score-matched analysis of new initiator cohorts, a robust design for investigations of drug safety. We conducted plasmode simulations to evaluate performance. In multiple realistic scenarios, tree-based scan statistics in cohorts that were propensity score matched to adjust for confounding outperformed tree-based scan statistics in unmatched cohorts. In scenarios where confounding moved point estimates away from the null, adjusted analyses recovered the prespecified type 1 error while unadjusted analyses inflated type 1 error. In scenarios where confounding moved point estimates toward the null, adjusted analyses preserved power, whereas unadjusted analyses greatly reduced power. Although complete adjustment of true confounders had the best performance, matching on a moderately mis-specified propensity score substantially improved type 1 error and power compared with no adjustment. When there was true elevation in risk of an adverse event, there were often co-occurring signals for clinically related concepts. TreeScan with propensity score matching shows promise as a method for screening and prioritization of potential adverse events. It should be followed by clinical review and safety studies specifically designed to quantify the magnitude of effect, with confounding control targeted to the outcome of interest.

AB  - Background and Objectives: Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) inhibitors are efficacious and considered generally safe in adults. However, pediatric-specific safety evidence is scarce. The aim of this study was to screen for signals of previously unknown adverse events of TNF-α inhibitors in pediatric patients. Methods: We conducted a data-mining study based on routinely collected, nationwide Danish healthcare data for 2004–2016. Using tree-based scan statistics to identify events with unexpectedly high incidence during TNF-α inhibitor use among patients with inflammatory bowel disease or juvenile idiopathic arthritis, two analyses were performed: comparison with episodes of no use and with other time periods from the same patient. Based on incident physician-assigned diagnosis codes from outpatient and inpatient visits in specialist care, we screened thousands of potential adverse events while adjusting for multiple testing. Results: We identified 1310 episodes of new TNF-α inhibitor use that met the eligibility criteria. Two signals of adverse events of TNF-α inhibitors, as compared with no use, were detected. First, there were excess events of dermatologic complications (ICD-10: L00-L99, 87 vs. 44 events, risk difference [RD] 3.3%), which have been described previously in adults and children. Second, there were excess events of psychiatric diagnosis adjustment disorders (ICD-10: F432, 33 vs. 7 events, RD 2.0%), which was likely associated with the underlying disease and its severity, rather than with the treatment. The self-controlled analysis generated no signal. Conclusions: No signals of previously unknown adverse events of TNF-α inhibitors in pediatric patients were detected. The study showed that real-world data and newly developed methods for adverse events data mining can play a particularly important role in pediatrics where pre-approval drug safety data are scarce.

AB  - Background: Reports of data mining results as an initial indication of a prospectively detected safety signal in the US Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) have been limited. In April 2010 a vaccine safety signal for febrile seizures after Fluvax® and Fluvax® Junior was identified in Australia without the aid of data mining. In order to refine Northern Hemisphere influenza vaccine safety surveillance, VAERS data mining analyses based on vaccine brand name were initiated during the 2010-2011 influenza season. Objective: We describe the strategies that led to the finding of a novel safety signal using empirical Bayesian data mining. Methods: The primary US VAERS analysis calculated an empirical Bayesian geometric mean (EBGM), which was adjusted for age group, sex and year received. A secondary age-stratified analysis calculated a separate EBGM for 11 pre-defined age subsets. These bi-weekly analyses were generated with database restrictions that separated live and inactivated vaccines as well as with the US VAERS database. A cutoff of 2.0 at the fifth percentile of the confidence interval (CI) for the EBGM, the EB05, was used to identify vaccine adverse event combinations for further evaluation. Examination of potential interactions among concomitantly administered vaccines is based on the Interaction Signal Score (INTSS), which is a relative measure of how much excess disproportionality is present in the three-dimensional combination of two vaccines and one adverse event term. An INTSS >1 indicates that the CI for the three-dimensional analysis is larger than and does not overlap with the CI from the highest two-dimensional analysis. We subsequently examined the possibility of masking by removing all 2,095 Fluzone®2010-2011 reports from the 10 December 2010 version of the VAERS database. In addition, we calculated relative reporting ratios to observe the relative contribution of adjustment and the Multi-Item Gamma Poisson Shrinker (MGPS) algorithm to EBGM values. Results: On 10 December 2010, US VAERS analyses we found an EB05 >2 for Fluzone®2010-2011 and the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA®) term "febrile seizure". MedDRA ® terminology is the medical terminology developed under the auspices of the International Conference on Harmonization of technical requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH). No other vaccine products had independent vaccine-febrile seizure combinations with an EB05 >2. Three-dimensional analyses to examine possible interactions among vaccine products concomitantly administered with Fluzone®2010-2011 yielded Interaction Signal Score values <1. Removal of all Fluzone®2010-2011 reports from the VAERS database failed to demonstrate a previously masked vaccine adverse event pair with an EB05 >2. The inactivated vaccine database restriction resulted in a 41 % reduction in background VAERS reports and a 24 % reduction in foreground VAERS reports. Conclusion: Empirical Bayesian data mining in VAERS prospectively detected the safety signal for febrile seizures after Fluzone®2010-2011 in young children. The EB05 threshold, database restrictions, adjustment and baseline data mining were strategies adopted a priori to enhance the specificity of the 2010-2011 influenza vaccine data mining analyses. A database restriction used to separate live vaccines resulted in a reduced EB05. Adjustment of data mining analyses had a larger effect on estimates of disproportionality than the MGPS algorithm. Masking did not appear to influence our findings. This case study illustrates the value of VAERS data mining for vaccine safety monitoring. © 2013 Springer International Publishing Switzerland (outside the USA).

TI  - Data mining in pharmacovigilance--detecting the unexpected: the role of index of suspicion of the reporter
AU  - Sundström, A.

AB  - BACKGROUND: One of the most important aims of pharmacovigilance is to detect signals of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) as early as possible. However, some ADRs are difficult to detect, one example being so called 'type C' reactions. These are effects that present as seemingly 'spontaneous' diseases occurring during treatment with a drug, such as the occurrence of a cardiovascular event while the patient is taking rofecoxib. As this type of ADR is often mistaken for a spontaneous disease, the causative agent may appear as an innocent bystander. OBJECTIVE: The primary aim of this study was to investigate the possibility of using data mining approaches to detect signals of 'type C' reactions. We hypothesized that by including concomitant, and not only suspected medications in the calculations of disproportionality analyses, we would be able to identify such reactions. STUDY DESIGN: We used data from the Swedish Drug Information System, SWEDIS, which contains spontaneous reports submitted by Swedish physicians to the Swedish Medical Products Agency, and applied Bayesian confidence propagation neural network (BCPNN) methodology to calculate the information component (IC) value for drug-event combinations for drugs belonging to the Anatomic Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classes cardiovascular system, musculoskeletal system and nervous system (number of reports = 51 270) where only the suspected drug was considered, and also where both concomitant and suspected drugs were considered. We then classified drug-event combinations that were signalled by a statistically significantly raised IC value as labelled or unlabelled based on the approved summary of product characteristics (SPC) in Sweden as of November 2007, and further classified them as 'type C' reactions or not 'type C'. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The proportion of 'type C' reactions signalled when considering both concomitant and suspected drugs compared with suspected drugs only. RESULTS: The proportion of labelled drug-event combinations when considering suspected drugs was 78.6%. Drug-event combinations classified as 'type C' reactions were more likely to be found when considering both concomitant and suspected drugs compared with suspected drugs only; 18/449 versus 0/248 when considering drug-event combinations that were signalled exclusively by one of the approaches. Such drug-event combinations included, for example, sudden death and celecoxib, myocardial infarction and diclofenac, suicide-related events and several antidepressants. CONCLUSION: Including both concomitant and suspected drugs in data mining practices may be a way of detecting 'type C' reactions earlier. This could constitute an advance in data mining for pharmacovigilance practices.

AB  - Background and Objective: With the rise in polypharmacy, it is increasingly important to identify drug–drug interactions (DDIs) that cause serious adverse events in a timely manner. The purpose of the study was to investigate the utility of systematic data mining of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database for interactions between statins (HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors) and other drugs that underlie a higher risk for rhabdomyolysis. Methods: The strength of association for the reporting of rhabdomyolysis with each statin–drug combination was measured using Bayesian data mining scores, the Interaction Signal Score (INTSS), and simple proportions that were calculated as the reporting odds ratio (ROR). Scores >1.0 indicate disproportionately higher than expected reporting. A manual case review highlighted strengths and limitations of these measures. Results: As expected, clarithromycin and cyclosporine produced high measures of disproportionate reporting of rhabdomyolysis with lovastatin and simvastatin. Drugs with no known predilection to contribute to statin myopathy produced scores <1.0 when paired with each statin. In contrast, in some instances INTSS values were <1.0 when measures of DDI with statin–drug pairs known to interact. This might be due to masking by high numbers of reports linked to the non-statin drug alone. The manual review identified dose as an important risk factor; however, this risk factor could not have been systematically identified without informatics enhancements. Conclusions: While disproportionality methods represent a promising tool for identifying a potential serious DDI, opportunities remain for improvements in both data mining algorithms and the acquisition of adequately informative data.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Quantitative data mining methods can be used to identify potential signals of unexpected relationships between drug and adverse event (AE). This study aims to compare and explore the use of three data mining methods in our small spontaneous AE database. METHODS: We consider reporting odds ratio (ROR), Bayesian Confidence Propagation Neural Network (BCPNN) and Gamma Poisson Shrinker (GPS) assuming two different sets of criteria: (1) ROR-1.96SE>1, IC-1.96SD>0, EB05>1 (2) ROR-1.96SE>2, IC-1.96SD>1, EB05 >2. Count of drug-AE pairs ≥3 was considered for ROR and GPS. RESULTS: The Health Sciences Authority, Singapore received 151,180 AE reports between 1993 and 2013. ROR, BCPNN and GPS identified 2,835, 2,311 and 2,374 significant drug-AE pairs using Criterion 1, and 1,899, 1,101 and 1,358 respectively using Criterion 2. The performance of the three methods with respect to specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value were similar, although ROR yielded a higher sensitivity and larger area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. ROR and GPS picked up some potential signals which BCPNN missed. CONCLUSIONS: The defined threshold used for ROR (Criterion 1) is a useful screening tool for our small database. It may be used in conjunction with GPS to avoid missed signals.

AB  - Adverse drug events (ADEs) are a public health issue. Their detection usually relies on voluntary reporting or medical chart reviews. The objective of this paper is to automatically detect cases of ADEs by data mining. 115,447 complete past hospital stays are extracted from six French, Danish, and Bulgarian hospitals using a common data model including diagnoses, drug administrations, laboratory results, and free-text records. Different kinds of outcomes are traced, and supervised rule induction methods (decision trees and association rules) are used to discover ADE detection rules, with respect to time constraints. The rules are then filtered, validated, and reorganized by a committee of experts. The rules are described in a rule repository, and several statistics are automatically computed in every medical department, such as the confidence, relative risk, and median delay of outcome appearance. 236 validated ADE-detection rules are discovered; they enable to detect 27 different kinds of outcomes. The rules use a various number of conditions related to laboratory results, diseases, drug administration, and demographics. Some rules involve innovative conditions, such as drug discontinuations.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this paper is to demonstrate the usefulness of the Bayesian Confidence Propagation Neural Network (BCPNN) in the detection of drug-specific and drug-group effects in the database of adverse drug reactions of the World Health Organization Programme for International Drug Monitoring. METHODS: Examples of drug-adverse reaction combinations highlighted by the BCPNN as quantitative associations were selected. The anatomical therapeutic chemical (ATC) group to which the drug belonged was then identified, and the information component (IC) was calculated for this ATC group and the adverse drug reaction (ADR). The IC of the ATC group with the ADR was then compared with the IC of the drug-ADR by plotting the change in IC and its 95% confidence limit over time for both. RESULTS: The chosen examples show that the BCPNN data-mining approach can identify drug-specific as well as group effects. In the known examples that served as test cases, beta-blocking agents other than practolol are not associated with sclerosing peritonitis, but all angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors are associated with coughing, as are antihistamines with heart-rhythm disorders and antipsychotics with myocarditis. The recently identified association between antipsychotics and myocarditis remains even after consideration of concomitant medication. CONCLUSION: The BCPNN can be used to improve the ability of a signal detection system to highlight group and drug-specific effects.

AB  - Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have become one of the most broadly used medications in psychiatry. Fluoxetine is the first representative antidepressant SSRI drug approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1987. Safety information on fluoxetine use alone was less reported than its combined use with other drugs. There were no published papers on adverse drug reactions (ADRs) of fluoxetine analyzing spontaneous adverse events reports. We detected signals of the adverse drug reactions of fluoxetine by data mining using the Korea Adverse Events Reporting System (KAERS) database. We defined signals in this study by the reporting odds ratios (ROR), proportional reporting ratios (PRR), and information components (IC) indices. The KAERS database included 860,224 AE reports, among which 866 reports contained fluoxetine. We compared the labels of fluoxetine among the United States, UK, Germany, France, China, and Korea. Some of the signals, including emotional lability, myositis, spinal stenosis, paradoxical drug reaction, drug dependence, extrapyramidal disorder, adrenal insufficiency, and intracranial hemorrhage, were not labeled in the six countries. In conclusion, we identified new signals that were not known at the time of market approval. However, certain factors should be required for signal evaluation, such as clinical significance, preventability, and causality of the detected signals.

AB  - Adverse drug events would be responsible from 10,000 death per year in France. Most often, detection relies on events declaration; alert and prevention rules are writen by experts thanks to cases reviews. Moreover, the medical departments' specificities are not taken into account (patients, practices, knowledge). The objectives of the PSIP European project is to use data-mining to detect those events and automatically generate control rules, department by department. Using 10,500 French and Danish stays, we obtain till now 630 rules from which 75 have been validated. The article shows an example of a decision tree and its interpretation in the field of cautions taken during vitamin K antagonists' use. Results' exploitation cannot elude contextualization.

AB  - Health surveillance is an important task to track the happenings related to human health, and one of its areas is pharmacovigilance. Pharmacovigilance tracks and monitors safe use of pharmaceutical products. Pharmacovigilance involves tracking side effects that may be caused by medicines and other health related drugs. Medical professionals have a difficult time collecting this information. It is anticipated that social media could help to collect this data and track side effects. Twitter data can be used for this task given that users post their personal health related experiences on-line. One problem with Twitter data, however, is that it contains a lot of noise. Therefore, an approach is needed to remove the noise. In this paper, several machine learning algorithms including deep neural nets are used to build classifiers that can help to detect these Personal Experience Tweets (PETs). Finally, we propose a method called the Deep Gramulator that improves results. Results of the analysis are presented and discussed.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: We sought to demonstrate the feasibility of utilizing deep learning models to extract safety signals related to the use of dietary supplements (DSs) in clinical text. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two tasks were performed in this study. For the named entity recognition (NER) task, Bi-LSTM-CRF (bidirectional long short-term memory conditional random field) and BERT (bidirectional encoder representations from transformers) models were trained and compared with CRF model as a baseline to recognize the named entities of DSs and events from clinical notes. In the relation extraction (RE) task, 2 deep learning models, including attention-based Bi-LSTM and convolutional neural network as well as a random forest model were trained to extract the relations between DSs and events, which were categorized into 3 classes: positive (ie, indication), negative (ie, adverse events), and not related. The best performed NER and RE models were further applied on clinical notes mentioning 88 DSs for discovering DSs adverse events and indications, which were compared with a DS knowledge base. RESULTS: For the NER task, deep learning models achieved a better performance than CRF, with F1 scores above 0.860. The attention-based Bi-LSTM model performed the best in the RE task, with an F1 score of 0.893. When comparing DS event pairs generated by the deep learning models with the knowledge base for DSs and event, we found both known and unknown pairs. CONCLUSIONS: Deep learning models can detect adverse events and indication of DSs in clinical notes, which hold great potential for monitoring the safety of DS use.

AB  - Adverse event detection is critical for many real-world applications including timely identification of product defects, disasters, and major socio-political incidents. In the health context, adverse drug events account for countless hospitalizations and deaths annually. Since users often begin their information seeking and reporting with online searches, examination of search query logs has emerged as an important detection channel. However, search context - including query intent and heterogeneity in user behaviors - is extremely important for extracting information from search queries, and yet the challenge of measuring and analyzing these aspects has precluded their use in prior studies. We propose DeepSAVE, a novel deep learning framework for detecting adverse events based on user search query logs. DeepSAVE uses an enriched variational autoencoder encompassing a novel query embedding and user modeling module that work in concert to address the context challenge associated with search-based detection of adverse events. Evaluation results on three large real-world event datasets show that DeepSAVE outperforms existing detection methods as well as comparison deep learning auto encoders. Ablation analysis reveals that each component of DeepSAVE significantly contributes to its overall performance. Collectively, the results demonstrate the viability of the proposed architecture for detecting adverse events from search query logs.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Social media is an important pharmacovigilance data source for adverse drug reaction (ADR) identification. Human review of social media data is infeasible due to data quantity, thus natural language processing techniques are necessary. Social media includes informal vocabulary and irregular grammar, which challenge natural language processing methods. Our objective is to develop a scalable, deep-learning approach that exceeds state-of-the-art ADR detection performance in social media. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We developed a recurrent neural network (RNN) model that labels words in an input sequence with ADR membership tags. The only input features are word-embedding vectors, which can be formed through task-independent pretraining or during ADR detection training. RESULTS: Our best-performing RNN model used pretrained word embeddings created from a large, non-domain-specific Twitter dataset. It achieved an approximate match F-measure of 0.755 for ADR identification on the dataset, compared to 0.631 for a baseline lexicon system and 0.65 for the state-of-the-art conditional random field model. Feature analysis indicated that semantic information in pretrained word embeddings boosted sensitivity and, combined with contextual awareness captured in the RNN, precision. DISCUSSION: Our model required no task-specific feature engineering, suggesting generalizability to additional sequence-labeling tasks. Learning curve analysis showed that our model reached optimal performance with fewer training examples than the other models. CONCLUSION: ADR detection performance in social media is significantly improved by using a contextually aware model and word embeddings formed from large, unlabeled datasets. The approach reduces manual data-labeling requirements and is scalable to large social media datasets.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Twitter posts are now recognized as an important source of patient-generated data, providing unique insights into population health. A fundamental step toward incorporating Twitter data in pharmacoepidemiologic research is to automatically recognize medication mentions in tweets. Given that lexical searches for medication names suffer from low recall due to misspellings or ambiguity with common words, we propose a more advanced method to recognize them. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We present Kusuri, an Ensemble Learning classifier able to identify tweets mentioning drug products and dietary supplements. Kusuri (, "medication" in Japanese) is composed of 2 modules: first, 4 different classifiers (lexicon based, spelling variant based, pattern based, and a weakly trained neural network) are applied in parallel to discover tweets potentially containing medication names; second, an ensemble of deep neural networks encoding morphological, semantic, and long-range dependencies of important words in the tweets makes the final decision. RESULTS: On a class-balanced (50-50) corpus of 15 005 tweets, Kusuri demonstrated performances close to human annotators with an F1 score of 93.7%, the best score achieved thus far on this corpus. On a corpus made of all tweets posted by 112 Twitter users (98 959 tweets, with only 0.26% mentioning medications), Kusuri obtained an F1 score of 78.8%. To the best of our knowledge, Kusuri is the first system to achieve this score on such an extremely imbalanced dataset. CONCLUSIONS: The system identifies tweets mentioning drug names with performance high enough to ensure its usefulness, and is ready to be integrated in pharmacovigilance, toxicovigilance, or more generally, public health pipelines that depend on medication name mentions.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Research on pharmacovigilance from social media data has focused on mining adverse drug events (ADEs) using annotated datasets, with publications generally focusing on 1 of 3 tasks: ADE classification, named entity recognition for identifying the span of ADE mentions, and ADE mention normalization to standardized terminologies. While the common goal of such systems is to detect ADE signals that can be used to inform public policy, it has been impeded largely by limited end-to-end solutions for large-scale analysis of social media reports for different drugs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We present a dataset for training and evaluation of ADE pipelines where the ADE distribution is closer to the average 'natural balance' with ADEs present in about 7% of the tweets. The deep learning architecture involves an ADE extraction pipeline with individual components for all 3 tasks. RESULTS: The system presented achieved state-of-the-art performance on comparable datasets and scored a classification performance of F1 = 0.63, span extraction performance of F1 = 0.44 and an end-to-end entity resolution performance of F1 = 0.34 on the presented dataset. DISCUSSION: The performance of the models continues to highlight multiple challenges when deploying pharmacovigilance systems that use social media data. We discuss the implications of such models in the downstream tasks of signal detection and suggest future enhancements. CONCLUSION: Mining ADEs from Twitter posts using a pipeline architecture requires the different components to be trained and tuned based on input data imbalance in order to ensure optimal performance on the end-to-end resolution task.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Identifying occurrences of medication side effects and adverse drug events (ADEs) is an important and challenging task because they are frequently only mentioned in clinical narrative and are not formally reported. METHODS: We developed a natural language processing (NLP) system that aims to identify mentions of symptoms and drugs in clinical notes and label the relationship between the mentions as indications or ADEs. The system leverages an existing word embeddings model with induced word clusters for dimensionality reduction. It employs a conditional random field (CRF) model for named entity recognition (NER) and a random forest model for relation extraction (RE). RESULTS: Final performance of each model was evaluated separately and then combined on a manually annotated evaluation set. The micro-averaged F1 score was 80.9% for NER, 88.1% for RE, and 61.2% for the integrated systems. Outputs from our systems were submitted to the NLP Challenges for Detecting Medication and Adverse Drug Events from Electronic Health Records (MADE 1.0) competition (Yu et al. in http://bio-nlp.org/index.php/projects/39-nlp-challenges , 2018). System performance was evaluated in three tasks (NER, RE, and complete system) with multiple teams submitting output from their systems for each task. Our RE system placed first in Task 2 of the challenge and our integrated system achieved third place in Task 3. CONCLUSION: Adding to the growing number of publications that utilize NLP to detect occurrences of ADEs, our study illustrates the benefits of employing innovative feature engineering.

AB  - As one of the most important medical field subjects, adverse drug reaction seriously affects the patient's life, health, and safety. Although many methods have been proposed, there are still plenty of important adverse drug reactions unknown, due to the complexity of the detection process. Social media, such as medical forums and social networking services, collects a large amount of drug use information from patients, and so is important for adverse drug reaction mining. However, most of the existing studies only involved a single source of data. This study automatically crawls the information published by users of the MedHelp Medical Forum. Then combining it with disease-related user posts which obtained from Twitter. We combine different word embeddings and utilize a multi-channel convolutional neural network to deal with the challenge that encountered in data representation of multiple sources, and further identify text containing adverse drug reaction information. In particular, in this process, to enable the model to take advantage of the morphological and shape information of words, we use a convolutional channel to learn the features from character-level embeddings of words. The experiment results show that the proposed method improved the representation of words and thus effectively detects adverse drug reactions from text.

AB  - Motivated by limitations of adverse drug reaction (ADR) detection in clinical trials and passive post-market drug safety surveillance systems, a number of researchers have examined social media data as a potential ADR information source. Twitter is a particularly attractive platform because it has a large, diverse user community. Two challenges faced in applying Twitter data are that ADR descriptions are infrequent relative to the overall number of user posts and human review of all posts is impractical. To address these challenges, we framed the ADR detection problem as a binary classification task, where our objective was to develop a computational method that can classify user posts, known as tweets, relative to the presence of an ADR description. We developed a convolutional neural network model (ConvNet) that processes tweets as represented by word vectors created using unsupervised learning on large datasets. The ConvNet model achieved an F1-score of 0.46 and sensitivity of 0.78 for tweet ADR classification on the test dataset, compared to 0.37 F1-score and 0.33 sensitivity obtained by two baseline support vector machine (SVM) models that incorporated word embedding, n-gram, and lexicon features. We attribute the superior ConvNet model performance to its ability to process arbitrary length inputs, which allows it to evaluate every word embedding in a given tweet and make better use of their semantic content as compared to the SVM models which require a fixed length, aggregated embedding input. The results presented demonstrate the feasibility of detection of infrequent ADR mentions in large-scale media data.

AB  - As a medicine safety issue, Drug-Drug Interaction (DDI) may become an unexpected threat for causing Adverse Drug Events (ADEs). There is a growing demand for computational methods to efficiently and effectively analyse large-scale data to detect signals of Adverse Drug-drug Interactions (ADDIs). In this paper, we aim to detect high-quality signals of ADDIs which are non-spurious and non-redundant. We propose a new method which employs the framework of Bayesian network to infer the direct associations between the target ADE and medicines, and uses domain knowledge to facilitate the learning of Bayesian network structures. To improve efficiency and avoid redundancy, we design a level-wise algorithm with pruning strategy to search for high-quality ADDI signals. We have applied the proposed method to the United States Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) data. The result shows that 54.45% of detected signals are verified as known DDIs and 10.89% were evaluated as high-quality ADDI signals, demonstrating that the proposed method could be a promising tool for ADDI signal detection.

AB  - Mining social media messages such as tweets, blogs, and Facebook posts for health and drug related information has received significant interest in pharmacovigilance research. Social media sites (e.g., Twitter), have been used for monitoring drug abuse, adverse reactions to drug usage, and analyzing expression of sentiments related to drugs. Most of these studies are based on aggregated results from a large population rather than specific sets of individuals. In order to conduct studies at an individual level or specific groups of people, identifying posts mentioning intake of medicine by the user is necessary. Toward this objective we develop a classifier for identifying mentions of personal intake of medicine in tweets. We train a stacked ensemble of shallow convolutional neural network (CNN) models on an annotated dataset. We use random search for tuning the hyper-parameters of the CNN models and present an ensemble of best models for the prediction task. Our system produces state-of-the-art results, with a micro-averaged F-score of 0.693. We believe that the developed classifier has direct uses in the areas of psychology, health informatics, pharmacovigilance, and affective computing for tracking moods, emotions, and sentiments of patients expressing intake of medicine in social media.

AB  - Multiple data sources are preferred in adverse drug event (ADEs) surveillance owing to inadequacies of single source. However, analytic methods to monitor potential ADEs after prolonged drug exposure are still lacking. In this study we propose a method aiming to screen potential ADEs by combining FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) and Electronic Medical Record (EMR). The proposed method uses natural language processing (NLP) techniques to extract treatment outcome information captured in unstructured text and adopts case-crossover design in EMR. Performances were evaluated using two ADE knowledge bases: Adverse Drug Reaction Classification System (ADReCS) and SIDER. We tested our method in ADE signal detection of conventional disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) in rheumatoid arthritis patients. Findings showed that recall greatly increased when combining FAERS with EMR compared with FAERS alone and EMR alone, especially for flexible mapping strategy. Precision (FAERS + EMR) in detecting ADEs improved using ADReCS as gold standard compared with SIDER. In addition, signals detected from EMR have considerably overlapped with signals detected from FAERS or ADE knowledge bases, implying the importance of EMR for pharmacovigilance. ADE signals detected from EMR and/or FAERS but not in existing knowledge bases provide hypothesis for future study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are common and are the underlying cause of over a million serious injuries and deaths each year. The most familiar method to detect ADRs is relying on spontaneous reports. Unfortunately, the low reporting rate of spontaneous reports is a serious limitation of pharmacovigilance. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to identify a method to detect potential ADRs of drugs automatically using a deep neural network (DNN). METHODS: We designed a DNN model that utilizes the chemical, biological, and biomedical information of drugs to detect ADRs. This model aimed to fulfill two main purposes: identifying the potential ADRs of drugs and predicting the possible ADRs of a new drug. For improving the detection performance, we distributed representations of the target drugs in a vector space to capture the drug relationships using the word-embedding approach to process substantial biomedical literature. Moreover, we built a mapping function to address new drugs that do not appear in the dataset. RESULTS: Using the drug information and the ADRs reported up to 2009, we predicted the ADRs of drugs recorded up to 2012. There were 746 drugs and 232 new drugs, which were only recorded in 2012 with 1325 ADRs. The experimental results showed that the overall performance of our model with mean average precision at top-10 achieved is 0.523 and the rea under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) score achieved is 0.844 for ADR prediction on the dataset. CONCLUSIONS: Our model is effective in identifying the potential ADRs of a drug and the possible ADRs of a new drug. Most importantly, it can detect potential ADRs irrespective of whether they have been reported in the past.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The ability to detect safety concerns from spontaneous adverse drug reaction reports in a timely and efficient manner remains important in public health. OBJECTIVE: This paper explores the behaviour of the Sequential Probability Ratio Test (SPRT) and ability to detect signals of disproportionate reporting (SDRs) in the Singapore context. METHODS: We used SPRT with a combination of two hypothesised relative risks (hRRs) of 2 and 4.1 to detect signals of both common and rare adverse events in our small database. We compared SPRT with other methods in terms of number of signals detected and whether labelled adverse drug reactions were detected or the reaction terms were considered serious. The other methods used were reporting odds ratio (ROR), Bayesian Confidence Propagation Neural Network (BCPNN) and Gamma Poisson Shrinker (GPS). RESULTS: The SPRT produced 2187 signals in common with all methods, 268 unique signals, and 70 signals in common with at least one other method, and did not produce signals in 178 cases where two other methods detected them, and there were 403 signals unique to one of the other methods. In terms of sensitivity, ROR performed better than other methods, but the SPRT method found more new signals. The performances of the methods were similar for negative predictive value and specificity. CONCLUSIONS: Using a combination of hRRs for SPRT could be a useful screening tool for regulatory agencies, and more detailed investigation of the medical utility of the system is merited.

AB  - The study aimed to compare performance between the reporting odds ratio (ROR) and the Bayesian confidence propagation neural network (BCPNN) methods in identifying serious adverse drug reactions (ADRs) using the Thai FDA spontaneous database. The two methods were retrospectively applied to identify new, serious ADRs reported with antiretroviral therapy (ART) drugs using the data set between 1990 and 2006. We plotted the ROR and the information component against time to compare the differential timing of signal detection and the pattern of signaling over time between these methods. The ROR and the BCPNN methods identified the associations between ART drugs and serious ADRs at the same time. Both methods were similar in detecting the first signal of a potential ADR. However, the pattern of signaling seems relatively different with each method. Additional analyses of different drugs, ADRs, and databases will contribute to increase understanding of methods for post-marketing surveillance using spontaneous reporting system.

AB  - Aim: Dechallenge is a response observed for the reduction or disappearance of adverse drug reactions (ADR) on withdrawal of a drug from a patient. Currently available algorithms to detect dechallenge have limitations. Hence, there is a need to compare available new methods. To detect dechallenge in Spontaneous Reporting Systems, data-mining algorithms like Naive Bayes and Improved Naive Bayes were applied for comparing the performance of the algorithms in terms of accuracy and error. Analyzing the factors of dechallenge like outcome and disease category will help medical practitioners and pharmaceutical industries to determine the reasons for dechallenge in order to take essential steps toward drug safety. Materials and Methods: Adverse drug reactions of the year 2011 and 2012 were downloaded from the United States Food and Drug Administration′s database. Results: The outcome of classification algorithms showed that Improved Naive Bayes algorithm outperformed Naive Bayes with accuracy of 90.11% and error of 9.8% in detecting the dechallenge. Conclusion: Detecting dechallenge for unknown samples are essential for proper prescription. To overcome the issues exposed by Naive Bayes algorithm, Improved Naive Bayes algorithm can be used to detect dechallenge in terms of higher accuracy and minimal error.

AB  - Background and Objective: While risk of acute kidney injury (AKI) is a well documented adverse effect of some drugs, few studies have assessed the relationship between drug–drug interactions (DDIs) and AKI. Our objective was to develop an algorithm capable of detecting potential signals on this relationship by retrospectively mining data from electronic health records. Material and methods: Data were extracted from the clinical data warehouse (CDW) of the Hôpital Européen Georges Pompidou (HEGP). AKI was defined as the first level of the RIFLE criteria, that is, an increase ≥50 % of creatinine basis. Algorithm accuracy was tested on 20 single drugs, 10 nephrotoxic and 10 non-nephrotoxic. We then tested 45 pairs of non-nephrotoxic drugs, among the most prescribed at our hospital and representing distinct pharmacological classes for DDIs. Results: Sensitivity and specificity were 50 % [95 % confidence interval (CI) 23.66–76.34] and 90 % (95 % CI 59.58–98.21), respectively, for single drugs. Our algorithm confirmed a previously identified signal concerning clarithromycin and calcium-channel blockers (unadjusted odds ratio (ORu) 2.92; 95 % CI 1.11–7.69, p = 0.04). Among the 45 drug pairs investigated, we identified a signal concerning 55 patients in association with bromazepam and hydroxyzine (ORu 1.66; 95 % CI 1.23–2.23). This signal was not confirmed after a chart review. Even so, AKI and co-prescription were confirmed for 96 % (95 % CI 88–99) and 88 % (95 % CI 76–94) of these patients, respectively. Conclusion: Data mining techniques on CDW can foster the detection of adverse drug reactions when drugs are used alone or in combination.

AB  - Substances involved in overdose deaths have shifted over time and continue to undergo transition. Early detection of emerging drugs involved in overdose is a major challenge for traditional public health data systems. While novel social media data have shown promise, there is a continued need for robust natural language processing approaches that can identify emerging substances. Consequently, we developed a new metric, the relative similarity ratio, based on diachronic word embeddings to measure movement in the semantic proximity of individual substance words to 'overdose' over time. Our analysis of 64,420,376 drug-related posts made between January 2011 and December 2018 on Reddit, the largest online forum site, reveals that this approach successfully identified fentanyl, the most significant emerging substance in the overdose epidemic, >1 year earlier than traditional public health data systems. Use of diachronic word embeddings may enable improved identification of emerging substances involved in drug overdose, thereby improving the timeliness of prevention and treatment activities.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Machine learning offers an alluring solution to developing automated approaches to the increasing individual case safety report burden being placed upon pharmacovigilance. Leveraging crowdsourcing to annotate unstructured data may provide accurate, efficient, and contemporaneous training data sets in support of machine learning. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to evaluate whether crowdsourcing can be used to accurately and efficiently develop training data sets in support of pharmacovigilance automation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Pharmacovigilance experts created a reference dataset by reviewing 15,490 de-identified social media posts of narratives pertaining to 15 drugs and 22 medically relevant topics. A random sampling of posts from the reference dataset was published on Amazon Turk and its users (Turkers) were asked a series of questions about those same medical concepts. Accuracy, price elasticity, and time efficiency were evaluated. RESULTS: Accuracy of crowdsourced curation exceeded 90% when compared to the reference dataset and was completed in about 5% of the time. There was an increase in time efficiency with higher pay, but there was no significant difference in accuracy. Additionally, having a social media post reviewed by more than one Turker (using a voting system) did not offer significant improvements in terms of accuracy. CONCLUSIONS: Crowdsourcing is an accurate and efficient method that can be used to develop training data sets in support of pharmacovigilance automation. More research is needed to better understand the breadth and depth of possible uses as well as strengths, limitations, and generalizability of results.

AB  - Background Around 20 % of all adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are due to drug interactions. Some of these will only be detected in the postmarketing setting. Effective screening in large collections of individual case safety reports (ICSRs) requires automated triages to identify signals of adverse drug interactions. Research so far has focused on statistical measures, but clinical information and pharmacological characteristics are essential in the clinical assessment and may be of great value in first-pass filtering of potential adverse drug interaction signals. Objective The aim of this study was to develop triages for adverse drug interaction surveillance, and to evaluate these prospectively relative to clinical assessment. Methods A broad set of variables were considered for inclusion in the triages, including cytochrome P450 (CYP) activity, explicit suspicions of drug interactions as noted by the reporter, dose and treatment overlap, and a measure of interaction disproportionality. Their unique contributions in predicting signals of adverse drug interactions were determined through logistic regression. This was based on the reporting in the WHO global ICSR database, VigiBase (TM), for a set of known adverse drug interactions and corresponding negative controls. Three triages were developed, each producing an estimated probability that a given drug-drug-ADR triplet constitutes an adverse drug interaction signal. The triages were evaluated against two separate benchmarks derived from expert clinical assessment: adverse drug interactions known in the literature and prospective adverse drug interaction signals. For reference, the triages were compared with disproportionality analysis alone using the same benchmarks. Results The following were identified as valuable predictors of adverse drug interaction signals: plausible CYP metabolism; notes of suspected interaction by the reporter; and reports of unexpected therapeutic response, altered therapeutic effect with dose information and altered therapeutic effect when only two drugs had been used. The new triages identified reporting patterns corresponding to both prospective signals of adverse drug interactions and already established ones. They perform better than disproportionality analysis alone relative to both benchmarks. Conclusions A range of predictors for adverse drug interaction signals have been identified. They substantially improve signal detection capacity compared with disproportionality analysis alone. The value of incorporating clinical and pharmacological information in first-pass screening is clear.

AB  - Importance Although critical to patient safety, health care-related allergic reactions are challenging to identify and monitor. Objective To develop a deep learning model to identify allergic reactions in the free-text narrative of hospital safety reports and evaluate its generalizability, efficiency, productivity, and interpretability. Design, Setting, and Participants This cross-sectional study analyzed hospital safety reports filed between May 2004 and January 2019 at Brigham and Women's Hospital and between April 2006 and June 2018 at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. Training and validating a deep learning model involved extracting safety reports using 101 expert-curated keywords from Massachusetts General Hospital (data set I). The model was then evaluated on 3 data sets: reports without keywords (data set II), reports from a different time frame (data set III), and reports from a different hospital (Brigham and Women's Hospital; data set IV). Statistical analyses were performed between March 1, 2019, and July 18, 2020. Main Outcomes and Measures The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve and area under the precision-recall curve were used on data set I. The precision at top-k was used on data sets II to IV. Results A total of 299 028 safety reports with 172 854 patients were included. Of these patients, 86 544 were women (50.1%) and the median (interquartile range [IQR]) age was 59.7 (43.8-71.6) years. The deep learning model achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.979 (95% CI, 0.973-0.985) and an area under the precision-recall curve of 0.809 (95% CI, 0.773-0.845). The model achieved precisions at the top 100 model-identified cases of 0.930 in data set II, 0.960 in data set III, and 0.990 in data set IV. Compared with the keyword-search approach, the deep learning model reduced the number of cases for manual review by 63.8% and identified 24.2% more cases of confirmed allergic reactions. The model highlighted important words (eg, rash, hives, and Benadryl) in prediction and extended the list of expert-curated keywords through an attention layer. Conclusions and Relevance This study showed that a deep learning model can accurately and efficiently identify allergic reactions using free-text narratives written by a variety of health care professionals. This model could be used to improve allergy care, potentially enabling real-time event surveillance and guidance for medical errors and system improvement. This cross-sectional study describes the development and evaluation of a deep learning model to identify allergic reaction in the free-text narrative of hospital safety reports. Question Can a deep learning model applied to the free-text narrative of hospital safety event reports identify allergic reactions? Findings In this cross-sectional study of 299 028 hospital safety reports involving 172 854 patients, a deep learning model was developed and validated on the basis of a subset of the reports and reached an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.979 for identifying allergic reactions. Compared with the keyword-search approach, the model identified 24.2% more cases of confirmed allergic reactions and reduced the need for manual review by 63.8%. Meaning Results of this study suggest that deep learning can improve the accuracy and efficiency of the allergic reaction identification process, which may facilitate future real-time patient safety surveillance and guidance for medical errors and system improvement.

AB  - A significant amount of information about drug-related safety issues such as adverse effects are published in medical case reports that can only be explored by human readers due to their unstructured nature. The work presented here aims at generating a systematically annotated corpus that can support the development and validation of methods for the automatic extraction of drug-related adverse effects from medical case reports. The documents are systematically double annotated in various rounds to ensure consistent annotations. The annotated documents are finally harmonized to generate representative consensus annotations. In order to demonstrate an example use case scenario, the corpus was employed to train and validate models for the classification of informative against the non-informative sentences. A Maximum Entropy classifier trained with simple features and evaluated by 10-fold cross-validation resulted in the F₁ score of 0.70 indicating a potential useful application of the corpus.

AB  - Many drugs commonly prescribed during pregnancy lack a fetal safety recommendation - called FDA 'category C' drugs. This study aims to classify these drugs into harmful and safe categories using knowledge gained from chemoinformatics (i.e., pharmacological similarity with drugs of known fetal effect) and empirical data (i.e., derived from Electronic Health Records). Our fetal loss cohort contains 14,922 affected and 33,043 unaffected pregnancies and our congenital anomalies cohort contains 5,658 affected and 31,240 unaffected infants. We trained a random forest to classify drugs of unknown pregnancy class into harmful or safe categories, focusing on two distinct outcomes: fetal loss and congenital anomalies. Our models achieved an out-of-bag accuracy of 91% for fetal loss and 87% for congenital anomalies outperforming null models. Fifty-seven 'category C' medications were classified as harmful for fetal loss and eleven for congenital anomalies. This includes medications with documented harmful effects, including naproxen, ibuprofen and rubella live vaccine. We also identified several novel drugs, e.g., haloperidol, that increased the risk of fetal loss. Our approach provides important information on the harmfulness of 'category C' drugs. This is needed, as no FDA recommendation exists for these drugs' fetal safety.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: As the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) receives over a million adverse event reports associated with medication use every year, a system is needed to aid FDA safety evaluators in identifying reports most likely to demonstrate causal relationships to the suspect medications. We combined text mining with machine learning to construct and evaluate such a system to identify medication-related adverse event reports. METHODS: FDA safety evaluators assessed 326 reports for medication-related causality. We engineered features from these reports and constructed random forest, L1 regularized logistic regression, and support vector machine models. We evaluated model accuracy and further assessed utility by generating report rankings that represented a prioritized report review process. RESULTS: Our random forest model showed the best performance in report ranking and accuracy, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.66. The generated report ordering assigns reports with a higher probability of medication-related causality a higher rank and is significantly correlated to a perfect report ordering, with a Kendall's tau of 0.24 ( P  = .002). CONCLUSION: Our models produced prioritized report orderings that enable FDA safety evaluators to focus on reports that are more likely to contain valuable medication-related adverse event information. Applying our models to all FDA adverse event reports has the potential to streamline the manual review process and greatly reduce reviewer workload.

AB  - The use of multiple data sources has been preferred in the surveillance of adverse drug events due to shortcomings of using only a single source. In this study, we proposed a framework where the ADEs associated with interested drugs are systematically discovered from the FDA's Adverse Event Reporting System (AERS), and then validated through mining unstructured clinical notes from Electronic Medical Records (EMRs). This framework has two features. First, a higher priority was given to clinical practice during signal detection and validation. Second, the normalization by NLP facilitated the interoperation between AERS-DM and the EMR. To demonstrate this methodology, we investigated potential ADEs associated with drugs (class level) for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients. The results demonstrated the feasibility and sufficient accuracy of the framework. The framework can serve as the interface between the informatics domain and the medical domain to facilitate ADE discovery.

AB  - Data mining disproportionality methods (PRR, ROR, EBGM, IC, etc.) are commonly used to identify drug safety signals in spontaneous report system (SRS) databases. Newer data sources such as longitudinal observational databases (LOD) provide time-stamped patient-level information and overcome some of the SRS limitations such as an absence of the denominator, total number of patients who consume a drug, and limited temporal information. Application of the disproportionality methods to LODs has not been widely explored. The scale of the LOD data provides an interesting computational challenge. Larger health claims databases contain information on more than 50 million patients and each patient has records for up to 10 years. In this article we systematically explore the application of commonly used disproportionality methods to simulated and real LOD data. © 2011 The Author(s).

PD  - 
AB  - Background: The antithyroid drugs propylthiouracil and methimazole were introduced for clinical use about 60 yr ago and are estimated to be used in more than 6000 children and adolescents per year in the United States. Over the years that these medications have been used, reports of adverse events involving hepatotoxicity have appeared. To date, there has not been a systematic and comparative evaluation of the adverse events associated with antithyroid drug use. Objective: Our objective was to assess safety and hepatotoxicity profiles of propylthiouracil and methimazole by age in the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's Adverse Event Reporting System (AERS). Design: We used the multi-item gamma-Poisson shrinker (MGPS) data mining algorithm to analyze more than 40 yr of safety data in AERS. MGPS uses a Bayesian model to calculate adjusted observed to expected ratios [empiric Bayes geometric mean (EBGM) values] for every drug-adverse event combination in AERS, focusing on hepatotoxicity events. Results: MGPS identified higher-than-expected reporting of severe liver injury in pediatric patients treated with propylthiouracil but not with methimazole. Propylthiouracil had a high adjusted reporting ratio for severe liver injury (EBGM 17; 90% confidence interval = 11.5-24.1) in the group less than 17 yr old. The highest EBGM values for methimazole were with mild liver injury in the group 61 yr and older [EBGM 4.8 (3.3-6.8)], which consisted of cholestasis. Vasculitis was also observed for propylthiouracil in children and adolescents, reaching higher EBGM values than hepatotoxicity signals. Conclusions: MGPS detects higher-than-expected reporting of severe hepatotoxicity and vasculitis in children and adolescents with propylthiouracil but not with methimazole.

AB  - Information extraction and knowledge discovery regarding adverse drug reaction (ADR) from large-scale clinical texts are very useful and needy processes. Two major difficulties of this task are the lack of domain experts for labeling examples and intractable processing of unstructured clinical texts. Even though most previous works have been conducted on these issues by applying semisupervised learning for the former and a word-based approach for the latter, they face with complexity in an acquisition of initial labeled data and ignorance of structured sequence of natural language. In this study, we propose automatic data labeling by distant supervision where knowledge bases are exploited to assign an entity-level relation label for each drug-event pair in texts, and then, we use patterns for characterizing ADR relation. The multiple-instance learning with expectation-maximization method is employed to estimate model parameters. The method applies transductive learning to iteratively reassign a probability of unknown drug-event pair at the training time. By investigating experiments with 50,998 discharge summaries, we evaluate our method by varying large number of parameters, that is, pattern types, pattern-weighting models, and initial and iterative weightings of relations for unlabeled data. Based on evaluations, our proposed method outperforms the word-based feature for NB-EM (iEM), MILR, and TSVM with F1 score of 11.3%, 9.3%, and 6.5% improvement, respectively.

AB  - Discovering unknown adverse drug reactions (ADRs) in postmarketing surveillance as early as possible is of great importance. The current approach to postmarketing surveillance primarily relies on spontaneous reporting. It is a passive surveillance system and limited by gross underreporting (<10% reporting rate), latency, and inconsistent reporting. We propose a novel team-based intelligent agent software system approach for proactively monitoring and detecting potential ADRs of interest using electronic patient records. We designed such a system and named it ADRMonitor. The intelligent agents, operating on computers located in different places, are capable of continuously and autonomously collaborating with each other and assisting the human users (e.g., the food and drug administration (FDA), drug safety professionals, and physicians). The agents should enhance current systems and accelerate early ADR identification. To evaluate the performance of the ADRMonitor with respect to the current spontaneous reporting approach, we conducted simulation experiments on identification of ADR signal pairs (i.e., potential links between drugs and apparent adverse reactions) under various conditions. The experiments involved over 275,000 simulated patients created on the basis of more than 1000 real patients treated by the drug cisapride that was on the market for seven years until its withdrawal by the FDA in 2000 due to serious ADRs. Healthcare professionals utilizing the spontaneous reporting approach and the ADRMonitor were separately simulated by decision-making models derived from a general cognitive decision model called fuzzy recognition-primed decision (RPD) model that we recently developed. The quantitative simulation results show that 1) the number of true ADR signal pairs detected by the ADRMonitor is 6.6 times higher than that by the spontaneous reporting strategy; 2) the ADR detection rate of the ADRMonitor agents with even moderate decision-making skills is five times higher than that of spontaneous reporting; and 3) as the number of patient cases increases, ADRs could be detected significantly earlier by the ADRMonitor.

AB  - This paper proposes a research method of adverse drug reactions based on attention mechanism and fusion of emotional information, and constructs a neural network model, Attention based Convolutional neural networks and Bi-directional long short-Term Memory (ACB). In order to improve the recognition efficiency of adverse drug reactions and solve the problems of gradient explosion and disappearance, it introduced the attention mechanism and Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) to enhance the reliability of the model, as well as mixed together the emotional information of the users' medication comments. Compared with the superficial information only relied on users' medication reviews, this is able to enhance features' expression way and the accuracy of the adverse drug reaction's classifications. This experiment dataset was based on the local drugs in Xinjiang. The best performance on a test dataset was with ACB obtaining a precision of 95.12% and a recall of 98.48%, and an F-score of 96.77%. The results showed that the ACB model can significantly improve the recognition and classification performance of adverse drug reactions.

AB  - Purpose: In post-marketing drug safety surveillance, data mining can potentially detect rare but serious adverse events. Assessing an entire collection of drug-event pairs is traditionally performed on a predefined level of granularity. It is unknown a priori whether a drug causes a very specific or a set of related adverse events, such as mitral valve disorders, all valve disorders, or different types of heart disease. This methodological paper evaluates the tree-based scan statistic data mining method to enhance drug safety surveillance. Methods: We use a three-million-member electronic health records database from the HMO Research Network. Using the tree-based scan statistic, we assess the safety of selected antifungal and diabetes drugs, simultaneously evaluating overlapping diagnosis groups at different granularity levels, adjusting for multiple testing. Expected and observed adverse event counts were adjusted for age, sex, and health plan, producing a log likelihood ratio test statistic. Results: Out of 732 evaluated disease groupings, 24 were statistically significant, divided among 10 non-overlapping disease categories. Five of the 10 signals are known adverse effects, four are likely due to confounding by indication, while one may warrant further investigation. Conclusion: The tree-based scan statistic can be successfully applied as a data mining tool in drug safety surveillance using observational data. The total number of statistical signals was modest and does not imply a causal relationship. Rather, data mining results should be used to generate candidate drug-event pairs for rigorous epidemiological studies to evaluate the individual and comparative safety profiles of drugs. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To extract physician-asserted drug side effects from electronic medical record clinical narratives. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Pattern matching rules were manually developed through examining keywords and expression patterns of side effects to discover an individual side effect and causative drug relationship. A combination of machine learning (C4.5) using side effect keyword features and pattern matching rules was used to extract sentences that contain side effect and causative drug pairs, enabling the system to discover most side effect occurrences. Our system was implemented as a module within the clinical Text Analysis and Knowledge Extraction System. RESULTS: The system was tested in the domain of psychiatry and psychology. The rule-based system extracting side effects and causative drugs produced an F score of 0.80 (0.55 excluding allergy section). The hybrid system identifying side effect sentences had an F score of 0.75 (0.56 excluding allergy section) but covered more side effect and causative drug pairs than individual side effect extraction. DISCUSSION: The rule-based system was able to identify most side effects expressed by clear indication words. More sophisticated semantic processing is required to handle complex side effect descriptions in the narrative. We demonstrated that our system can be trained to identify sentences with complex side effect descriptions that can be submitted to a human expert for further abstraction. CONCLUSION: Our system was able to extract most physician-asserted drug side effects. It can be used in either an automated mode for side effect extraction or semi-automated mode to identify side effect sentences that can significantly simplify abstraction by a human expert.

AB  - Adverse drug events (ADEs) create a serious problem causing substantial harm to patients. An executable standardized knowledgebase of drug-ADE relations which is publicly available would be valuable so that it could be used for ADE detection. The literature is an important source that could be used to generate a knowledgebase of drug-ADE pairs. In this paper, we report on a method that automatically determines whether a specific adverse event (AE) is caused by a specific drug based on the content of PubMed citations. A drug-ADE classification method was initially developed to detect neutropenia based on a pre-selected set of drugs. This method was then applied to a different set of 76 drugs to determine if they caused neutropenia. For further proof of concept this method was applied to 48 drugs to determine whether they caused another AE, myocardial infarction. Results showed that AUROC was 0.93 and 0.86 respectively.

AB  - Background: Drug-induced gingival hyperplasia (DIGH) causes problems with chewing, aesthetics, and pronunciation, and leads to the deterioration of the patient's quality of life (QOL). Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate the incidence of DIGH using spontaneous reporting system (SRS) databases. Methods: We analyzed reports of DIGH from SRS databases and calculated the reporting odds ratios (RORs) of suspected drugs (immunosuppressants, calcium channel blockers, and anticonvulsants). The SRS databases used were the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) and the Japanese Adverse Drug Event Report (JADER) database. With the data, we evaluated the time-to-onset profile and the hazard type using the Weibull shape parameter (WSP). Furthermore, we used the association rule mining technique to discover undetected relationships such as possible risk factors. Results: The FAERS contained 5,821,716 reports. The RORs (95% confidence interval: CI) for cyclosporine, everolimus, sirolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, amlodipine, nifedipine, carbamazepine, clobazam, levetiracetam, phenobarbital, phenytoin, primidone, topiramate, and valproic acid, were 39.4 (95% CI: 30.3-51.2), 4.2 (1.7-10.0), 6.6 (2.5-17.7), 13.1 (7.2-23.2), 94.8 (80.0-112.9), 57.9 (35.7-94.0), 15.1 (10.3-22.3), 65.4 (33.8-126.7), 6.5 (3.6-11.8), 19.7 (8.8-44.0), 65.4 (52.4-82.9), 56.5 (21.1-151.7), 2.9 (1.1-7.7), and 17.5 (12.6-24.4), respectively. The JADER database contained 430,587 reports. The median time-to-onset of gingival hyperplasia values for immunosuppressants, calcium channel blockers, and anticonvulsants use were 71, 262, and 37 days, respectively. Furthermore, the 95% CI of the WSP β for anticonvulsants was over and excluded 1, which meant that they were wear-out failure type. Conclusions: Our results suggest that DIGH monitoring of patients administered immunosuppressants, calcium channel blockers, or anticonvulsants is important. We demonstrated the potential risk of DIGH following the long-term use of calcium channel blocker over approximately 260 days. Based on the results of the association rule mining approach, patients with intellectual disability who are administered phenytoin should be monitored carefully. We recommend that patients who experience symptoms related to DIGH should be closely monitored.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) occur in nearly all patients on chemotherapy, causing morbidity and therapy disruptions. Detection of such ADRs is limited in clinical trials, which are underpowered to detect rare events. Early recognition of ADRs in the postmarketing phase could substantially reduce morbidity and decrease societal costs. Internet community health forums provide a mechanism for individuals to discuss real-time health concerns and can enable computational detection of ADRs. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study is to identify cutaneous ADR signals in social health networks and compare the frequency and timing of these ADRs to clinical reports in the literature. METHODS: We present a natural language processing-based, ADR signal-generation pipeline based on patient posts on Internet social health networks. We identified user posts from the Inspire health forums related to two chemotherapy classes: erlotinib, an epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitor, and nivolumab and pembrolizumab, immune checkpoint inhibitors. We extracted mentions of ADRs from unstructured content of patient posts. We then performed population-level association analyses and time-to-detection analyses. RESULTS: Our system detected cutaneous ADRs from patient reports with high precision (0.90) and at frequencies comparable to those documented in the literature but an average of 7 months ahead of their literature reporting. Known ADRs were associated with higher proportional reporting ratios compared to negative controls, demonstrating the robustness of our analyses. Our named entity recognition system achieved a 0.738 microaveraged F-measure in detecting ADR entities, not limited to cutaneous ADRs, in health forum posts. Additionally, we discovered the novel ADR of hypohidrosis reported by 23 patients in erlotinib-related posts; this ADR was absent from 15 years of literature on this medication and we recently reported the finding in a clinical oncology journal. CONCLUSIONS: Several hundred million patients report health concerns in social health networks, yet this information is markedly underutilized for pharmacosurveillance. We demonstrated the ability of a natural language processing-based signal-generation pipeline to accurately detect patient reports of ADRs months in advance of literature reporting and the robustness of statistical analyses to validate system detections. Our findings suggest the important contributions that social health network data can play in contributing to more comprehensive and timely pharmacovigilance.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Improving the detection of drug safety signals has led several pharmacovigilance regulatory agencies to incorporate automated quantitative methods into their spontaneous reporting management systems. The three largest worldwide pharmacovigilance databases are routinely screened by the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval of proportional reporting ratio (PRR₀₂.₅), the 2.5% quantile of the Information Component (IC₀₂.₅) or the 5% quantile of the Gamma Poisson Shrinker (GPS₀₅). More recently, Bayesian and non-Bayesian False Discovery Rate (FDR)-based methods were proposed that address the arbitrariness of thresholds and allow for a built-in estimate of the FDR. These methods were also shown through simulation studies to be interesting alternatives to the currently used methods. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this work was twofold. Based on an extensive retrospective study, we compared PRR₀₂.₅, GPS₀₅ and IC₀₂.₅ with two FDR-based methods derived from the Fisher's exact test and the GPS model (GPS(pH0) [posterior probability of the null hypothesis H₀ calculated from the Gamma Poisson Shrinker model]). Secondly, restricting the analysis to GPS(pH0), we aimed to evaluate the added value of using automated signal detection tools compared with 'traditional' methods, i.e. non-automated surveillance operated by pharmacovigilance experts. METHODS: The analysis was performed sequentially, i.e. every month, and retrospectively on the whole French pharmacovigilance database over the period 1 January 1996-1 July 2002. Evaluation was based on a list of 243 reference signals (RSs) corresponding to investigations launched by the French Pharmacovigilance Technical Committee (PhVTC) during the same period. The comparison of detection methods was made on the basis of the number of RSs detected as well as the time to detection. RESULTS: Results comparing the five automated quantitative methods were in favour of GPS(pH0) in terms of both number of detections of true signals and time to detection. Additionally, based on an FDR threshold of 5%, GPS(pH0) detected 87% of the RSs associated with more than three reports, anticipating the date of investigation by the PhVTC by 15.8 months on average. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that as soon as there is reasonable support for the data, automated signal detection tools are powerful tools to explore large spontaneous reporting system databases and detect relevant signals quickly compared with traditional pharmacovigilance methods.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The use of a statistical approach to analyze cumulative adverse event (AE) reports has been encouraged by regulatory authorities. However, data variations affect statistical analyses (eg, signal detection). Further, differences in regulations, social issues, and health care systems can cause variations in AE data. The present study examined similarities and differences between two publicly available databases, ie, the Japanese Adverse Drug Event Report (JADER) database and the US Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS), and how they affect signal detection. METHODS: Two AE data sources from 2010 were examined, ie, JADER cases (JP) and Japanese cases extracted from the FAERS (FAERS-JP). Three methods for signals of disproportionate reporting, ie, the reporting odds ratio, Bayesian confidence propagation neural network, and Gamma Poisson Shrinker (GPS), were used on drug-event combinations for three substances frequently recorded in both systems. RESULTS: The two databases showed similar elements of AE reports, but no option was provided for a shareable case identifier. The average number of AEs per case was 1.6±1.3 (maximum 37) in the JP and 3.3±3.5 (maximum 62) in the FAERS-JP. Between 5% and 57% of all AEs were signaled by three quantitative methods for etanercept, infliximab, and paroxetine. Signals identified by GPS for the JP and FAERS-JP, as referenced by Japanese labeling, showed higher positive sensitivity than was expected. CONCLUSION: The FAERS-JP was different from the JADER. Signals derived from both datasets identified different results, but shared certain signals. Discrepancies in type of AEs, drugs reported, and average number of AEs per case were potential contributing factors. This study will help those concerned with pharmacovigilance better understand the use and pitfalls of using spontaneous AE data.

AB  - Objective: To investigate the efficacy and safety of dydrogesterone and progesterone in the treatment of threatened miscarriage due to corpus luteum insufficiency. Methods: A prospective cohort study was designed and a total of 1,285 patients with threatened miscarriage due to corpus luteum insufficiency were recruited, in which 665 participants received dydrogesterone treatment (dydrogesterone group), and the other 620 received progesterone treatment (progesterone group). The time for clinical symptom relief, changes of sex hormone levels in serum, the rate of miscarriage prevention, delivery outcome, and adverse effects were compared between the two groups. XGBoost algorithm was applied to analyze the factors impacting the efficacy and safety of each treatment. Results: There was no significant difference regarding the time for clinical symptom relief and the rate of miscarriage prevention between the two groups (P0.05, RR=1.01, 95% CI: 0.97-1.06, P=0.566). However, after 4 weeks of treatment, compared with the progesterone group, the level of sex hormones was significantly upregulated, while the preterm birth rate (9.65% vs. 14.04%), the postpartum hemorrhage rate (3.10% vs. 5.62%), and the incidence of adverse effects (17.44% vs. 32.58%) were considerably reduced in the dydrogesterone group (all P0.05). XGBoost algorithm analysis demonstrated that dydrogesterone treatment was correlated with a lower incidence of preterm birth rate, postpartum hemorrhage, and adverse effects, ranking the 3rd, 2nd and 1st, respectively, in the weight of dependent variables. Conclusion: Compared with progesterone, dydrogesterone can improve the delivery outcome and demonstrate a higher safety in the treatment of threatened miscarriage due to corpus luteum insufficiency.

AB  - Discovering more time-effective and a wider range of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) from social texts related to feelings concerning taking medication has recently received significant interest in pharmacovigilance research. Recognizing the posts that include ADRs is an important step for detecting ADRs from social texts. The existing systems show the unsatisfactory performance due to the insufficient expression of emotions and the inadequacy of information expression in short social texts. Although these systems exploit emotional features to improve the performance of their methods, the representation of word-level emotional scores is insufficient for emotional expression. Moreover, most of the systems make less use of medical knowledge to enhance the detection of the potential relationship between drugs and adverse reactions in posts. Therefore, enough expression of emotion and medical knowledge in sparse medical social texts may be explored to improve system performance. This paper proposed an effective method integrating sufficient emotional expression and medical knowledge to detect ADRs from medical tweets. First, the proposed method utilized sentence-level emotional context and word-level emotional score to learn sufficient emotional information for distinguishing between ADR and non-ADR tweets. Furthermore, a co-occurrence dictionary of each drug and its relevant ADRs was constructed by means of a medical resource (MedDRA) and drug site (<uri>https://www.drug.com</uri>) to help the proposed model focus on posts containing drugs and ADRs. Finally, a convolutional neural network (CNN) model on the basis of bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) performed the classification task. The proposed model achieved better overall performance than the other existing methods on two Twitter datasets (F1-scores of 72.64 & x0025; and 64.98 & x0025; on PSB2016 and SMM4H, respectively).

AB  - Background: Vaccines are administered differentially according to age and sex, and disease patterns also vary among people of different age and sex groups. Estimates of disproportionality should be calculated based on comparisons of groups that have a similar likelihood of receiving similar vaccines and experiencing similar adverse events, to prevent false disproportionality from occurring. Stratified empirical Bayesian (EB) methods have been compared with crude, but not stratified, proportional reporting ratios (PRRs) in their performance on adverse event data. Objectives: (i) to implement stratification of PRR; (ii) to quantify and compare vaccine-event pairs that are highlighted by PRR and EB05 (the lower bound of the 90% CI of the EB geometric mean), for both crude and stratified; and (iii) to evaluate the effects of stratification by age and sex, in identifying adverse events that are accepted to be caused by vaccines. Methods: We applied EB and PRR data mining methods to data from the US Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). We stratified PRR and EB05 by age and sex. To study the effects of stratification, we compared the crude PRR and stratified PRR. We also assessed the crude EB05 and stratified EB05, and then compared the effects of stratification on EB05 and PRR. Results: Stratification not only changed the number of vaccine-event pairs that were highlighted, but also changed which pairs were highlighted. There were 283 vaccine-event pairs that were highlighted by the crude EB05, but not the stratified; 12 that were highlighted by the stratified EB05, but not the crude; and 162 that were highlighted by both. Similarly, there were 701 vaccine-event pairs that were highlighted by the crude PRR, but not the stratified; 139 that were highlighted by the stratified PRR, but not the crude; and 895 that were highlighted by both. There were 1466 vaccine-event pairs in which the effect of stratification was different for EB05 and PRR. Conclusion: To our knowledge, this is the first published analysis using stratified PRRs. In this analysis of passive surveillance data, stratification revealed and reduced confounding in EB and PRR, and also unmasked some vaccine-event pairs that the crude values did not highlight. Stratification should be applied if confounding is suspected. By decreasing the total number of highlighted vaccine-event pairs, stratification is likely to increase efficiency and therefore might reduce workload. © 2008 Adis Data Information BV.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Adverse event (AE) under-reporting has been a recurrent issue raised during health authorities Good Clinical Practices (GCP) inspections and audits. Moreover, safety under-reporting poses a risk to patient safety and data integrity. The current clinical Quality Assurance (QA) practices used to detect AE under-reporting rely heavily on investigator site and study audits. Yet several sponsors and institutions have had repeated findings related to safety reporting, and this has led to delays in regulatory submissions. Recent developments in data management and IT systems allow data scientists to apply techniques such as machine learning to detect AE under-reporting in an automated fashion. OBJECTIVE: In this project, we developed a predictive model that enables Roche/Genentech Quality Program Leads oversight of AE reporting at the program, study, site, and patient level. This project was part of a broader effort at Roche/Genentech Product Development Quality to apply advanced analytics to augment and complement traditional clinical QA approaches. METHOD: We used a curated data set from 104 completed Roche/Genentech sponsored clinical studies to train a machine learning model to predict the expected number of AEs. Our final model used 54 features built on patient (e.g., demographics, vitals) and study attributes (e.g., molecule class, disease area). RESULTS: In order to evaluate model performance, we tested how well it would detect simulated test cases based on data not used for model training. For relevant simulation scenarios of 25%, 50%, and 75% under-reporting on the site level, our model scored an area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of 0.62, 0.79, and 0.92, respectively. CONCLUSION: The model has been deployed to evaluate safety reporting performance in a set of ongoing studies in the form of a QA/dashboard cockpit available to Roche Quality Program Leads. Applicability and production performance will be assessed over the next 12-24 months in which we will develop a validation strategy to fully integrate our model into Roche QA processes.

AB  - Adverse Drug Reaction (ADR) extraction is the process of identifying drug implications mentioned in social posts. Handling medical text for the identification of ADR is vital to research in terms of configuring the side effect and other medical-related entities within any medical text. However, investigating the role of such effect in the context of positive and negative is the responsibility of sentiment classification task where every medical review document would be categorized into its polarity, this is known as Medical Sentiment Analysis (MSA). Several studies have presented various techniques for MSA. Most of the recent studies have concentrated on architectures such as the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to get the document embedding. Yet, such architecture focuses only on the input without considering the previous or latter input. This might lead to weaker embedding for the document where some terms would not be considered. Hence, this paper proposes a new document embedding approach based on the Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to improve the sentiment classification. Using a benchmark dataset of medical sentiments, the proposed method showed greater performance of sentiment classification accuracy. Such finding proves the effectiveness of RNN in producing document embedding.

AB  - Background: Adverse drug events (ADEs) detection and assessment is at the center of pharmacovigilance. Data mining of systems, such as FDA's Adverse Event Reporting System (AERS) and more recently, Electronic Health Records (EHRs), can aid in the automatic detection and analysis of ADEs. Although different data mining approaches have been shown to be valuable, it is still crucial to improve the quality of the generated signals. Objective: To leverage structural similarity by developing molecular fingerprint-based models (MFBMs) to strengthen ADE signals generated from EHR data. Methods: A reference standard of drugs known to be causally associated with the adverse event pancreatitis was used to create a MFBM. Electronic Health Records (EHRs) from the New York Presbyterian Hospital were mined to generate structured data. Disproportionality Analysis (DPA) was applied to the data, and 278 possible signals related to the ADE pancreatitis were detected. Candidate drugs associated with these signals were then assessed using the MFBM to find the most promising candidates based on structural similarity. Results: The use of MFBM as a means to strengthen or prioritize signals generated from the EHR significantly improved the detection accuracy of ADEs related to pancreatitis. MFBM also highlights the etiology of the ADE by identifying structurally similar drugs, which could follow a similar mechanism of action. Conclusion: The method proposed in this paper provides evidence of being a promising adjunct to existing automated ADE detection and analysis approaches. © 2012 Vilar et al.

AB  - Everyday patients’ narratives on social media can reveal crucial public health issues. Mining those online narratives, which remained so far unconsidered, may mirror further hidden patient health status. Deep learning-based sentiment analysis (SA) approaches broadly focus on grammar directions such as semantic direction or only center on extract sentiment words. They provide both richer representation capabilities and better performance but do not consider the related medication concepts. As a result, the inaccurate recognition of related drug entities may seriously fail to retrieve the relevant sentiment expressed, leading to a lower recall than desired. Thus, the frequent use of informal medical language, non-standard format, wrongly spelled, and abbreviation forms, as well as typos in social media messages, has to be taken into consideration. In other words, the core of efficiently quantifying the sentimental aspects for related medication texts hardly involves a degree of medical language comprehension. In this paper, we seek to improve the importance of considering related drug entities that keep appearing in new Unicode Versions, ranging from drugs’ names, disease symptoms, drug misuse to potentially adverse effects. We propose N-gram-based convolution vocabulary scheme, which is dedicated mainly to featuring text under medical setting and clarifying related sentiment at the same level. This vectorization results in highly sentiment extraction, which produces medical concept normalization under distributed dependency. This architecture’s layers are a shared neural network between the medical featuring channel and the bidirectional sentiment information detector channel. Fewer approaches are proposed in this matter, we evaluate the effectiveness and transferability of this study across five benchmarking datasets and various online medication-related posts (Twitter posts, Parkinson’s disease forum’s discussions), which were significantly better than all other baselines.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Accurate and complete information about medications and related information is crucial for effective clinical decision support and precise health care. Recognition and reduction of adverse drug events is also central to effective patient care. The goal of this research is the development of a natural language processing (NLP) system to automatically extract medication and adverse drug event information from electronic health records. This effort was part of the 2018 n2c2 shared task on adverse drug events and medication extraction. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The new NLP system implements a stacked generalization based on a search-based structured prediction algorithm for concept extraction. We trained 4 sequential classifiers using a variety of structured learning algorithms. To enhance accuracy, we created a stacked ensemble consisting of these concept extraction models trained on the shared task training data. We implemented a support vector machine model to identify related concepts. RESULTS: Experiments with the official test set showed that our stacked ensemble achieved an F1 score of 92.66%. The relation extraction model with given concepts reached a 93.59% F1 score. Our end-to-end system yielded overall micro-averaged recall, precision, and F1 score of 92.52%, 81.88% and 86.88%, respectively. Our NLP system for adverse drug events and medication extraction ranked within the top 5 of teams participating in the challenge. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that a stacked ensemble with a search-based structured prediction algorithm achieved good performance by effectively integrating the output of individual classifiers and could provide a valid solution for other clinical concept extraction tasks.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This article describes an ensembling system to automatically extract adverse drug events and drug related entities from clinical narratives, which was developed for the 2018 n2c2 Shared Task Track 2. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We designed a neural model to tackle both nested (entities embedded in other entities) and polysemous entities (entities annotated with multiple semantic types) based on MIMIC III discharge summaries. To better represent rare and unknown words in entities, we further tokenized the MIMIC III data set by splitting the words into finer-grained subwords. We finally combined all the models to boost the performance. Additionally, we implemented a featured-based conditional random field model and created an ensemble to combine its predictions with those of the neural model. RESULTS: Our method achieved 92.78% lenient micro F1-score, with 95.99% lenient precision, and 89.79% lenient recall, respectively. Experimental results showed that combining the predictions of either multiple models, or of a single model with different settings can improve performance. DISCUSSION: Analysis of the development set showed that our neural models can detect more informative text regions than feature-based conditional random field models. Furthermore, most entity types significantly benefit from subword representation, which also allows us to extract sparse entities, especially nested entities. CONCLUSION: The overall results have demonstrated that the ensemble method can accurately recognize entities, including nested and polysemous entities. Additionally, our method can recognize sparse entities by reconsidering the clinical narratives at a finer-grained subword level, rather than at the word level.

AB  - An experimental work on the analysis of effectiveness of neural network models applied to the classification of adverse drug reactions at the entity level is described. Aspect-level sentiment analysis, which aims to determine the sentimental class of a specific aspect conveyed in user opinions, has been actively studied for more than 10 years. A number of neural network architectures have been proposed. Even though the models based on these architectures have much in common, they differ in certain components. In this paper, the applicability of the neural network models developed for the aspect-level sentiment analysis to the problem of the classification of adverse drug reactions is studied. Extensive experiments on English language texts of biomedical topic, including health records, scientific literature, and social media have been conducted. The proposed models mentioned above are compared with one of the best model based on the support vector machine method and a large set of features.

AB  - Background: Since the last review of vaccine safety surveillance data for erythema multiforme (EM), Stevens Johnson syndrome (SJS), SJS/TEN, and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) (EM/SJS/TEN), over 37 new vaccines have been introduced in the United States. We sought to describe reported EM/SJS/TEN after vaccines during 1999–2017. Methods: We identified U.S. reports of EM/SJS/TEN received by the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) during 1999–2017. We stratified analysis by condition (EM, SJS, or TEN), and analyzed reports by serious or non-serious status, sex, age group, time from vaccination to symptom onset, exposure to known causes of EM/SJS/TEN, and vaccines administered. We used Empirical Bayesian data mining to detect vaccine-AE pairs reported more frequently than expected. Results: Of 466,027 reports to VAERS during 1999–2017, we identified 984 reports of EM, 89 reports of SJS, 6 reports of SJS/TEN, and 7 reports of TEN. Few reports of EM (9%), and most reports of SJS (52%), SJS/TEN (100%), and TEN (100%) were serious. Overall, 55% of reports described males, 48% described children aged < 4 years; 58% of EM/SJS/TEN occurred ≤ 7 days after vaccination. Few reports (≤5%) described exposure to known causes of EM/SJS/TEN. Overall, childhood vaccines (e.g., combined measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine) were most commonly reported. We identified 6 deaths; 4 were exposed to medications associated with EM/SJS/TEN. EM after smallpox vaccine was reported disproportionately among people aged 19–49 years. Conclusions: EM/SJS/TEN were rarely reported after vaccination; data mining identified a known association between EM and smallpox vaccine.

AB  - This work aims to estimate the degree of adverse drug reactions (ADR) for psychiatric medications from social media, including Twitter, Reddit, and LiveJournal. Advances in lightning-fast cluster computing was employed to process large scale data, consisting of 6.4 terabytes of data containing 3.8 billion records from all the media. Rates of ADR were quantified using the SIDER database of drugs and side-effects, and an estimated ADR rate was based on the prevalence of discussion in the social media corpora. Agreement between these measures for a sample of ten popular psychiatric drugs was evaluated using the Pearson correlation coefficient, r, with values between 0.08 and 0.50. Word2vec, a novel neural learning framework, was utilized to improve the coverage of variants of ADR terms in the unstructured text by identifying syntactically or semantically similar terms. Improved correlation coefficients, between 0.29 and 0.59, demonstrates the capability of advanced techniques in machine learning to aid in the discovery of meaningful patterns from medical data, and social media data, at scale.

AB  - Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) pose health threats to humans. Therefore, the risk re-evaluation of post-marketing drugs has become an important part of the pharmacovigilance work of various countries. In China, drugs are mainly divided into three categories, from high-risk to low-risk drugs, namely, prescription drugs (Rx), over-the-counter drugs A (OTC-A), and over-the-counter drugs B (OTC-B). Until now, there has been a lack of automated evaluation methods for the three status switch of drugs. Based on China Food and Drug Administration's (CFDA) spontaneous reporting database (CSRD), we proposed a classification model to predict risk level of drugs by using feature enhancement based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) and Synthetic Minority Over-Sampling Technique (SMOTE). A total of 985,960 spontaneous reports from 2011 to 2018 were selected from CSRD in Jiangsu Province as experimental data. After data preprocessing, a class-imbalance data set was obtained, which contained 887 Rx (accounting for 84.72%), 113 OTC-A (10.79%), and 47 OTC-B (4.49%). Taking drugs as the samples, ADRs as the features, and signal detection results obtained by proportional reporting ratio (PRR) method as the feature values, we constructed the original data matrix, where the last column represents the category label of each drug. Our proposed model expands the ADR data from both the sample space and the feature space. In terms of feature space, we use feature selection (FS) to screen ADR symptoms with higher importance scores. Then, we use GAN to generate artificial data, which are added to the feature space to achieve feature enhancement. In terms of sample space, we use SMOTE technology to expand the minority samples to balance three categories of drugs and minimize the classification deviation caused by the gap in the sample size. Finally, we use random forest (RF) algorithm to classify the feature-enhanced and balanced data set. The experimental results show that the accuracy of the proposed classification model reaches 98%. Our proposed model can well evaluate drug risk levels and provide automated methods for status switch of post-marketing drugs.

AB  - Background Electronic reporting and processing of suspected adverse drug reactions (ADRs) is increasing and has facilitated automated screening procedures. It is crucial for healthcare professionals to understand the nature and proper use of data available in pharmacovigilance practice. Objectives To (a) compare performance of EU-ADR [electronic healthcare record (EHR) exemplar] and FAERS [spontaneous reporting system (SRS) exemplar] databases in detecting signals using “positive” and “negative” drug-event reference sets; and (b) evaluate the impact of timing bias on sensitivity thresholds by comparing all data to data restricted to the time before a warning/regulatory action. Methods Ten events with known positive and negative reference sets were selected. Signals were identified when respective statistics exceeded defined thresholds. Main outcome measure Performance metrics, including sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and accuracy were calculated. In addition, the effect of regulatory action on the performance of signal detection in each data source was evaluated. Results The sensitivity for detecting signals in EHR data varied depending on the nature of the adverse events and increased substantially if the analyses were restricted to the period preceding the first regulatory action. Across all events, using data from all years, a sensitivity of 45–73 % was observed for EU-ADR and 77 % for FAERS. The specificity was high and similar for EU-ADR (82–96 %) and FAERS (98 %). EU-ADR data showed range of PPV (78–91 %) and accuracy (78–72 %) and FAERS data yielded a PPV of 97 % with 88 % accuracy. Conclusion Using all cumulative data, signal detection in SRS data achieved higher specificity and sensitivity than EHR data. However, when data were restricted to time prior to a regulatory action, performance characteristics changed in a manner consistent with both the type of data and nature of the ADR. Further research focusing on prospective validation of is necessary to learn more about the performance and utility of these databases in modern pharmacovigilance practice.

AB  - Background: We detected disproportionate reporting of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) with HMG-CoA-reductase inhibitors (statins) in the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) spontaneous adverse event (AE) reporting system (AERS). Purpose: To describe the original ALS signal and to provide additional context for interpreting the signal by conducting retrospective analyses of data from long-term, placebo-controlled clinical trials of statins. Methods: The ALS signal was detected using the multi-item gamma Poisson shrinker (MGPS) algorithm. All AERS cases of ALS reported in association with use of a statin were individually reviewed by two FDA neurologists. Manufacturers of lovastatin, pravastatin, simvastatin, fluvastatin, atorvastatin, cerivastatin, and rosuvastatin were requested to provide the number of cases of ALS diagnosed during all of their placebo-controlled statin trials that were at least 6 months in duration. Results: There were 91 US and foreign reports of ALS with statins in AERS. The data mining signal scores for ALS and statins ranged from 8.5 to 1.6. Data were obtained from 41 statin clinical trials ranging in duration from 6 months to 5 years and representing approximately 200 000 patient-years of exposure to statin and approximately 200 000 patient-years of exposure to placebo. Nine cases of ALS were reported in statin-treated patients and 10 cases in placebo-treated patients. Conclusions: Although we observed a data mining signal for ALS with statins in FDA's AERS, retrospective analyses of 41 statin clinical trials did not reveal an increased incidence of ALS in subjects treated with a statin compared with placebo.

AB  - Introduction: The rapid expansion of the Internet and computing power in recent years has opened up the possibility of using social media for pharmacovigilance. While this general concept has been proposed by many, central questions remain as to whether social media can provide earlier warnings for rare and serious events than traditional signal detection from spontaneous report data. Objective: Our objective was to examine whether specific product–adverse event pairs were reported via social media before being reported to the US FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS). Methods: A retrospective analysis of public Facebook and Twitter data was conducted for 10 recent FDA postmarketing safety signals at the drug–event pair level with six negative controls. Social media data corresponding to two years prior to signal detection of each product–event pair were compiled. Automated classifiers were used to identify each ‘post with resemblance to an adverse event’ (Proto-AE), among English language posts. A custom dictionary was used to translate Internet vernacular into Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA®) Preferred Terms. Drug safety physicians conducted a manual review to determine causality using World Health Organization-Uppsala Monitoring Centre (WHO-UMC) assessment criteria. Cases were also compared with those reported in FAERS. Findings: A total of 935,246 posts were harvested from Facebook and Twitter, from March 2009 through October 2014. The automated classifier identified 98,252 Proto-AEs. Of these, 13 posts were selected for causality assessment of product–event pairs. Clinical assessment revealed that posts had sufficient information to warrant further investigation for two possible product–event associations: dronedarone–vasculitis and Banana Boat Sunscreen--skin burns. No product–event associations were found among the negative controls. In one of the positive cases, the first report occurred in social media prior to signal detection from FAERS, whereas the other case occurred first in FAERS. Conclusions: An efficient semi-automated approach to social media monitoring may provide earlier insights into certain adverse events. More work is needed to elaborate additional uses for social media data in pharmacovigilance and to determine how they can be applied by regulatory agencies.

AB  - Typical antipsychotics are easily expressed as adverse events such as extrapyramidal symptom (EPS). On the other hand, incidence of adverse events due to atypical antipsychotics is low. Therefore, currently, atypical antipsychotics are widely used to treat schizophrenia. However, it has been reported that there is no difference in the frequency of EPS in atypical and typical antipsychotics. This study aimed to evaluate the expression profile of EPS in atypical and typical antipsychotics treatment using the Japanese Adverse Drug Event Report (JADER) database. We analyzed reports of EPS in the JADER database and calculated the reporting odds ratio (ROR) of antipsychotics potentially associated with EPS. We applied the Weibull shape parameter to time-to-event data in the JADER database. Consequently, there was little information to distinguish between the ROR of atypical and typical antipsychotics. A significant difference related to the time of onset of EPS in both antipsychotics was not recognized. However, when comparing each drug, Paliperi-done, Perospirone, Blonanserin, and Aripiprazole were relatively developed as EPS in the early stage. On the other hand, Risperidone, Clozapine, Olanzapine, and Quetiapine were developed as EPS not only at an early stage but also after long-term use. In addition, this finding was suggested from the result of the cumulative incidence of EPS in each drug and of the time-to-onset analysis using Weibull distribution. These findings may contribute to future clinical practice because we revealed the expression profile of EPS in treatment with atypical and typical antipsychotics.

AB  - Investigation of the occurrence time of adverse drug reactions helps to prevent the development and aggravation of adverse reactions, but the expression time of ganciclovir-induced adverse events has not been elucidated. In this study, using databases of spontaneous adverse event reports, the Japanese Adverse Drug Event Report database (JADER) and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)'s Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS), the incidence of adverse reactions due to ganciclovir and their expression time were analyzed. As a result of calculation of the reporting odds ratio (ROR) and 95% confidence interval for individual main adverse reactions of ganciclovir (cytopenia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, liver damage, and acute renal failure), a signal was detected for all adverse reactions in both databases, except for liver damage in JADER. Furthermore, the Weibull distribution was performed for the analysis of onset time of each ganciclovir-induced adverse event. The results of Weibull parameter α and β values of each adverse event in both JADER and FAERS suggested that most adverse events occurred within 30 d and classified into the early failure type, except that thrombocytopenia and acute renal failure in JADER classified into the random failure type. Based on these findings, it concluded that the paying attention to signs of each ganciclovirinduced adverse event is required from the early phase after ganciclovir administration. However, in FAERS, development after a long-term course also accounted for 11%, suggesting that long-term periodic monitoring of adverse reactions would be also required.

AB  - Background: Pharmacovigilance data-mining algorithms (DMAs) are known to generate significant numbers of false-positive signals of disproportionate reporting (SDRs), using various standards to define the terms true positive and false positive. Objective: To construct a highly inclusive reference event database of reported adverse events for a limited set of drugs, and to utilize that database to evaluate three DMAs for their overall yield of scientifically supported adverse drug effects, with an emphasis on ascertaining false-positive rates as defined by matching to the database, and to assess the overlap among SDRs detected by various DMAs. Methods: A sample of 35 drugs approved by the US FDA between 2000 and 2004 was selected, including three drugs added to cover therapeutic categories not included in the original sample. We compiled a reference event database of adverse event information for these drugs from historical and current US prescribing information, from peer-reviewed literature covering 1999 through March 2006, from regulatory actions announced by the FDA and from adverse event listings in the British National Formulary. Every adverse event mentioned in these sources was entered into the database, even those with minimal evidence for causality. To provide some selectivity regarding causality, each entry was assigned a level of evidence based on the source of the information, using rules developed by the authors. Using the FDA adverse event reporting system data for 2002 through 2005, SDRs were identified for each drug using three DMAs: an urn-model based algorithm, the Gamma Poisson Shrinker (GPS) and proportional reporting ratio (PRR), using previously published signalling thresholds. The absolute number and fraction of SDRs matching the reference event database at each level of evidence was determined for each report source and the data-mining method. Overlap of the SDR lists among the various methods and report sources was tabulated as well. Results: The GPS algorithm had the lowest overall yield of SDRs (763), with the highest fraction of events matching the reference event database (89 SDRs, 11.7%), excluding events described in the prescribing information at the time of drug approval. The urn model yielded more SDRs (1562), with a nonsignificantly lower fraction matching (175 SDRs, 11.2%). PRR detected still more SDRs (3616), but with a lower fraction matching (296 SDRs, 8.2%). In terms of overlap of SDRs among algorithms, PRR uniquely detected the highest number of SDRs (2231, with 144, or 6.5%,matching), followed by the urnmodel (212, with 26, or 12.3%, matching) and then GPS (0 SDRs uniquely detected). Conclusions: The three DMAs studied offer significantly different tradeoffs between the number of SDRs detected and the degree to which those SDRs are supported by external evidence. Those differences may reflect choices of detection thresholds as well as features of the algorithms themselves. For all three algorithms, there is a substantial fraction of SDRs for which no external supporting evidence can be found, even when a highly inclusive search for such evidence is conducted. © 2009 Adis Data Information BV.

AB  - Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs) are extremely hazardous to patients. ADR Detection aims to automatically determine whether a sentence is related to an ADR, which is a fundamental study for public health monitoring tasks, particularly for pharmacovigilance. Benchmark corpora are mostly sampled from biomedical literature or social media, but most of them are on small scales. Correspondingly, existing ADR detection models are either trained with additional corpora that are annotated manually or jointly trained with the ADR detection and the entity mention extraction task. However, directly training a method with additional corpora sampled from different sources may introduce noises and impact the performance of neural networks. Besides, jointly training a method with different tasks requires the annotation for other tasks, which still increases the annotation workload. To address the above issues, we formulate ADR detection as a text classification task and introduce an adversarial transfer learning framework into ADR detection. Our method focuses on exploiting a source corpus to improve the performance on small target corpora which only contain hundreds of training instances. Also, adversarial learning is applied to prevent corpus-specific features from being introduced into shared space so that corpora from different sources can be leveraged with minimum extra noises. Experimental results on three different benchmark corpora show that our proposed method consistently outperforms other state-of-the-art methods, especially on small corpora.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The detection of signals of adverse drug events (ADEs) has increased because of the use of data mining algorithms in spontaneous reporting systems (SRSs). However, different data mining algorithms have different traits and conditions for application. The objective of our study was to explore the application of association rule (AR) mining in ADE signal detection and to compare its performance with that of other algorithms. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Monte Carlo simulation was applied to generate drug-ADE reports randomly according to the characteristics of SRS datasets. Thousand simulated datasets were mined by AR and other algorithms. On average, 108,337 reports were generated by the Monte Carlo simulation. Based on the predefined criterion that 10% of the drug-ADE combinations were true signals, with RR equaling to 10, 4.9, 1.5, and 1.2, AR detected, on average, 284 suspected associations with a minimum support of 3 and a minimum lift of 1.2. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of the AR was 0.788, which was equivalent to that shown for other algorithms. Additionally, AR was applied to reports submitted to the Shanghai SRS in 2009. Five hundred seventy combinations were detected using AR from 24,297 SRS reports, and they were compared with recognized ADEs identified by clinical experts and various other sources. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: AR appears to be an effective method for ADE signal detection, both in simulated and real SRS datasets. The limitations of this method exposed in our study, i.e., a non-uniform thresholds setting and redundant rules, require further research.

AB  - Prescription information and adverse drug reactions (ADR) are two components of detailed medication instructions that can benefit many aspects of clinical research. Automatic extraction of this information from free-text narratives via Information Extraction (IE) can open it up to downstream uses. IE is commonly tackled by supervised Natural Language Processing (NLP) systems which rely on annotated training data. However, training data generation is manual, time-consuming, and labor-intensive. It is desirable to develop automatic methods for augmenting manually labeled data. We propose pseudo-data generation as one such automatic method. Pseudo-data are synthetic data generated by combining elements of existing labeled data. We propose and evaluate two sets of pseudo-data generation methods: knowledge-driven methods based on gazetteers and data-driven methods based on deep learning. We use the resulting pseudo-data to improve medication and ADR extraction. Data-driven pseudo-data are suitable for concept categories with high semantic regularities and short textual spans. Knowledge-driven pseudo-data are effective for concept categories with longer textual spans, assuming the knowledge base offers good coverage of these concepts. Combining the knowledge- and data-driven pseudo-data achieves significant performance improvement on medication names and ADRs over baselines limited to the use of available labeled data.

AB  - Historically the identification of adverse drug reactions relies on manual processes whereby doctors and hospitals report incidences to a central agency. In this paper we suggest a data mining approach using administrative pharmaceutical usage data linked with hospital admissions data. Patients, represented by temporal sequences of drug usage, are clustered using unsupervised learning techniques. Such techniques rely on a distance measure, and we propose in this paper such a distance measure for comparing drug usage sequences based on an event-type hierarchy, based around the hierarchical drug classification system. Although developed for a specific domain, we indicate that it is applicable in other applications involving data where event types form a hierarchical structure, such as is found in telecommunications applications. The approach modifies the Uniform Kernel K-Nearest Neighbour Clustering algorithm to constrain the merging of clusters to those clusters within a specified distance. The approach avoids losing clusters that are less dense yet far apart, as would occur without such a modification, but is typical of the types of applications we are interested in (where outliers are important). We demonstrate the algorithm through a successful application exploring for possible adverse drug events, in particular exploring hospital admissions for severe angioedema resulting from the usage of certain drugs and drug combinations. The interesting clusters thus identified have given clues to medical researchers for further investigations.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Adverse Drug reactions (ADR) cause a high number of deaths among hospitalized patients in developed countries. Major drug agencies have devoted a great interest in the early detection of ADRs due to their high incidence and increasing health care costs. Reporting systems are available in order for both healthcare professionals and patients to alert about possible ADRs. However, several studies have shown that these adverse events are underestimated. Our hypothesis is that health social networks could be a significant information source for the early detection of ADRs as well as of new drug indications. METHODS: In this work we present a system for detecting drug effects (which include both adverse drug reactions as well as drug indications) from user posts extracted from a Spanish health forum. Texts were processed using MeaningCloud, a multilingual text analysis engine, to identify drugs and effects. In addition, we developed the first Spanish database storing drugs as well as their effects automatically built from drug package inserts gathered from online websites. We then applied a distant-supervision method using the database on a collection of 84,000 messages in order to extract the relations between drugs and their effects. To classify the relation instances, we used a kernel method based only on shallow linguistic information of the sentences. RESULTS: Regarding Relation Extraction of drugs and their effects, the distant supervision approach achieved a recall of 0.59 and a precision of 0.48. CONCLUSIONS: The task of extracting relations between drugs and their effects from social media is a complex challenge due to the characteristics of social media texts. These texts, typically posts or tweets, usually contain many grammatical errors and spelling mistakes. Moreover, patients use lay terminology to refer to diseases, symptoms and indications that is not usually included in lexical resources in languages other than English.

AB  - Objectives: The objectives were to identify drugs related with anemia in children and evaluate the novelty of these correlations. Methods: The authors established a two-step method for detecting the relationship between drugs and anemia using electronic medical records (EMRs), which were obtained from 247,136 patients in Beijing Children’s Hospital between 2007 and 2017. The authors extracted potential drugs by mining cases for hemoglobin abnormalities from the EMR and then performed a retrospective cohort study to correlate them with anemia by calculating the matched odds ratios and 95% confidence interval using unconditional logistic regression analysis. Results: In total, nine positive drug-anemia associations were identified. Among them, the correlations of drugs fluconazole (OR 3.95; 95%CI: 2.65–5.87) and cefathiamidine (OR 3.49; 95%CI: 2.94–4.15) with anemia were considered new signals in both children and adults. Three associations of drugs, vancomycin, cefoperazone-sulbactam and ibuprofen, with anemia were considered new signals in children. Conclusion: The authors detected nine signals of drug-induced anemia, including two new signals in children and adults and three new signals in children. This study could serve as a model for using EMR and automatic mining to monitor adverse drug reaction signals in the pediatric population.

AB  - Post-marketing drug safety data sets are often massive, and entail problems with heterogeneity and selection bias. Nevertheless, quantitative methods have proven a very useful aid to help clinical experts in screening for previously unknown associations in these data sets. The WHO international drug safety database is the world's largest data set of its kind with over three million reports on suspected adverse drug reaction incidents. Since 1998, an exploratory data analysis method has been in routine use to screen for quantitative associations in this data set. This method was originally based on large sample approximations and limited to pairwise associations, but in this article we propose more accurate credibility interval estimates and extend the method to allow for the analysis of more complex quantitative associations. The accuracy of the proposed credibility intervals is evaluated through comparison to precise Monte Carlo simulations. In addition, we propose a Mantel-Haen szel -type adjustment to control for suspected confounders. Copyright (c) 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - In this paper we describe an evaluation of the potential of classical information extraction methods to extract drug-related attributes, including adverse drug events, and compare to more recently developed neural methods. We use the 2018 N2C2 shared task data as our gold standard data set for training. We train support vector machine classifiers to detect drug and drug attribute spans, and pair these detected entities as training instances for an SVM relation classifier, with both systems using standard features. We compare to baseline neural methods that use standard contextualized embedding representations for entity and relation extraction. The SVM-based system and a neural system obtain comparable results, with the SVM system doing better on concepts and the neural system performing better on relation extraction tasks. The neural system obtains surprisingly strong results compared to the system based on years of research in developing features for information extraction.

AB  - Adverse drug events (ADEs) are unexpected incidents caused by the administration of a drug or medication. To identify and extract these events, we require information about not just the drug itself but attributes describing the drug (e.g., strength, dosage), the reason why the drug was initially prescribed, and any adverse reaction to the drug. This paper explores the relationship between a drug and its associated attributes using relation extraction techniques. We explore three approaches: a rule-based approach, a deep learning-based approach, and a contextualized language model-based approach. We evaluate our system on the n2c2-2018 ADE extraction dataset. Our experimental results demonstrate that the contextualized language model-based approach outperformed other models overall and obtain the state-of-the-art performance in ADE extraction with a Precision of 0.93, Recall of 0.96, and an F(1) score of 0.94; however, for certain relation types, the rule-based approach obtained a higher Precision and Recall than either learning approach.

AB  - Drug-drug interactions (DDIs) extraction is one of the important tasks in the field of biomedical relation extraction, which plays an important role in the field of pharmacovigilance. Previous neural network based models have achieved good performance in DDIs extraction. However, most of the previous models did not make good use of the information of drug entity names, which can help to judge the relation between drugs. This is mainly because drug names are often very complex, leading to the fact that neural network models cannot understand their semantics directly. To address this issue, we propose a DDIs extraction model using multiple entity-aware attentions with various entity information. We use an output-modified bidirectional transformer (BioBERT) and a bidirectional gated recurrent unit layer (BiGRU) to obtain the vector representation of sentences. The vectors of drug description documents encoded by Doc2Vec are used as drug description information, which is an external knowledge to our model. Then we construct three different kinds of entity-aware attentions to get the sentence representations with entity information weighted, including attentions using the drug description information. The outputs of attention layers are concatenated and fed into a multi-layer perception layer. Finally, we get the result by a softmax classifier. The F-score is used to evaluate our model, which is also adopted by most previous DDIs extraction models. We evaluate our proposed model on the DDIExtraction 2013 corpus, which is the benchmark corpus of this domain, and achieves the state-of-the-art result (80.9% in F-score).

AB  - Drug-drug interactions are critical in studying drug side effects. Thus, quickly and accurately identifying the relationship between drugs is necessary. Current methods for biomedical relation extraction include only the sequential information of sentences, while syntactic graph representations have not been explored in DDI extraction. We herein present a novel hybrid model to extract a biomedical relation that combines a bidirectional gated recurrent unit (Bi-GRU) and a graph convolutional network (GCN). Bi-GRU and GCN are used to automatically learn the features of sequential representation and syntactic graph representation, respectively. The experimental results show that the advantages of Bi-GRU and GCN in DDI relation extraction are complementary, and that the utilization of Bi-GRU and GCN further improves the model performance. We evaluated our model on the DDI extraction-2013 shared task and discovered that our method achieved reasonable performance.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Information about drug-drug interactions (DDIs) is crucial for computational applications such as pharmacovigilance and drug repurposing. However, existing sources of DDIs have the problems of low coverage, low accuracy and low agreement. One common type of DDIs is related to the mechanism of drug metabolism: a DDI relation may be caused by different interactions (e.g., substrate, inhibit) between drugs and enzymes in the drug metabolism process. Thus, information from drug enzyme interactions (DEIs) serves as important supportive evidence for DDIs. Further, potential DDIs present implicitly could be detected by inference and reasoning based on DEIs. METHODS: In this article, we propose a hybrid approach to combining machine learning algorithm with trigger words and syntactic patterns, for DEI relation extraction from biomedical literature. The extracted DEI relations are used for reasoning to infer potential DDI relations, based on a defined drug-enzyme ontology incorporating biological knowledge. RESULTS: Evaluation results demonstrate that the performance of DEI relation extraction is promising, with an F-measure of 84.97% on the in vivo dataset and 65.58% on the in vitro dataset. Further, the inferred DDIs achieved a precision of 83.19% on the in vivo dataset and 70.94% on the in vitro dataset, respectively. A further examination showed that the overlaps between our inferred DDIs and those present in DrugBank were 42.02% on the in vivo dataset and 19.23 % on the in vitro dataset, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: This paper proposed an effective approach to extract DEI relations from biomedical literature. Potential DDIs not present in existing knowledge bases were then inferred based on the extracted DEIs, demonstrating the capability of the proposed approach to detect DDIs with scientific evidence for pharmacovigilance and drug repurposing applications.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Detecting adverse drug events (ADEs) and medications related information in clinical notes is important for both hospital medical care and medical research. We describe our clinical natural language processing (NLP) system to automatically extract medical concepts and relations related to ADEs and medications from clinical narratives. This work was part of the 2018 National NLP Clinical Challenges Shared Task and Workshop on Adverse Drug Events and Medication Extraction. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The authors developed a hybrid clinical NLP system that employs a knowledge-based general clinical NLP system for medical concepts extraction, and a task-specific deep learning system for relations identification using attention-based bidirectional long short-term memory networks. RESULTS: The systems were evaluated as part of the 2018 National NLP Clinical Challenges challenge, and our attention-based bidirectional long short-term memory networks based system obtained an F-measure of 0.9442 for relations identification task, ranking fifth at the challenge, and had <2% difference from the best system. Error analysis was also conducted targeting at figuring out the root causes and possible approaches for improvement. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate the generic approaches and the practice of connecting general purposed clinical NLP system to task-specific requirements with deep learning methods. Our results indicate that a well-designed hybrid NLP system is capable of ADE and medication-related information extraction, which can be used in real-world applications to support ADE-related researches and medical decisions.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Automated analysis of vaccine postmarketing surveillance narrative reports is important to understand the progression of rare but severe vaccine adverse events (AEs). This study implemented and evaluated state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms for named entity recognition to extract nervous system disorder-related events from vaccine safety reports. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We collected Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) related influenza vaccine safety reports from the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) from 1990 to 2016. VAERS reports were selected and manually annotated with major entities related to nervous system disorders, including, investigation, nervous_AE, other_AE, procedure, social_circumstance, and temporal_expression. A variety of conventional machine learning and deep learning algorithms were then evaluated for the extraction of the above entities. We further pretrained domain-specific BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) using VAERS reports (VAERS BERT) and compared its performance with existing models. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Ninety-one VAERS reports were annotated, resulting in 2512 entities. The corpus was made publicly available to promote community efforts on vaccine AEs identification. Deep learning-based methods (eg, bi-long short-term memory and BERT models) outperformed conventional machine learning-based methods (ie, conditional random fields with extensive features). The BioBERT large model achieved the highest exact match F-1 scores on nervous_AE, procedure, social_circumstance, and temporal_expression; while VAERS BERT large models achieved the highest exact match F-1 scores on investigation and other_AE. An ensemble of these 2 models achieved the highest exact match microaveraged F-1 score at 0.6802 and the second highest lenient match microaveraged F-1 score at 0.8078 among peer models.

AB  - With the rapidly growing use of electronic health records, the possibility of large-scale clinical information extraction has drawn much attention. We aim to extract adverse drug events and effects from records. As the first step of this challenge, this study assessed (1) how much adverse-effect information is contained in records, and (2) automatic extracting accuracy of the current standard Natural Language Processing (NLP) system. Results revealed that 7.7% of records include adverse event information, and that 59% of them (4.5% in total) can be extracted automatically. This result is particularly encouraging, considering the massive amounts of records, which are increasing daily.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Pharmacovigilance and drug-safety surveillance are crucial for monitoring adverse drug events (ADEs), but the main ADE-reporting systems such as Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System face challenges such as underreporting. Therefore, as complementary surveillance, data on ADEs are extracted from electronic health record (EHR) notes via natural language processing (NLP). As NLP develops, many up-to-date machine-learning techniques are introduced in this field, such as deep learning and multi-task learning (MTL). However, only a few studies have focused on employing such techniques to extract ADEs. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to design a deep learning model for extracting ADEs and related information such as medications and indications. Since extraction of ADE-related information includes two steps-named entity recognition and relation extraction-our second objective was to improve the deep learning model using multi-task learning between the two steps. METHODS: We employed the dataset from the Medication, Indication and Adverse Drug Events (MADE) 1.0 challenge to train and test our models. This dataset consists of 1089 EHR notes of cancer patients and includes 9 entity types such as Medication, Indication, and ADE and 7 types of relations between these entities. To extract information from the dataset, we proposed a deep-learning model that uses a bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) conditional random field network to recognize entities and a BiLSTM-Attention network to extract relations. To further improve the deep-learning model, we employed three typical MTL methods, namely, hard parameter sharing, parameter regularization, and task relation learning, to build three MTL models, called HardMTL, RegMTL, and LearnMTL, respectively. RESULTS: Since extraction of ADE-related information is a two-step task, the result of the second step (ie, relation extraction) was used to compare all models. We used microaveraged precision, recall, and F1 as evaluation metrics. Our deep learning model achieved state-of-the-art results (F1=65.9%), which is significantly higher than that (F1=61.7%) of the best system in the MADE1.0 challenge. HardMTL further improved the F1 by 0.8%, boosting the F1 to 66.7%, whereas RegMTL and LearnMTL failed to boost the performance. CONCLUSIONS: Deep learning models can significantly improve the performance of ADE-related information extraction. MTL may be effective for named entity recognition and relation extraction, but it depends on the methods, data, and other factors. Our results can facilitate research on ADE detection, NLP, and machine learning.

AB  - BACKGROUND: An adverse drug event (ADE) is commonly defined as "an injury resulting from medical intervention related to a drug." Providing information related to ADEs and alerting caregivers at the point of care can reduce the risk of prescription and diagnostic errors and improve health outcomes. ADEs captured in structured data in electronic health records (EHRs) as either coded problems or allergies are often incomplete, leading to underreporting. Therefore, it is important to develop capabilities to process unstructured EHR data in the form of clinical notes, which contain a richer documentation of a patient's ADE. Several natural language processing (NLP) systems have been proposed to automatically extract information related to ADEs. However, the results from these systems showed that significant improvement is still required for the automatic extraction of ADEs from clinical notes. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to improve the automatic extraction of ADEs and related information such as drugs, their attributes, and reason for administration from the clinical notes of patients. METHODS: This research was conducted using discharge summaries from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) database obtained through the 2018 National NLP Clinical Challenges (n2c2) annotated with drugs, drug attributes (ie, strength, form, frequency, route, dosage, duration), ADEs, reasons, and relations between drugs and other entities. We developed a deep learning-based system for extracting these drug-centric concepts and relations simultaneously using a joint method enhanced with contextualized embeddings, a position-attention mechanism, and knowledge representations. The joint method generated different sentence representations for each drug, which were then used to extract related concepts and relations simultaneously. Contextualized representations trained on the MIMIC-III database were used to capture context-sensitive meanings of words. The position-attention mechanism amplified the benefits of the joint method by generating sentence representations that capture long-distance relations. Knowledge representations were obtained from graph embeddings created using the US Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System database to improve relation extraction, especially when contextual clues were insufficient. RESULTS: Our system achieved new state-of-the-art results on the n2c2 data set, with significant improvements in recognizing crucial drug-reason (F1=0.650 versus F1=0.579) and drug-ADE (F1=0.490 versus F1=0.476) relations. CONCLUSIONS: This study presents a system for extracting drug-centric concepts and relations that outperformed current state-of-the-art results and shows that contextualized embeddings, position-attention mechanisms, and knowledge graph embeddings effectively improve deep learning-based concepts and relation extraction. This study demonstrates the potential for deep learning-based methods to help extract real-world evidence from unstructured patient data for drug safety surveillance.

AB  - : The sheer amount of information about potential adverse drug events published in medical case reports pose major challenges for drug safety experts to perform timely monitoring. Efficient strategies for identification and extraction of information about potential adverse drug events from free-text resources are needed to support pharmacovigilance research and pharmaceutical decision making. Therefore, this work focusses on the adaptation of a machine learning-based system for the identification and extraction of potential adverse drug event relations from MEDLINE case reports. It relies on a high quality corpus that was manually annotated using an ontology-driven methodology. Qualitative evaluation of the system showed robust results. An experiment with large scale relation extraction from MEDLINE delivered under-identified potential adverse drug events not reported in drug monographs. Overall, this approach provides a scalable auto-assistance platform for drug safety professionals to automatically collect potential adverse drug events communicated as free-text data.

AB  - Pharmacovigilance systems aim at early detection of adverse effects of marketed drugs. They maintain large spontaneous reporting databases for which several automatic signaling methods have been developed. One limit of those methods is that the decision rules for the signal generation are based on arbitrary thresholds. In this article, we propose a new signal-generation procedure. The decision criterion is formulated in terms of a critical region for the P-values resulting from the reporting odds ratio method as well as from the Fisher's exact test. For the latter, we also study the use of mid-P-values. The critical region is defined by the false discovery rate, which can be estimated by adapting the P-values mixture model based procedures to one-sided tests. The methodology is mainly illustrated with the location-based estimator procedure. It is studied through a large simulation study and applied to the French pharmacovigilance database.

AB  - Social media platforms are emerging digital communication channels that provide an easy way for common people to share their health and medication experiences online. With more people discussing their health information online publicly, social media platforms present a rich source of information for exploring adverse drug reactions (ADRs). ADRs are major public health problems that result in deaths and hospitalizations of millions of people. Unfortunately, not all ADRs are identified before a drug is made available in the market. In this study, an ADR event monitoring system is developed which can recognize ADR mentions from a tweet and classify its assertion. We explored several entity recognition features, feature conjunctions, and feature selection and analyzed their characteristics and impacts on the recognition of ADRs, which have never been studied previously. The results demonstrate that the entity recognition performance for ADR can achieve an F-score of 0.562 on the PSB Social Media Mining shared task dataset, which outperforms the partial-matching-based method by 0.122. After feature selection, the F-score can be further improved by 0.026. This novel technique of text mining utilizing shared online social media data will open an array of opportunities for researchers to explore various health related issues.

AB  - During the 2010-2011 influenza season, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Food and Drug Administration conducted enhanced vaccine safety monitoring for possible febrile seizures in all trivalent influenza vaccine (TIV) products in the United States using the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). We used Empirical Bayesian data mining techniques to assess disproportionate reporting after TIV and reviewed febrile seizure reports in children aged <5years. On November 23, 2010, the combination of the coding term "febrile convulsion" and the Fluzone® TIV product exceeded a predetermined threshold in the VAERS database. By December 10, we confirmed 43 reports of febrile seizure following TIV in children aged 6-23months. Clinical features of most reports were consistent with typical uncomplicated febrile seizures, and all children recovered. Further epidemiologic assessment of a possible association between TIV and febrile seizures was undertaken in a separate, population-based vaccine safety monitoring system. © 2011.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are believed to be a leading cause of death in the world. Pharmacovigilance systems are aimed at early detection of ADRs. With the popularity of social media, Web forums and discussion boards become important sources of data for consumers to share their drug use experience, as a result may provide useful information on drugs and their adverse reactions. In this study, we propose an automated ADR related posts filtering mechanism using text classification methods. In real-life settings, ADR related messages are highly distributed in social media, while non-ADR related messages are unspecific and topically diverse. It is expensive to manually label a large amount of ADR related messages (positive examples) and non-ADR related messages (negative examples) to train classification systems. To mitigate this challenge, we examine the use of a partially supervised learning classification method to automate the process. METHODS: We propose a novel pharmacovigilance system leveraging a Latent Dirichlet Allocation modeling module and a partially supervised classification approach. We select drugs with more than 500 threads of discussion, and collect all the original posts and comments of these drugs using an automatic Web spidering program as the text corpus. Various classifiers were trained by varying the number of positive examples and the number of topics. The trained classifiers were applied to 3000 posts published over 60 days. Top-ranked posts from each classifier were pooled and the resulting set of 300 posts was reviewed by a domain expert to evaluate the classifiers. RESULTS: Compare to the alternative approaches using supervised learning methods and three general purpose partially supervised learning methods, our approach performs significantly better in terms of precision, recall, and the F measure (the harmonic mean of precision and recall), based on a computational experiment using online discussion threads from Medhelp. CONCLUSIONS: Our design provides satisfactory performance in identifying ADR related posts for post-marketing drug surveillance. The overall design of our system also points out a potentially fruitful direction for building other early warning systems that need to filter big data from social media networks.

AB  - BACKGROUND: With the increasing popularity of Web 2.0 applications, social media has made it possible for individuals to post messages on adverse drug reactions. In such online conversations, patients discuss their symptoms, medical history, and diseases. These disorders may correspond to adverse drug reactions (ADRs) or any other medical condition. Therefore, methods must be developed to distinguish between false positives and true ADR declarations. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate a method for filtering out disorder terms that did not correspond to adverse events by using the distance (as number of words) between the drug term and the disorder or symptom term in the post. We hypothesized that the shorter the distance between the disorder name and the drug, the higher the probability to be an ADR. METHODS: We analyzed a corpus of 648 messages corresponding to a total of 1654 (drug and disorder) pairs from 5 French forums using Gaussian mixture models and an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm . RESULTS: The distribution of the distances between the drug term and the disorder term enabled the filtering of 50.03% (733/1465) of the disorders that were not ADRs. Our filtering strategy achieved a precision of 95.8% and a recall of 50.0%. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that such distance between terms can be used for identifying false positives, thereby improving ADR detection in social media.

AB  - Background. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) released a safety warning of Fournier gangrene (FG), a rare but serious adverse effect of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors in August 2018. However, existing studies have focused mainly on individual FG case reports. Although several previous studies conducted reviews of cases, objective scientific analysis was not applied, and the prognosis data were inadequate. Objective. This study is aimed at presenting data supplementary to existing studies by analysing postmarketing adverse event reports in the FDA Adverse Events Reporting System (FAERS) database. Multiple statistical analysis methods were applied to evaluate the potential association between SGLT2 inhibitors and FG, thus providing reliable and professionalized medication usage recommendations for SGLT2 inhibitors in clinical practice. Methods. Disproportionality analysis and Bayesian analysis were applied for data mining among the suspected adverse event reports of FG associated with SGLT2 inhibitors recorded in the FAERS database during the period from January 2004 to September 2019. Results. There were 542 FG cases identified in the FAERS database in patients receiving SGLT2 inhibitors. Among all SGLT2 inhibitor therapies, empagliflozin was associated with the highest number of FG reports (232 in total), while empagliflozin plus metformin had the strongest association with FG occurrence with the reporting odds ratio (ROR 54.79, 95% two-sided CI 31.56 to 95.12) and proportional reporting ratio (PRR 53.36, χ2 666.70). There were 391 patients who underwent initial or prolonged hospitalization (72.14%), and 26 patients died (4.81%). Three new FG cases caused by ertugliflozin were found in 2019. Conclusion. The analysis of SGLT2 inhibitor-associated FG reports in the FAERS database identified signals between the drug and adverse events of interest. It also provides comprehensive information on the characteristics of FG onset and prognosis. Clinicians should pay more attention to this rare but severe adverse event when prescribing SGLT2 inhibitors in clinical practice.

AB  - Pharmacovigilance is the activity related to the collection, analysis and prevention of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) induced by drugs. It leads to the safety survey of pharmaceutical products. The pharmacovigilance process benefits from the traditional statistical approaches and also from the qualitative information on semantic relations between close ADR terms, such as SMQs or hierarchical levels of MedDRA. In this work, our objective is to detect the semantic relatedness between the ADR MedDRA terms. To achieve this, we combine two approaches: semantic similarity algorithms computed within structured resources and terminology structuring methods applied to a raw list of the MedDRA terms. We compare these methods between them and study their differences and complementarity. The results are evaluated against the gold standard manually compiled within the pharmacovigilance area and also with an expert. The combination of the methods leads to an improved recall.

Methods: Disproportionality and Bayesian analyses were performed in mining data of suspected hemorrhagic events after antithrombotic drug use from the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) from January 2004 to September 2019. The time to onset and fatality rate of hemorrhage following different antithrombotic regimens were also compared. Results: A total of 84,998 reports of hemorrhage-related adverse events with the use of antithrombotic drugs were identified. The patients included were mostly from the Americas (80.87%) and Europe (13.22%), with most data submitted by nonhealthcare professionals. Among the seven antithrombotic drug monotherapies, betrixaban had the highest association with hemorrhage based on the highest reporting odds ratio (ROR, 829.95; 95% CI = 113.61-6063.15), proportional reporting ratio (PRR, 24.68, χ2 = 804.24), and multi-item gamma Poisson shrinker (MGPS, 24.68, 95% one-sided CI = 4.67). The combination therapies of clopidogrel plus new oral anticoagulants had higher RORs, PRRs, and empirical Bayesian geometric means (EBGMs) than the antithrombotic drug monotherapies. Hemorrhage associated with rivaroxaban plus clopidogrel appeared to have an earlier onset (171 days vs 219 days, 95% two-sided CI =68.68-27.34, p < 0.0001) and a lower fatality rate (15.30% vs 17.74%, p<0.05) than that associated with rivaroxaban monotherapy. Conclusion: This study provides a relevant overview of the hemorrhagic complications/fatalities associated with different antithrombotic regimens in their real-world use. Among the combination therapies, clopidogrel plus DOACs were found to have stronger associations with hemorrhage than traditional dual antithrombotic therapies. Rivaroxaban showed a stronger association with hemorrhage than other antithrombotic drug monotherapies, and apixaban monotherapy appeared to have weaker associations with hemorrhage than others.

AB  - Severe hepatic adverse drug reactions have been occasionally reported in the literature for the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), venlafaxine and nefazodone. In addition, a few case reports have suggested a possible association between SSRI treatment and pancreatitis. To further investigate this issue, a Bayesian confidence propagation neural network (BCPNN) method was applied on the World Health Organization database of adverse drug reactions. This method identifies whether a drug/adverse drug reaction combination is reported more frequently to the database than expected on the basis of chance alone compared to general reporting in the database. A statistically significant unexpected high number of reports were found for nefazodone and hepatic injury, relative to the generality of the dataset but, for the other drug/adverse drug reaction combinations, no such association was found. The nefazodone finding is in accordance with data from other publications, suggesting that the risk of hepatic injury is increased. However, because of the nature of the BCPNN, the negative findings do not necessarily prove that there is no excess risk for hepatic injury/pancreatitis during treatment with drugs other than nefazodone. Further studies are required using alternative methodologies to demonstrate whether the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors or venlafaxine may cause hepatic injury or pancreatitis.

AB  - We detected disproportionate reports of premature ovarian insufficiency (POI) and related events, including amenorrhea, menstruation irregular, FSH increased, and premature menopause, following human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine from FDA Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). The signal was detected by the methods of Bayesian Confidence Propagation Neural Network (BCPNN) and Multi-item Gamma Poisson Shrinker (MGPS). When both methods detected a positive result, a signal was generated. Besides, time-scan map is drawn based on the IC value and 95%CI of BCPNN, if the IC curve showed a steady upward trend and the 95%CI narrowed, the signal was stable and strong association.The results showed that there were not POI reports of HPV vaccine, but VAERS received a total of 2, 389, 27 POI related events for HPV2, HPV4, HPV9 respectively from the year of marketed to 2018. No signal was detected for HPV2. HPV4-POI ralated events were all detected as signals by two methods. There was only one signal of menstruation irregular for HPV9. Time scan of HPV4-POI ralated events showed those signals were stability and strong association, but not for HPV9. Our results only represent statistical association between HPV vaccine and POI related events, causal relationship needs further investigation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Previously, adverse event reports (AERs) submitted to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) database were reviewed to confirm platinum agent-associated hypersensitivity reactions. The present study was performed to confirm whether the database could suggest the hypersensitivity reactions caused by anticancer agents, paclitaxel, docetaxel, procarbazine, asparaginase, teniposide, and etoposide. METHODS: After a revision of arbitrary drug names and the deletion of duplicated submissions, AERs involving candidate agents were analyzed. The National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0 was applied to evaluate the susceptibility to hypersensitivity reactions, and standardized official pharmacovigilance tools were used for quantitative detection of signals, i.e., drug-associated adverse events, including the proportional reporting ratio, the reporting odds ratio, the information component given by a Bayesian confidence propagation neural network, and the empirical Bayes geometric mean. RESULTS: Based on 1,644,220 AERs from 2004 to 2009, the signals were detected for paclitaxel-associated mild, severe, and lethal hypersensitivity reactions, and docetaxel-associated lethal reactions. However, the total number of adverse events occurring with procarbazine, asparaginase, teniposide, or etoposide was not large enough to detect signals. CONCLUSIONS: The FDA's adverse event reporting system, AERS, and the data mining methods used herein are useful for confirming drug-associated adverse events, but the number of co-occurrences is an important factor in signal detection.

AB  - Purpose: Abacavir is associated with an infrequent but potentially serious hypersensitivity reaction (HSR) that can include wide range of signs and symptoms. Identification of this reaction through medical insurance claims could provide a simple and efficient means of monitoring the incidence of abacavir hypersensitivity in large populations of patients. Methods: Using data from a safety study of 948 abacavir users with 22 hypersensitivity events identified from claims and validated through medical record review, we used a recursive partitioning analysis to construct an algorithm to differentiate between patients with and without validated adverse events. Bootstrap resampling techniques provided validation for the analysis. Results: The analysis produced a classification tree with three decision nodes that comprised the best indicators of HSRs. The predictors included any one of several specific symptoms commonly found with this reaction, a claims diagnosis of adverse effect of drug, anaphylactic shock or unspecified allergy, and a discontinuation in abacavir prior to completing a 90-day course of therapy. The algorithm demonstrated 95% sensitivity and 90% specificity when tested using a bootstrap resampling approach with the current data. Conclusions: A sensitive and specific algorithm for identifying abacavir hypersensitivity from claims was created. This algorithm would permit efficient identification of charts for medical review. Further testing of the algorithm with additional medical claims data for abacavir users will be required to ascertain its validity across databases. Copyright © 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Medical articles covering adverse drug events (ADEs) are systematically reported by pharmaceutical companies for drug safety information purposes. Although policies governing reporting to regulatory bodies vary among countries and regions, all medical article reporting may be categorized as precision or recall based. Recall-based reporting, which is implemented in Japan, requires the reporting of any possible ADE. Therefore, recall-based reporting can introduce numerous false negatives or substantial amounts of noise, a problem that is difficult to address using limited manual labor. OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to develop an automated system that could identify ADE-related medical articles, support recall-based reporting, and alleviate manual labor in Japanese pharmaceutical companies. METHODS: Using medical articles as input, our system based on natural language processing applies document-level classification to extract articles containing ADEs (replacing manual labor in the first screening) and sentence-level classification to extract sentences within those articles that imply ADEs (thus supporting experts in the second screening). We used 509 Japanese medical articles annotated by a medical engineer to evaluate the performance of the proposed system. RESULTS: Document-level classification yielded an F1 of 0.903. Sentence-level classification yielded an F1 of 0.413. These were averages of fivefold cross-validations. CONCLUSIONS: A simple automated system may alleviate the manual labor involved in screening drug safety-related medical articles in pharmaceutical companies. After improving the accuracy of the sentence-level classification by considering a wider context, we intend to apply this system toward real-world postmarketing surveillance.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Drug-drug interaction (DDI) is of serious concern, causing over 30% of all adverse drug reactions and resulting in significant morbidity and mortality. Early discovery of adverse DDI is critical to prevent patient harm. Spontaneous reporting systems have been a major resource for drug safety surveillance that routinely collects adverse event reports from patients and healthcare professionals. In this study, we present a novel approach to discover DDIs from the Food and Drug Administration's adverse event reporting system. METHODS: Data-driven discovery of DDI is an extremely challenging task because higher-order associations require analysis of all combinations of drugs and adverse events and accurate estimate of the relationships between drug combinations and adverse event require cause-and-effect inference. To efficiently identify causal relationships, we introduce the causal concept into association rule mining by developing a method called Causal Association Rule Discovery (CARD). The properties of V-structures in Bayesian Networks are utilized in the search for causal associations. To demonstrate feasibility, CARD is compared to the traditional association rule mining (AR) method in DDI identification. RESULTS: Based on physician evaluation of 100 randomly selected higher-order associations generated by CARD and AR, CARD is demonstrated to be more accurate in identifying known drug interactions compared to AR, 20% vs. 10% respectively. Moreover, CARD yielded a lower number of drug combinations that are unknown to interact, i.e., 50% for CARD and 79% for AR. CONCLUSION: Evaluation analysis demonstrated that CARD is more likely to identify true causal drug variables and associations to adverse event.

AB  - Adverse drug reactions (ADR) include adverse reactions which are caused by drug quality problems or improper medication. In order to solve the issues which are triggered by the lack of research on local adverse drug reactions in Xinjiang and the shortcomings of traditional models in dealing with irregular sentences, this paper proposes a method for adverse drug identification in Xinjiang. The method is combined with BiLSTM-CNN hybrid network which is based on attention mechanism. The method analyzes deeply on the network text context feature and the attention pooling mechanism. These measures can reduce the information loss while acquiring the local convolution feature. The integration of attention mechanism, the addition of weight information make it becomes more sensitive to capture the importance of features which brings improvement of the ability to express features. Finally, the experiment was carried out in the Xinjiang Adverse Drug Reaction Data Set. The accuracy rate of this model in Xinjiang local drug adverse reaction identification was 87.27%, the recall rate was 88.87%, and the F value was 87.65%. Compared with the common convolutional neural network and BiLSTM, it achieves better classification results, and has obvious advantages for irregular grammar and long sentence recognition. Experiments showed that the ATT-BiLSTM-CNN model can rapidly improve the recognition performance of local adverse drug reactions in Xinjiang.

AB  - For the purpose of post-marketing drug safety surveillance, which has traditionally relied on the voluntary reporting of individual cases of adverse drug events (ADEs), other sources of information are now being explored, including electronic health records (EHRs), which give us access to enormous amounts of longitudinal observations of the treatment of patients and their drug use. Adverse drug events, which can be encoded in EHRs with certain diagnosis codes, are, however, heavily underreported. It is therefore important to develop capabilities to process, by means of computational methods, the more unstructured EHR data in the form of clinical notes, where clinicians may describe and reason around suspected ADEs. In this study, we report on the creation of an annotated corpus of Swedish health records for the purpose of learning to identify information pertaining to ADEs present in clinical notes. To this end, three key tasks are tackled: recognizing relevant named entities (disorders, symptoms, drugs), labeling attributes of the recognized entities (negation, speculation, temporality), and relationships between them (indication, adverse drug event). For each of the three tasks, leveraging models of distributional semantics - i.e., unsupervised methods that exploit co-occurrence information to model, typically in vector space, the meaning of words - and, in particular, combinations of such models, is shown to improve the predictive performance. The ability to make use of such unsupervised methods is critical when faced with large amounts of sparse and high-dimensional data, especially in domains where annotated resources are scarce.

AB  - The pharmaceutical industry, consumer protection groups, users of medications and government oversight agencies are all strongly interested in identifying adverse reactions to drugs. While a clinical trial of a drug may use only a thousand patients, once a drug is released on the market it may be taken by millions of patients. As a result, in many cases adverse drug events (ADEs) are observed in the broader population that were not identified during clinical trials. Therefore, there is a need for continued, post-marketing surveillance of drugs to identify previously-unanticipated ADEs. This paper casts this problem as a reverse machine learning task, related to relational subgroup discovery and provides an initial evaluation of this approach based on experiments with an actual EMR/EHR and known adverse drug events.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Social media platforms are increasingly seen as a source of data on a wide range of health issues. Twitter is of particular interest for public health surveillance because of its public nature. However, the very public nature of social media platforms such as Twitter may act as a barrier to public health surveillance, as people may be reluctant to publicly disclose information about their health. This is of particular concern in the context of diseases that are associated with a certain degree of stigma, such as HIV/AIDS. OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study is to assess whether adverse effects of HIV drug treatment and associated sentiments can be determined using publicly available data from social media. METHODS: We describe a combined approach of machine learning and crowdsourced human assessment to identify adverse effects of HIV drug treatment solely on individual reports posted publicly on Twitter. Starting from a large dataset of 40 million tweets collected over three years, we identify a very small subset (1642; 0.004%) of individual reports describing personal experiences with HIV drug treatment. RESULTS: Despite the small size of the extracted final dataset, the summary representation of adverse effects attributed to specific drugs, or drug combinations, accurately captures well-recognized toxicities. In addition, the data allowed us to discriminate across specific drug compounds, to identify preferred drugs over time, and to capture novel events such as the availability of preexposure prophylaxis. CONCLUSIONS: The effect of limited data sharing due to the public nature of the data can be partially offset by the large number of people sharing data in the first place, an observation that may play a key role in digital epidemiology in general.

AB  - Social media sites, such as Twitter, are a rich source of many kinds of information, including health-related information. Accurate detection of entities such as diseases, drugs, and symptoms could be used for biosurveillance (e.g. monitoring of flu) and identification of adverse drug events. However, a critical assessment of performance of current text mining technology on Twitter has not been done yet in the medical domain. Here, we study the development of a Twitter data set annotated with relevant medical entities which we have publicly released. The manual annotation results show that it is possible to perform high-quality annotation despite of the complexity of medical terminology and the lack of context in a tweet. Furthermore, we have evaluated the capability of state-of-the-art approaches to reproduce the annotations in the data set. The best methods achieve F-scores of 55-66%. The data analysis and the preliminary results provide valuable insights on identifying medical entities in Twitter for various applications.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Pregnant women are largely exposed to medications. However, knowledge is lacking about their effects on pregnancy and the fetus. OBJECTIVE: This study sought to evaluate the potential of high-dimensional propensity scores and high-dimensional disease risk scores for automated signal detection in pregnant women from medico-administrative databases in the context of drug-induced prematurity. METHODS: We used healthcare claims and hospitalization discharges of a 1/97th representative sample of the French population. We tested the association between prematurity and drug exposure during the trimester before delivery, for all drugs prescribed to at least five pregnancies. We compared different strategies (1) for building the two scores, including two machine-learning methods and (2) to account for these scores in the final logistic regression models: adjustment, weighting, and matching. We also proposed a new signal detection criterion derived from these scores: the p value relative decrease. Evaluation was performed by assessing the relevance of the signals using a literature review and clinical expertise. RESULTS: Screening 400 drugs from a cohort of 57,407 pregnancies, we observed that choosing between the two machine-learning methods had little impact on the generated signals. Score adjustment performed better than weighting and matching. Using the p value relative decrease efficiently filtered out spurious signals while maintaining a number of relevant signals similar to score adjustment. Most of the relevant signals belonged to the psychotropic class with benzodiazepines, antidepressants, and antipsychotics. CONCLUSIONS: Mining complex healthcare databases with statistical methods from the high-dimensional inference field may improve signal detection in pregnant women.

AB  - Pharmacovigilance involves continually monitoring drug safety after drugs are put to market. To aid this process; algorithms for the identification of strongly correlated drug/adverse drug reaction (ADR) pairs from data sources such as adverse event reporting systems or Electronic Health Records have been developed. These methods are generally statistical in nature, and do not draw upon the large volumes of knowledge embedded in the biomedical literature. In this paper, we investigate the ability of scalable Literature Based Discovery (LBD) methods to identify side effects of pharmaceutical agents. The advantage of LBD methods is that they can provide evidence from the literature to support the plausibility of a drug/ADR association, thereby assisting human review to validate the signal, which is an essential component of pharmacovigilance. To do so, we draw upon vast repositories of knowledge that has been extracted from the biomedical literature by two Natural Language Processing tools, MetaMap and SemRep. We evaluate two LBD methods that scale comfortably to the volume of knowledge available in these repositories. Specifically, we evaluate Reflective Random Indexing (RRI), a model based on concept-level co-occurrence, and Predication-based Semantic Indexing (PSI), a model that encodes the nature of the relationship between concepts to support reasoning analogically about drug-effect relationships. An evaluation set was constructed from the Side Effect Resource 2 (SIDER2), which contains known drug/ADR relations, and models were evaluated for their ability to "rediscover" these relations. In this paper, we demonstrate that both RRI and PSI can recover known drug-adverse event associations. However, PSI performed better overall, and has the additional advantage of being able to recover the literature underlying the reasoning pathways it used to make its predictions.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To develop a natural language processing system that identifies relations of medications with adverse drug events from clinical narratives. This project is part of the 2018 n2c2 challenge. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We developed a novel clinical named entity recognition method based on an recurrent convolutional neural network and compared it to a recurrent neural network implemented using the long-short term memory architecture, explored methods to integrate medical knowledge as embedding layers in neural networks, and investigated 3 machine learning models, including support vector machines, random forests and gradient boosting for relation classification. The performance of our system was evaluated using annotated data and scripts provided by the 2018 n2c2 organizers. RESULTS: Our system was among the top ranked. Our best model submitted during this challenge (based on recurrent neural networks and support vector machines) achieved lenient F1 scores of 0.9287 for concept extraction (ranked third), 0.9459 for relation classification (ranked fourth), and 0.8778 for the end-to-end relation extraction (ranked second). We developed a novel named entity recognition model based on a recurrent convolutional neural network and further investigated gradient boosting for relation classification. The new methods improved the lenient F1 scores of the 3 subtasks to 0.9292, 0.9633, and 0.8880, respectively, which are comparable to the best performance reported in this challenge. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated the feasibility of using machine learning methods to extract the relations of medications with adverse drug events from clinical narratives.

AB  - Our objective was to explore the creation of document networks based on different thresholds of shared information and different clustering algorithms on those networks to identify document clusters describing similar clinical cases. We created networks from vaccine adverse event report sets using seven approaches for linking reports. We then applied three clustering algorithms [visualization of similarities (VOS), Louvain, k-means] to these networks and evaluated their ability to identify known clusters. The report sets included one simulated set and three sets from the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System; each was split into training and testing subsets. Training subsets were used to estimate parameter values for the clustering algorithms and testing subsets to evaluate clusters. We created the networks by linking reports based on shared information in the form either of individual Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities Preferred Terms (PTs) or of dyads, triplets, quadruplets, quintuplets, and sextuplets of PTs; we created another network by weighting the single PT network connections by Lin's information theoretic approach to similarity. We then repeated this entire process using networks based on text mining output rather than structured data. We evaluated report clustering using recall, precision, and f-measure. The VOS algorithm outperformed Louvain and k-means in general. The best weighting scheme appeared to be related to the complexity of the known cluster. For example, singleton weighting performed best for an intussusception cluster driven by a single PT. We observed marginal differences between the code- and textual-based clustering. In conclusion, our approach supported identification of similar nodes in a document network.

AB  - BACKGROUND: As Twitter has become an active data source for health surveillance research, it is important that efficient and effective methods are developed to identify tweets related to personal health experience. Conventional classification algorithms rely on features engineered by human domain experts, and engineering such features is a challenging task and requires much human intelligence. The resultant features may not be optimal for the classification problem, and can make it challenging for conventional classifiers to correctly predict personal experience tweets (PETs) due to the various ways to express and/or describe personal experience in tweets. In this study, we developed a method that combines word embedding and long short-term memory (LSTM) model without the need to engineer any specific features. Through word embedding, tweet texts were represented as dense vectors which in turn were fed to the LSTM neural network as sequences. RESULTS: Statistical analyses of the results of 10-fold cross-validations of our method and conventional methods indicate that there exist significant differences (p < 0.01) in performance measures of accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC/AUC, demonstrating that our approach outperforms the conventional methods in identifying PETs. CONCLUSION: We presented an efficient and effective method of identifying health-related personal experience tweets by combining word embedding and an LSTM neural network. It is conceivable that our method can help accelerate and scale up analyzing textual data of social media for health surveillance purposes, because of no need for the laborious and costly process of engineering features.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Immune checkpoint inhibitors-induced myocarditis presents unique clinical challenges. Here, we assessed post-marketing safety of cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein-4 (CTLA-4), programmed cell death-1 (PD-1), and programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitors by mining the real-world data reported in two international pharmacovigilance databases. METHODS: We analyzed immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs)-associated fatal adverse drug events (ADEs) reports from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) collected from July 1, 2014 to December 31, 2019 and data from EudraVigilance (EV) database accessed on February 29, 2020. Three different data mining approaches were used to detect the signal of fatal myocarditis caused by ICIs. RESULTS: Based on 7613 ICIs-related ADEs reported to the EV database and 5786 ICIs-associated ADEs submitted to the FAERS database, the most frequently reported ADE was ipilimumab-related colitis. For myocarditis, nivolumab-associated myocarditis was the most common. Among the five fatal toxic effects associated with ICIs, the lethality rate of myocarditis was the highest. Therefore, we further analyzed ICI-associated myocarditis and found that elderly patients and male patients were more likely to develop ICIs-related myocarditis. The results of signal detection showed that the risk signal of avelumab-related myocarditis detected by reporting odds ratio (ROR) method and proportional reporting ratios (PRR) method was the highest, whereas the signal strength of ipilimumab-related myocarditis detected by Bayesian confidence propagation neural networks (BCPNN) method was the strongest. CONCLUSION: The findings of this study indicated the potential safety issues of developing myocarditis when using ICIs, which were consistent with the results of previous clinical trials and could provide a reference for clinical workers when using ICIs.

AB  - Backgrounds: Immune-related adverse events were reported in patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). However, with the increasing number of immune-related adverse events (irAEs), the differences of each immune checkpoint inhibitor regimen had not been fully assessed. Methods: Disproportionality analysis was used in data mining of the suspected adverse events after ICIs administration based on the Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) from January 2004 to December 2019. The onset time and fatality proportion of ICI-associated irAEs were further evaluated. Results: A total of 32,441 reports of ICI-associated irAEs were gathered. This study showed that all ICI regimens generated lung toxicity and endocrine toxicity signals. Colitis, pneumonitis and interstitial lung disease were the most common ICI-associated irAEs. Five regimens including durvalumab monotherapy, ipilimumab monotherapy, ipilimumab plus nivolumab, ipilimumab plus pembrolizumab, durvalumab plus tremelimumab were associated with irAEs. Anti-PD-1 agents generated more signals of ocular toxicities than anti-PD-L1 agents, while anti-PD-L1 agents reported more signals of hematologic toxicities. Anti-CTLA-4 agents showed more signals of gastrointestinal toxicities compared with anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 agents. The highest fatality proportion of lung toxicities with durvalumab monotherapy, hematological toxicities with avelumab monotherapy, renal and skin toxicities with cemiplimab monotherapy were found. Conclusion: Our results demonstrated that each ICI regimen had different characteristics of irAEs. Pembrolizumab had the highest fatality proportion. Ipilimumab plus pembrolizumab had the shortest median time to onset irAEs. Further studies were expected to assess whether there were clinically relevant differences exist among ICIs.

AB  - Automated signal generation is a growing field in pharmacovigilance that relies on data mining of huge spontaneous reporting systems for detecting unknown adverse drug reactions (ADR). Previous implementations of quantitative techniques did not take into account issues related to the medical dictionary for regulatory activities (MedDRA) terminology used for coding ADRs. MedDRA is a first generation terminology lacking formal definitions; grouping of similar medical conditions is not accurate due to taxonomic limitations. Our objective was to build a data-mining tool that improves signal detection algorithms by performing terminological reasoning on MedDRA codes described with the DAML+OIL description logic. We propose the PharmaMiner tool that implements quantitative techniques based on underlying statistical and bayesian models. It is a JAVA application displaying results in tabular format and performing terminological reasoning with the Racer inference engine. The mean frequency of drug-adverse effect associations in the French database was 2.66. Subsumption reasoning based on MedDRA taxonomical hierarchy produced a mean number of occurrence of 2.92 versus 3.63 (p < 0.001) obtained with a combined technique using subsumption and approximate matching reasoning based on the ontological structure. Semantic integration of terminological systems with data mining methods is a promising technique for improving machine learning in medical databases.

AB  - Computational strategies play a vital role in the prediction of adverse drug events (ADEs) owing to their low cost and increased efficiency. In this study, we used the strengths of the Jaccard and Adamic-Adar indices to build feature fusion-based predictive network models (FFPNMs) with three different machine learning (ML) methods respectively to predict drug-ADE associations. Our FFPNM with the logistic regression (LR) model improved to an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) value of 0.849, while the corresponding AUROC values for the pharmacological network model (PNM) and model based on similarity measures were 0.824 and 0.821, respectively. FFPNM with random forest (RF) is the best model among them with an AUROC value of 0.856, and the performance of FFPNM with SVM is close to that of FFPNM with RF and higher than that of FFPNM with LR. In these models, the bipartite network consisted of 152 drugs and 633 ADEs, which were obtained from the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) 2010 dataset. To better evaluate the performance of FFPNMs, we performed model predictions by different network consisting of 1177 drugs and 97 ADEs which were from the data of the first 120 days of FAERS 2004. FFPNM with RF achieved the best predictive result with AUROC value of 0.913. The results show that FFPNMs with ML methods, specially RF, have a superior prediction performance and robustness using only the topology features of the drug-ADE network. From our findings, the optimal, concise, and efficient models as computational methods for drug-ADE association predictions, were revealed.

AB  - Severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs), such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis and drug-induced hypersensitivity syndrome, are rare and occasionally fatal. However, it is difficult to detect SCARs at the drug development stage, necessitating a new approach for prediction. Therefore, in this study, using the chemical structure information of SCAR-causative drugs from the Japanese Adverse Drug Event Report (JADER) database, we tried to develop a predictive classification model of SCAR through deep learning. In the JADER database from 2004 to 2017, we defined 185 SCAR-positive drugs and 195 SCAR-negative drugs using proportional reporting ratios as the signal detection method, and the total number of reports. These SCAR-positive and SCAR-negative drugs were randomly divided into the training dataset for model construction and the test dataset for evaluation. The model performance was evaluated in the independent test dataset inside the applicability domain (AD), which is the chemical space for reliable prediction results. Using the deep learning model with molecular descriptors as the drug structure information, the area under the curve was 0.76 for the 148 drugs of the test dataset inside the AD. The method developed in the present study allows for utilizing the JADER database for SCAR classification, with potential to improve screening efficiency in the development of new drugs. This method may also help to noninvasively identify the causative drug, and help assess the causality between drugs and SCARs in postmarketing surveillance.

AB  - Background: T ransformer-based language models have delivered clear improvements in a wide range of natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, those models have a significant limitation; specifically, they cannot infer causality, a prerequisite for deployment in pharmacovigilance, and health care. Therefore, these transformer-based language models should be developed to infer causality to address the key question of the cause of a clinical outcome. Results: In this study, we propose an innovative causal inference model-InferBERT, by integrating the A Lite Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (ALBERT) and Judea Pearl's Do-calculus to establish potential causality in pharmacovigilance. Two FDA Adverse Event Reporting System case studies, including Analgesics-related acute liver failure and Tramadol-related mortalities, were employed to evaluate the proposed InferBERT model. The InferBERT model yielded accuracies of 0.78 and 0.95 for identifying Analgesics-related acute liver failure and Tramadol-related death cases, respectively. Meanwhile, the inferred causes of the two clinical outcomes, (i.e. acute liver failure and death) were highly consistent with clinical knowledge. Furthermore, inferred causes were organized into a causal tree using the proposed recursive do-calculus algorithm to improve the model's understanding of causality. Moreover, the high reproducibility of the proposed InferBERT model was demonstrated by a robustness assessment. Conclusion: The empirical results demonstrated that the proposed InferBERT approach is able to both predict clinical events and to infer their causes. Overall, the proposed InferBERT model is a promising approach to establish causal effects behind text-based observational data to enhance our understanding of intrinsic causality. Availability and implementation: The InferBERT model and preprocessed FAERS data sets are available on GitHub at https://github.com/XingqiaoWang/DeepCausalPV-master.

AB  - Clinical judgment studies are an integral part of drug safety surveillance and pharmacovigilance frameworks. They help quantify the causal relationship between medication and its adverse drug reactions (ADRs). To conduct such studies, physicians need to review patients' charts manually to answer Naranjo questionnaire(1). In this paper, we propose a methodology to automatically infer causal relations from patients' discharge summaries by combining the capabilities of deep learning and statistical learning models. We use Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT)(2) to extract relevant paragraphs for each Naranjo question and then use a statistical learning model such as logistic regression to predict the Naranjo score and the causal relation between the medication and an ADR. Our methodology achieves a macro-averaged f1-score of 0.50 and weighted f1-score of 0.63.

AB  - Purpose: To compare the results of drug safety data mining with three different algorithms, when adverse events are identified using MedDRA11MedDRA® is a registered trademark of the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Associations (IFPMA). Preferred Terms (PT) vs. High Level Terms (HLT) vs. Standardised MedDRA Queries (SMQ). Methods: For a representative set of 26 drugs, data from the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (AERS) database from 2001 through 2005 was mined for signals of disproportionate reporting (SDRs) using three different data mining algorithms (DMAs): the Gamma Poisson Shrinker (GPS), the urn-model algorithm (URN), and the proportional reporting rate (PRR) algorithm. Results were evaluated using a previously described Reference Event Database (RED) which contains documented drug-event associations for the 26 drugs. Analysis emphasized the percentage of SDRs in the "unlabeled supported" category, corresponding to those adverse events that were not described in the U.S. prescribing information for the drug at the time of its approval, but which were supported by some published evidence for an association with the drug. Results: Based on a logistic regression analysis, the percentage of unlabeled supported SDRs was smallest at the PT level, intermediate at the HLT level, and largest at the SMQ level, for all three algorithms. The GPS and URN methods detected comparable percentages of unlabeled supported SDRs while the PRR method detected a smaller percentage, at all three MedDRA levels. No evidence of a method/level interaction was seen. Conclusions: Use of HLT and SMQ groupings can improve the percentage of unlabeled supported SDRs in data mining results. The trade-off for this gain is the medically less-specific language of HLTs and SMQs compared to PTs, and the need for the added step in data mining of examining the component PTs of each HLT or SMQ that results in a signal of disproportionate reporting. © 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

We conducted supervised experiments on a subset of messages annotated by experts according to positive or negative misuse; results ranged from 0.62 to 0.91 of F-score. We also annotated both SPCs and another set of posts to compare MedDRA annotations in each source. A pharmacovigilance expert checked the output and confirmed that entities not found in SCPs might express drug misuse or unknown ADRs.

AB  - Automation of pharmaceutical safety case processing represents a significant opportunity to affect the strongest cost driver for a company's overall pharmacovigilance budget. A pilot was undertaken to test the feasibility of using artificial intelligence and robotic process automation to automate processing of adverse event reports. The pilot paradigm was used to simultaneously test proposed solutions of three commercial vendors. The result confirmed the feasibility of using artificial intelligence-based technology to support extraction from adverse event source documents and evaluation of case validity. In addition, the pilot demonstrated viability of the use of safety database data fields as a surrogate for otherwise time-consuming and costly direct annotation of source documents. Finally, the evaluation and scoring method used in the pilot was able to differentiate vendor capabilities and identify the best candidate to move into the discovery phase.

AB  - Clinical drug-drug interactions (DDIs) have been a major cause for not only medical error but also adverse drug events (ADEs). The published literature on DDI clinical toxicity continues to grow significantly, and high-performance DDI information retrieval (IR) text mining methods are in high demand. The effectiveness of IR and its machine learning (ML) algorithm depends on the availability of a large amount of training and validation data that have been manually reviewed and annotated. In this study, we investigated how active learning (AL) might improve ML performance in clinical safety DDI IR analysis. We recognized that a direct application of AL would not address several primary challenges in DDI IR from the literature. For instance, the vast majority of abstracts in PubMed will be negative, existing positive and negative labeled samples do not represent the general sample distributions, and potentially biased samples may arise during uncertainty sampling in an AL algorithm. Therefore, we developed several novel sampling and ML schemes to improve AL performance in DDI IR analysis. In particular, random negative sampling was added as a part of AL since it has no expanse in the manual data label. We also used two ML algorithms in an AL process to differentiate random negative samples from manually labeled negative samples, and updated both the training and validation samples during the AL process to avoid or reduce biased sampling. Two supervised ML algorithms, support vector machine (SVM) and logistic regression (LR), were used to investigate the consistency of our proposed AL algorithm. Because the ultimate goal of clinical safety DDI IR is to retrieve all DDI toxicity-relevant abstracts, a recall rate of 0.99 was set in developing the AL methods. When we used our newly proposed AL method with SVM, the precision in differentiating the positive samples from manually labeled negative samples improved from 0.45 in the first round to 0.83 in the second round, and the precision in differentiating the positive samples from random negative samples improved from 0.70 to 0.82 in the first and second rounds, respectively. When our proposed AL method was used with LR, the improvements in precision followed a similar trend. However, the other AL algorithms tested did not show improved precision largely because of biased samples caused by the uncertainty sampling or differences between training and validation data sets.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Many healthcare providers have implemented patient safety event reporting systems to better understand and improve patient safety. Reviewing and analyzing these reports is often time consuming and resource intensive because of both the quantity of reports and length of free-text descriptions in the reports. METHODS: Natural language processing (NLP) experts collaborated with clinical experts on a patient safety committee to assist in the identification and analysis of medication related patient safety events. Different NLP algorithmic approaches were developed to identify four types of medication related patient safety events and the models were compared. RESULTS: Well performing NLP models were generated to categorize medication related events into pharmacy delivery delays, dispensing errors, Pyxis discrepancies, and prescriber errors with receiver operating characteristic areas under the curve of 0.96, 0.87, 0.96, and 0.81 respectively. We also found that modeling the brief without the resolution text generally improved model performance. These models were integrated into a dashboard visualization to support the patient safety committee review process. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate the capabilities of various NLP models and the use of two text inclusion strategies at categorizing medication related patient safety events. The NLP models and visualization could be used to improve the efficiency of patient safety event data review and analysis.

AB  - Purpose: Voltage-gated sodium channels (VGSCs) are drug targets for the treatment of epilepsy. Recently, a decreased risk of cancer associated with sodium channel-blocking antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) has become a research focus of interest. The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that the use of sodium channel-blocking AEDs are inversely associated with cancer, using different methodologies, algorithms, and databases. Methods: A total of 65,146,507 drug-reaction pairs from the first quarter of 2004 through the end of 2013 were downloaded from the US Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System. The reporting odds ratio (ROR) and information component (IC) were used to detect an inverse association between AEDs and cancer. Upper limits of the 95% confidence interval (CI) of < 1 and < 0 for the ROR and IC, respectively, signified inverse associations. Furthermore, using a claims database, which contains 3 million insured persons, an event sequence symmetry analysis (ESSA) was performed to identify an inverse association between AEDs and cancer over the period of January 2005 to May 2014. The upper limit of the 95% CI of adjusted sequence ratio (ASR) < 1 signified an inverse association. Results: In the FAERS database analyses, significant inverse associations were found between sodium channel-blocking AEDs and individual cancers. In the claims database analyses, sodium channel-blocking AED use was inversely associated with diagnoses of colorectal cancer, lung cancer, gastric cancer, and hematological malignancies, with ASRs of 0.72 (95% CI: 0.60 – 0.86), 0.65 (0.51 – 0.81), 0.80 (0.65 – 0.98), and 0.50 (0.37 – 0.66), respectively. Positive associations between sodium channel-blocking AEDs and cancer were not found in the study. Conclusion: Multi-methodological approaches using different methodologies, algorithms, and databases suggest that sodium channel-blocking AED use is inversely associated with colorectal cancer, lung cancer, gastric cancer, and hematological malignancies.

AB  - PURPOSE: Pegloticase-associated adverse events reported to the Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database in the United States were evaluated. METHODS: Retrospective data-mining analysis of FAERS case reports listing Krystexxa or pegloticase as the suspect drug and specific adverse events (cardiovascular events, infusion-related reactions, gout flares, and anaphylaxis) was conducted from the drug's approval date (September 14, 2010) through August 27, 2012. Initial and follow-up reports with the same primary linked identification number were identified as unique to each patient case. When multiple reports for the same patient were identified with a common case number, the report with the most recent date was used to eliminate duplicate reports. Bayesian confidence propagation neural network methodology was used to identify signals of drug-associated adverse events. A potential signal for drug-adverse event reports is generated when the lower limit of the 95% two-sided confidence interval of the information component is greater than 0. RESULTS: A total of 118 unique cases of adverse events involving pegloticase in the United States were identified during the study period. Fourteen reports were related to pegloticase-associated cardiovascular events, and 35 were related to pegloticase-associated infusion-related reactions. Twenty-six reports were related to pegloticase-associated gout, and 11 were reports of pegloticase-associated anaphylaxis. Bayesian statistics identified potential signals for all pegloticase-associated adverse events (cardiovascular events, infusion reactions, gout flares, and anaphylaxis). CONCLUSION: Analysis of pegloticase-associated adverse events submitted to the FAERS database found that cardiovascular events, infusion-related reactions, gout flares, and anaphylaxis occurred more frequently than was statistically expected.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: We aim to evaluate the effectiveness of advanced deep learning models (eg, capsule network [CapNet], adversarial training [ADV]) for single-domain and multidomain relation extraction from electronic health record (EHR) notes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We built multiple deep learning models with increased complexity, namely a multilayer perceptron (MLP) model and a CapNet model for single-domain relation extraction and fully shared (FS), shared-private (SP), and adversarial training (ADV) modes for multidomain relation extraction. Our models were evaluated in 2 ways: first, we compared our models using our expert-annotated cancer (the MADE1.0 corpus) and cardio corpora; second, we compared our models with the systems in the MADE1.0 and i2b2 challenges. RESULTS: Multidomain models outperform single-domain models by 0.7%-1.4% in F1 (t test P < .05), but the results of FS, SP, and ADV modes are mixed. Our results show that the MLP model generally outperforms the CapNet model by 0.1%-1.0% in F1. In the comparisons with other systems, the CapNet model achieves the state-of-the-art result (87.2% in F1) in the cancer corpus and the MLP model generally outperforms MedEx in the cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and i2b2 corpora. CONCLUSIONS: Our MLP or CapNet model generally outperforms other state-of-the-art systems in medication and adverse drug event relation extraction. Multidomain models perform better than single-domain models. However, neither the SP nor the ADV mode can always outperform the FS mode significantly. Moreover, the CapNet model is not superior to the MLP model for our corpora.

AB  - The development of novel drugs in response to changing clinical requirements is a complex and costly method with uncertain outcomes. Postmarket pharmacovigilance is essential as drugs often have under-reported side effects. This study intends to use the power of digital media to discover the under-reported side effects of marketed drugs. We have collected tweets for 11 different Drugs (Alprazolam, Adderall, Fluoxetine, Venlafaxine, Adalimumab, Lamotrigine, Quetiapine, Trazodone, Paroxetine, Metronidazole and Miconazole). We have compiled a vast adverse drug reactions (ADRs) lexicon that is used to filter health related data. We constructed machine learning models for automatically annotating the huge amount of publicly available Twitter data. Our results show that on average 43 known ADRs are shared between Twitter and FAERS datasets. Moreover, we were able to recover on average 7 known side effects from Twitter data that are not reported on FAERS. Our results on Twitter dataset show a high concordance with FAERS, Medeffect and Drugs.com. Moreover, we manually validated some of the under-reported side effect predicted by our model using literature search. Common known and under-reported side effects can be found at https://github.com/cbrl-nuces/Leveraging-digital-media-data-for-pharmacovigilance.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Adverse drug events (ADEs) constitute one of the leading causes of post-therapeutic death and their identification constitutes an important challenge of modern precision medicine. Unfortunately, the onset and effects of ADEs are often underreported complicating timely intervention. At over 500 million posts per day, Twitter is a commonly used social media platform. The ubiquity of day-to-day personal information exchange on Twitter makes it a promising target for data mining for ADE identification and intervention. Three technical challenges are central to this problem: (1) identification of salient medical keywords in (noisy) tweets, (2) mapping drug-effect relationships, and (3) classification of such relationships as adverse or non-adverse. METHODS: We use a bipartite graph-theoretic representation called a drug-effect graph (DEG) for modeling drug and side effect relationships by representing the drugs and side effects as vertices. We construct individual DEGs on two data sources. The first DEG is constructed from the drug-effect relationships found in FDA package inserts as recorded in the SIDER database. The second DEG is constructed by mining the history of Twitter users. We use dictionary-based information extraction to identify medically-relevant concepts in tweets. Drugs, along with co-occurring symptoms are connected with edges weighted by temporal distance and frequency. Finally, information from the SIDER DEG is integrate with the Twitter DEG and edges are classified as either adverse or non-adverse using supervised machine learning. RESULTS: We examine both graph-theoretic and semantic features for the classification task. The proposed approach can identify adverse drug effects with high accuracy with precision exceeding 85 % and F1 exceeding 81 %. When compared with leading methods at the state-of-the-art, which employ un-enriched graph-theoretic analysis alone, our method leads to improvements ranging between 5 and 8 % in terms of the aforementioned measures. Additionally, we employ our method to discover several ADEs which, though present in medical literature and Twitter-streams, are not represented in the SIDER databases. CONCLUSIONS: We present a DEG integration model as a powerful formalism for the analysis of drug-effect relationships that is general enough to accommodate diverse data sources, yet rigorous enough to provide a strong mechanism for ADE identification.

AB  - The World Health Organization underlines the significance of adverse drug reaction (ADR) reports for patients' safety. Actually, many potential ADRs tend to be under-reported in post-market ADR surveillance. Recognizing ADRs from social media is indispensably important and could complement post-market ADR surveillance for more effective pharmacovigilance studies. However, previous approaches pose two challenges: 1) ADRs show high expression variability in social media, and thus, many potential ADRs are out-of-lexicon ones, which are difficult to be recognized, and 2) most phrasal ADRs are non-standard mentions and their boundaries are difficult to identify accurately. To tackle these challenges, we design three interaction graphs and propose a neural network approach, i.e., Interaction Graph Network (IGN). Specifically, to recognize more out-of-lexicon ADRs, besides the mentions in ADR lexicon, noun phrases in the input sentence are regarded as candidate phrases and their features are taken into considerations. Moreover, in an attempt to accurately identify ADR boundaries, three word-phrase interaction graphs are designed to represent lexicon knowledge and are encoded using graph attention networks (GATs) to directly integrate various boundary and contextual information of candidate phrases into ADR recognition. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets show that IGN can recognize ADR accurately and consistently outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches.

AB  - Because of contradictory evidence from clinical trials, the association between angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and lung cancer needs further evaluation. As such, the current study is to assess disproportionate reporting of primary malignant lung cancer among reports for ACEIs submitted to the FDA adverse event reporting system utilizing a pharmacovigilance approach. We conducted a disproportionality analysis of primary malignant lung cancer adverse events associated with 10 ACEIs by calculating the reported odds ratios (ROR) and information component (IC) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). ROR was adjusted for sex, age, and reporting year by logistic regression analyses. From January 2004 to March 2020, a total of 622 cases of lung cancer adverse event reports were identified for ACEIs users. Significant disproportionate association was found for ACEIs as a drug class (ROR: 1.22, 95% CI: 1.13–1.32; IC: 0.28, 95% CI: 0.17–0.39. adjusted ROR: 1.23, 95% CI: 1.02–1.49). After stratification based on gender, a subset analysis suggested that female patients exhibited a significant disproportionate association, while male patients did not. Sensitivity analyses that limited the data by reporting region, comorbidity, and reporting year also showed similar trends. Statistical significant lung cancer signals were detected among patients who received ACEI, especially female patients. The disproportionality analysis of the FAERS database suggests mildly increased reporting of lung cancer among ACEI users. Further robust epidemiological studies are necessary to confirm this relationship.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Vaccine safety surveillance is important because it is related to vaccine hesitancy, which affects vaccination rate. To increase confidence in vaccination, the active monitoring of vaccine adverse events is important. For effective active surveillance, we developed and verified a machine learning-based active surveillance system using national claim data. METHODS: We used two databases, one from the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency, which contains flu vaccination records for the elderly, and another from the National Health Insurance Service, which contains the claim data of vaccinated people. We developed a case-crossover design based machine learning model to predict the health outcome of interest events (anaphylaxis and agranulocytosis) using a random forest. Feature importance values were evaluated to determine candidate associations with each outcome. We investigated the relationship of the features to each event via a literature review, comparison with the Side Effect Resource, and using the Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanation method. RESULTS: The trained model predicted each health outcome of interest with a high accuracy (approximately 70%). We found literature supporting our results, and most of the important drug-related features were listed in the Side Effect Resource database as inducing the health outcome of interest. For anaphylaxis, flu vaccination ranked high in our feature importance analysis and had a positive association in Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanation analysis. Although the feature importance of vaccination was lower for agranulocytosis, it also had a positive relationship in the Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanation analysis. CONCLUSION: We developed a machine learning-based active surveillance system for detecting possible factors that can induce adverse events using health claim and vaccination databases. The results of the study demonstrated a potentially useful application of two linked national health record databases. Our model can contribute to the establishment of a system for conducting active surveillance on vaccination.

Objective: To evaluate the feasibility of machine learning algorithms in detecting ADR signals of nivolumab and docetaxel, new and old anticancer agents. Methods: We conducted a safety surveillance study of nivolumab and docetaxel using the Korea national spontaneous reporting database from 2009 to 2018. We constructed a novel input dataset for each study drug comprised of known ADRs that were listed in the drug labels and unknown ADRs. Given the known ADRs, we trained machine learning algorithms and evaluated predictive performance in generating safety signals of machine learning algorithms (gradient boosting machine [GBM] and random forest [RF]) compared with traditional disproportionality analysis methods (reporting odds ratio [ROR] and information component [IC]) by using the area under the curve (AUC). Each method then was implemented to detect new safety signals from the unknown ADR datasets. Results: Of all methods implemented, GBM achieved the best average predictive performance (AUC: 0.97 and 0.93 for nivolumab and docetaxel). The AUC achieved by each method was 0.95 and 0.92 (RF), 0.55 and 0.51 (ROR), and 0.49 and 0.48 (IC) for respective drug. GBM detected additional 24 and nine signals for nivolumab and 82 and 76 for docetaxel compared to ROR and IC, respectively, from the unknown ADR datasets. Conclusion: Machine learning algorithm based on GBM performed better and detected more new ADR signals than traditional disproportionality analysis methods.

AB  - Drug-drug interactions account for up to 30% of adverse drug reactions. Increasing prevalence of electronic health records (EHRs) offers a unique opportunity to build machine learning algorithms to identify drug-drug interactions that drive adverse events. In this study, we investigated hospitalizations' data to study drug interactions with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) that result in drug-induced liver injury (DILI). We propose a logistic regression based machine learning algorithm that unearths several known interactions from an EHR dataset of about 400,000 hospitalization. Our proposed modeling framework is successful in detecting 87.5% of the positive controls, which are defined by drugs known to interact with diclofenac causing an increased risk of DILI, and correctly ranks aggregate risk of DILI for eight commonly prescribed NSAIDs. We found that our modeling framework is particularly successful in inferring associations of drug-drug interactions from relatively small EHR datasets. Furthermore, we have identified a novel and potentially hepatotoxic interaction that might occur during concomitant use of meloxicam and esomeprazole, which are commonly prescribed together to allay NSAID-induced gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding. Empirically, we validate our approach against prior methods for signal detection on EHR datasets, in which our proposed approach outperforms all the compared methods across most metrics, such as area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC).

AB  - BACKGROUND: The importance of identifying and evaluating adverse drug reactions (ADRs) has been widely recognized. Many studies have developed algorithms for ADR signal detection using electronic health record (EHR) data. In this study, we propose a machine learning (ML) model that enables accurate ADR signal detection by integrating features from existing algorithms based on inpatient EHR laboratory results. MATERIALS AND METHODS: To construct an ADR reference dataset, we extracted known drug-laboratory event pairs represented by a laboratory test from the EU-SPC and SIDER databases. All possible drug-laboratory event pairs, except known ones, are considered unknown. To detect a known drug-laboratory event pair, three existing algorithms-CERT, CLEAR, and PACE-were applied to 21-year inpatient EHR data. We also constructed ML models (based on random forest, L1 regularized logistic regression, support vector machine, and a neural network) that use the intermediate products of the CERT, CLEAR, and PACE algorithms as inputs and determine whether a drug-laboratory event pair is associated. For performance comparison, we evaluated the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), F1-measure, and area under receiver operating characteristic (AUROC). RESULTS: All measures of ML models outperformed those of existing algorithms with sensitivity of 0.593-0.793, specificity of 0.619-0.796, NPV of 0.645-0.727, PPV of 0.680-0.777, F1-measure of 0.629-0.709, and AUROC of 0.737-0.816. Features related to change or distribution of shape were considered important for detecting ADR signals. CONCLUSIONS: Improved performance of ML models indicated that applying our model to EHR data is feasible and promising for detecting more accurate and comprehensive ADR signals.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Adverse drug reaction (ADR) detection in hospitals is heavily reliant on spontaneous reporting by clinical staff, with studies in the literature pointing to high rates of underreporting [1]. International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10) codes have been used in epidemiological studies of ADRs and offer the potential for automated ADR detection systems. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to develop an automated ADR detection system based on ICD-10 codes, using machine-learning algorithms to improve accuracy and efficiency. METHODS: For a 12-month period from December 2016 to November 2017, every inpatient episode receiving an ICD-10 code in the range Y40.0-Y59.9 (ADR code) was flagged for review as a potential ADR. Each flagged admission was assessed by an expert pharmacist and, if needed, reviewed at regular ADR committee meetings. For each report, a determination was made about ADR probability and severity. The dataset was randomly split into training and test sets. A machine-learning model using the random forest algorithm was developed on the training set to discriminate between true and false ADR reports. The model was then applied to the test set to assess accuracy using the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUC). RESULTS: In the study period, 2917 Y40.0-Y59.9 codes were applied to admissions, resulting in 245 ADR reports after review. These 245 reports accounted for 44.5% of all ADR reporting in our hospital in the study period. A random forest model built on the training set was able to discriminate between true and false reports on the test set with an AUC of 0.803. CONCLUSIONS: Automated ADR detection using ICD-10 coding significantly improved ADR detection in the study period, with improved discrimination between true and false reports by applying a machine-learning model.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Early detection of adverse drug events (ADEs) from electronic health records is an important, challenging task to support pharmacovigilance and drug safety surveillance. A well-known challenge to use clinical text for detection of ADEs is that much of the detailed information is documented in a narrative manner. Clinical natural language processing (NLP) is the key technology to extract information from unstructured clinical text. OBJECTIVE: We present a machine learning-based clinical NLP system-MADEx-for detecting medications, ADEs, and their relations from clinical notes. METHODS: We developed a recurrent neural network (RNN) model using a long short-term memory (LSTM) strategy for clinical name entity recognition (NER) and compared it with baseline conditional random fields (CRFs). We also developed a modified training strategy for the RNN, which outperformed the widely used early stop strategy. For relation extraction, we compared support vector machines (SVMs) and random forests on single-sentence relations and cross-sentence relations. In addition, we developed an integrated pipeline to extract entities and relations together by combining RNNs and SVMs. RESULTS: MADEx achieved the top-three best performances (F1 score of 0.8233) for clinical NER in the 2018 Medication and Adverse Drug Events (MADE1.0) challenge. The post-challenge evaluation showed that the relation extraction module and integrated pipeline (identify entity and relation together) of MADEx are comparable with the best systems developed in this challenge. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated the efficiency of deep learning methods for automatic extraction of medications, ADEs, and their relations from clinical text to support pharmacovigilance and drug safety surveillance.

AB  - We develop a simple statistic for comparing rates of rare adverse events between treatment groups in postmarketing safety studies where the events have uncertain status. In this setting, the statistic is asymptotically equivalent to the logrank statistic, but the limiting distribution has Poisson and binomial components instead of being Gaussian. We develop two new procedures for computing critical values: a Gaussian approximation and a parametric bootstrap. Both numerical and asymptotic properties of the procedures are studied. The test procedures are demonstrated on a postmarketing safety study of the RotaTeq vaccine. This vaccine was developed to reduce the incidence of severe diarrhea in infants. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Purpose: The objective of our study was to conduct a data mining analysis to identify potential adverse events (AEs) following MENACWY-D using the tree-temporal scan statistic in the Vaccine Safety Datalink population and demonstrate the feasibility of this method in a large distributed safety data setting. Methods: Traditional pharmacovigilance techniques used in vaccine safety are generally geared to detecting AEs based on pre-defined sets of conditions or diagnoses. Using a newly developed tree-temporal scan statistic data mining method, we performed a pilot study to evaluate the safety profile of the meningococcal conjugate vaccine Menactra® (MenACWY-D), screening thousands of potential AE diagnoses and diagnosis groupings. The study cohort included enrolled participants in the Vaccine Safety Datalink aged 11 to 18 years who had received MenACWY-D vaccination(s) between 2005 and 2014. The tree-temporal scan statistic was employed to identify statistical associations (signals) of AEs following MENACWY-D at a 0.05 level of significance, adjusted for multiple testing. Results: We detected signals for 2 groups of outcomes: diseases of the skin and subcutaneous tissue, fever, and urticaria. Both groups are known AEs following MENACWY-D vaccination. We also identified a statistical signal for pleurisy, but further examination suggested it was likely a false signal. No new MENACWY-D safety concerns were raised. Conclusions: As a pilot study, we demonstrated that the tree-temporal scan statistic data mining method can be successfully applied to screen broadly for a wide range of vaccine-AE associations within a large health care data network.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Adverse drug events (ADEs) are undesired harmful effects resulting from use of a medication, and occur in 30% of hospitalized patients. The authors have developed a data-mining method for systematic, automated detection of ADEs from electronic medical records. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This method uses the text from 9.5 million clinical notes, along with prior knowledge of drug usages and known ADEs, as inputs. These inputs are further processed into statistics used by a discriminative classifier which outputs the probability that a given drug-disorder pair represents a valid ADE association. Putative ADEs identified by the classifier are further filtered for positive support in 2 independent, complementary data sources. The authors evaluate this method by assessing support for the predictions in other curated data sources, including a manually curated, time-indexed reference standard of label change events. RESULTS: This method uses a classifier that achieves an area under the curve of 0.94 on a held out test set. The classifier is used on 2,362,950 possible drug-disorder pairs comprised of 1602 unique drugs and 1475 unique disorders for which we had data, resulting in 240 high-confidence, well-supported drug-AE associations. Eighty-seven of them (36%) are supported in at least one of the resources that have information that was not available to the classifier. CONCLUSION: This method demonstrates the feasibility of systematic post-marketing surveillance for ADEs using electronic medical records, a key component of the learning healthcare system.

PD  - Oct
AB  - Background: Adverse Drug Reactions are one of the leading causes of injury or death among patients undergoing medical treatments. Not all Adverse Drug Reactions are identified before a drug is made available in the market. Current post-marketing drug surveillance methods, which are based purely on voluntary spontaneous reports, are unable to provide the early indications necessary to prevent the occurrence of such injuries or fatalities. The objective of this research is to extract reports of adverse drug side-effects from messages in online healthcare forums and use them as early indicators to assist in post-marketing drug surveillance. Methods: We treat the task of extracting adverse side-effects of drugs from healthcare forum messages as a sequence labeling problem and present a Hidden Markov Model(HMM) based Text Mining system that can be used to classify a message as containing drug side-effect information and then extract the adverse side-effect mentions from it. A manually annotated dataset from www. medications. com is used in the training and validation of the HMM based Text Mining system. Results: A 10-fold cross-validation on the manually annotated dataset yielded on average an F-Score of 0.76 from the HMM Classifier, in comparison to 0.575 from the Baseline classifier. Without the Plain Text Filter component as a part of the Text Processing module, the F-Score of the HMM Classifier was reduced to 0.378 on average, while absence of the HTML Filter component was found to have no impact. Reducing the Drug names dictionary size by half, on average reduced the F-Score of the HMM Classifier to 0.359, while a similar reduction to the side-effects dictionary yielded an F-Score of 0.651 on average. Adverse side-effects mined from www. medications. com and www. steadyhealth. com were found to match the Adverse Drug Reactions on the Drug Package Labels of several drugs. In addition, some novel adverse side-effects, which can be potential Adverse Drug Reactions, were also identified. Conclusions: The results from the HMM based Text Miner are encouraging to pursue further enhancements to this approach. The mined novel side-effects can act as early indicators for health authorities to help focus their efforts in post-marketing drug surveillance.

AB  - Background and objectives: Pharmacovigilance (PhV) is an important clinical activity with strong implications for population health and clinical research. The main goal of PhV is the timely detection of adverse drug events (ADEs) that are novel in their clinical nature, severity and/or frequency. Drug interactions (DI) pose an important problem in the development of new drugs and post marketing PhV that contribute to 6-30% of all unexpected ADEs. Therefore, the early detection of DI is vital. Spontaneous reporting systems (SRS) have served as the core data collection system for post marketing PhV since the 1960s. The main objective of our study was to particularly identify signals of DI from SRS. In addition, we are presenting an optimized tailored mining algorithm called "hybrid Apriori". Methods: The proposed algorithm is based on an optimized and modified association rule mining (ARM) approach. A hybrid Apriori algorithm has been applied to the SRS of the United States Food and Drug Administration's (U.S. FDA) adverse events reporting system (FAERS) in order to extract significant association patterns of drug interaction-adverse event (DIAE). We have assessed the resulting DIAEs qualitatively and quantitatively using two different triage features: a three-element taxonomy and three performance metrics. These features were applied on two random samples of 100 interacting and 100 non-interacting DIAE patterns. Additionally, we have employed logistic regression (LR) statistic method to quantify the magnitude and direction of interactions in order to test for confounding by co-medication in unknown interacting DIAE patterns. Results: Hybrid Apriori extracted 2933 interacting DIAE patterns (including 1256 serious ones) and 530 non-interacting DIAE patterns. Referring to the current knowledge using four different reliable resources of DI, the results showed that the proposed method can extract signals of serious interacting DIAEs. Various association patterns could be identified based on the relationships among the elements which composed a pattern. The average performance of the method showed 85% precision, 80% negative predictive value, 81% sensitivity and 84% specificity. The LR modeling could provide the statistical context to guard against spurious DIAEs. Conclusions: The proposed method could efficiently detect DIAE signals from SRS data as well as, identifying rare adverse drug reactions (ADRs).

AB  - Mining high-order drug-drug interaction (DDI) induced adverse drug effects from electronic health record databases is an emerging area, and very few studies have explored the relationships between high-order drug combinations. We investigate a novel pharmacovigilance problem for mining directional DDI effects on myopathy using the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database. Our paper provides information on the risk of myopathy associated with adding new drugs on the already prescribed medication, and visualizes the identified directional DDI patterns as user-friendly graphical representation. We utilize the Apriori algorithm to extract frequent drug combinations from the FAERS database. We use odds ratio to estimate the risk of myopathy associated with directional DDI. We create a tree-structured graph to visualize the findings for easy interpretation. Our method confirmed myopathy association with previously reported HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors like rosuvastatin, fluvastatin, simvastatin, and atorvastatin. New, previously unidentified but mechanistically plausible associations with myopathy were also observed, such as the DDI between pamidronate and levofloxacin. Additional top findings are gadolinium-based imaging agents, which however are often used in myopathy diagnosis. Other DDIs with no obvious mechanism are also reported, such as that of sulfamethoxazole with trimethoprim and potassium chloride. This study shows the feasibility to estimate high-order directional DDIs in a fast and accurate manner. The results of the analysis could become a useful tool in the specialists' hands through an easy-to-understand graphic visualization.

AB  - The pharmacovigilance databases consist of several case reports involving drugs and adverse events (AEs). Some methods are applied consistently to highlight all signals, i.e. all statistically significant associations between a drug and an AE. These methods are appropriate for verification of more complex relationships involving one or several drug(s) and AE(s) (e.g; syndromes or interactions) but do not address the identification of them. We propose a method for the extraction of these relationships based on Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) associated with disproportionality measures. This method identifies all sets of drugs and AEs which are potential signals, syndromes or interactions. Compared to a previous experience of disproportionality analysis without FCA, the addition of FCA was more efficient for identifying false positives related to concomitant drugs.

AB  - During the post-marketing period, when medicines are used by large population contingents and for longer periods, unexpected adverse events (AE) can occur, potentially altering the drug's risk-benefit ratio enough to demand regulatory action. AE are health problems that can occur during treatment with a pharmaceutical product, which in the drug's post-marketing period can require a significant increase in health care and result in unnecessary and often fatal harm to patients. Therefore, a key objective for the health system is to identify AE as soon as possible in the post-marketing period. Some countries have pharmacovigilance systems responsible for collecting voluntary reports of post-marketing AE, but studies have shown that social networks can be used to obtain more and faster reports. The current project's main objective is to build a totally automated system using Twitter as a source to detect both new and previously known AE and conduct the statistical analysis of the resulting data. A system was thus built to collect, process, analyze, and assess tweets in search of AE, comparing them to U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) data and the reference standard. The results allowed detecting new and existing AE related to the drug doxycycline, showing that Twitter can be useful in pharmacovigilance when employed jointly with other data sources.

AB  - Background: The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the United States and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) have recognized social media as a new data source to strengthen their activities regarding drug safety. Objective: Our objective in the ADR-PRISM project was to provide text mining and visualization tools to explore a corpus of posts extracted from social media. We evaluated this approach on a corpus of 21 million posts from five patient forums, and conducted a qualitative analysis of the data available on methylphenidate in this corpus. Methods: We applied text mining methods based on named entity recognition and relation extraction in the corpus, followed by signal detection using proportional reporting ratio (PRR). We also used topic modeling based on the Correlated Topic Model to obtain the list of the matics in the corpus and classify the messages based on their topics. Results: We automatically identified 3443 posts about methylphenidate published between 2007 and 2016, among which 61 adverse drug reactions (ADR) were automatically detected. Two pharmacovigilance experts evaluated manually the quality of automatic identification, and a f-measure of 0.57 was reached. Patient's reports were mainly neuro-psychiatric effects. Applying PRR, 67% of the ADRs were signals, including most of the neuro-psychiatric symptoms but also palpitations. Topic modeling showed that the most represented topics were related to Childhood and Treatment initiation, but also Side effects. Cases of misuse were also identified in this corpus, including recreational use and abuse. Conclusion: Named entity recognition combined with signal detection and topic modeling have demonstrated their complementarity in mining social media data. An in-depth analysis focused on methylphenidate showed that this approach was able to detect potential signals and to provide better understanding of patients' behaviors regarding drugs, including misuse.

AB  - Objective: Opioid-based analgesia is routinely used in clinical practice for the management of pain and alleviation of suffering at the end of life. It is well-known that opioid-based medications can be highly addictive, promoting not only abuse but also life-threatening overdoses. The scope of opioid-related adverse events (AEs) beyond these well-known effects remains poorly described. This exploratory analysis investigates potential AEs from drug-drug interactions between opioid and nonopioid medications (ODIs). Materials and Methods: In this study, we conduct an initial exploration of the association between ODIs and severe AEs using millions of AE reports available in FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS). The odds ratio (OR)-based analysis and visualization are proposed for single drugs and pairwise ODIs to identify associations between AEs and ODIs of interest. Moreover, the multilabel (multi-AE) learning models are employed to evaluate the feasibility of AE prediction of polypharmacy. Results: The top 12 most prescribed opioids in the FAERS are identified. The OR-based analysis identifies a diverse set of AEs associated with individual opioids. Moreover, the results indicate many ODIs can increase the risk of severe AEs dramatically. The area under the curve values of multilabel learning models of ODIs for oxycodone varied between 0.81 and 0.88 for 5 severe AEs. Conclusions: The proposed data analysis and visualization are useful for mining FAERS data to identify novel polypharmacy associated AEs, as shown for ODIs. This approach was successful in recapitulating known drug interactions and also identified new opioid-specific AEs that could impact prescribing practices.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Allergen immunotherapy (AIT) treatment for allergic rhinitis and asthma is used by 2.6 million Americans annually. Clinical and sterility testing studies identify no risk of contamination or infection from extracts prepared using recommended aseptic techniques, but regulatory concerns persist. Social media can be used to investigate rare adverse effects not captured by traditional studies. OBJECTIVE: We sought to investigate large social media databases for suggestion of AIT skin and soft tissue infection (SSTI) risk and compare this risk to a comparator procedure with a sterile pharmaceutical. METHODS: We analyzed US-restricted data from more than 10 common text-based social media platforms including Facebook, Twitter, and Reddit between 2012 and 2016. We used natural language processing (NLP) to identify posts related to AIT and, separately, influenza vaccination (comparator procedure). NLP was followed by manual review to identify posts suggesting a possible SSTI associated with either AIT or influenza vaccination. SSTI frequencies with 95% CIs were compared. RESULTS: We identified 25,126 AIT posts, which were matched by social media platform to 25,126 influenza vaccination-related posts. NLP identified 4088 (16.3%) AIT posts that required manual review, with 6 posts (0.02%; 95% CI, 0.005%-0.043%) indicative of possible AIT-related SSTI. NLP identified 2689 (10.7%) influenza posts that required manual review, with 7 posts (0.03%; 95% CI, 0.007%-0.048%) indicative of possible influenza vaccination-related SSTI. CONCLUSIONS: Social media data suggest that SSTI from AIT and influenza vaccination are equally rare events. Given that AIT's SSTI risk appears comparable to the risk using a sterile pharmaceutical based on social media data, current aseptic technique procedures seem safe.

AB  - Drug-drug interactions (DDIs) are one of the indispensable factors leading to adverse event reactions. Considering the unique structure of AERS (Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FDA AERS)) reports, we changed the scope of the window value in the original skip-gram algorithm, then propose a language concept representation model and extract features of drug name and reaction information from large-scale AERS reports. The validation of our scheme was tested and verified by comparing with vectors originated from the cooccurrence matrix in tenfold cross-validation. In the verification of description enrichment of the DrugBank DDI database, accuracy was calculated for measurement. The average area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of logistic regression classifiers based on the proposed language model is 6% higher than that of the cooccurrence matrix. At the same time, the average accuracy in five severe adverse event classes is 88%. These results indicate that our language model can be useful for extracting drug and reaction features from large-scale AERS reports.

AB  - Liver malignant tumors (LMTs) represent a serious adverse drug event associated with drug-induced liver injury. Increases in endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) have attracted attention in recent years, due to their liver function-inhibiting abilities. Exposure to EDCs can induce nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, which are major etiologies of LMTs, through interaction with nuclear receptors (NR) and stress response pathways (SRs). Therefore, exposure to potential EDC drugs could be associated with drug-induced LMTs. However, the drug classes associated with LMTs and the molecular initiating events (MIEs) that are specific to these drugs are not well understood. In this study, using the Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System, we detected LMT-inducing drug signals based on adjusted odds ratios. Furthermore, based on the hypothesis that drug-induced LMTs are triggered by NR and SR modulation of potential EDCs, we used the quantitative structure-activity relationship platform for toxicity prediction to identify potential MIEs that are specific to LMT-inducing drug classes. Events related to cell proliferation and apoptosis, DNA damage, and lipid accumulation were identified as potential MIEs, and their relevance to LMTs was supported by the literature. The findings of this study may contribute to drug development and research, as well as regulatory decision making.

AB  - Background: On 12/23/2009 a new high-dose trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV3-HD) was licensed for adults aged ≥65 years. We assessed the post-licensure safety data for IIV3-HD in the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) during 2011–2019. Methods: We searched VAERS for reports after IIV3-HD during 1/1/2011–06/30/2019 in persons aged ≥65 years. Medical records were reviewed for all death reports and for certain pre-specified conditions (e.g. Guillain Barré Syndrome [GBS], anaphylaxis). We also reviewed certain groups who received IIV3-HD erroneously (e.g. pregnant women, children). Empirical Bayesian data mining was used to identify disproportional reporting. Results: VAERS received 12,320 reports after IIV3-HD;723 reports (5.9%) were serious. The most common adverse events (AEs) among serious reports were pyrexia (30.2%), asthenia (28.9%), and dyspnea (24.9%), and among non-serious reports were injection site erythema (16.8%), pain in extremity (15.8%), and injection site pain (14.2%). Among 55 death reports, the most common causes of death were diseases of the circulatory system (n = 23;41.8%). Based on medical record review, there were 61 reports of GBS and 13 of anaphylaxis. There were 13 reports of pregnant-women who inadvertently received IIV3-HD; three reports described arm pain or local reactions, and 10 did not report any AE. Among 59 reports of children who erroneously received IIV3-HD, 31 experienced an AE (most commonly injection site or constitutional reactions) and the remaining 28 reports did not describe any AE. Conclusions: Post-licensure safety data of IIV3-HD during 9 influenza seasons revealed no new or unexpected safety concerns among individuals ≥65 years. Inadvertent administration of IIV3-HD to children or pregnant women was observed, although with no serious AEs reported. Training and education of providers in vaccine recommendations and groups for whom the vaccine is indicated may help in preventing these vaccine administration errors. This review provides baseline information for future monitoring of the quadrivalent-high-dose influenza vaccine.

AB  - Background: Possible relationship between drug exposure and multiple sclerosis (MS) development is insufficiently investigated, and further challenged by the incomplete understanding of MS etiopathogenesis. The study aims to investigate whether drug exposure could contribute to MS, by analyzing worldwide spontaneous reporting archives of adverse drug reaction (ADRs). Research design and methods: We retrieved information from the US Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) over a 13-year period. Reporting odds ratio (ROR) for MS was calculated for each single substance. Disproportionality signals were considered when at least 10 cases were retrieved with a lower limit of the 95% confidence interval (CI) >1. Results: After a customized data-mining process, 3,226 reports of MS were retrieved. ‘Antineoplastic and immunomodulating drugs’ (33% of total reports) were the most frequently reported, with 10 disproportionality signals, including etanercept (445 cases; ROR: 2.48; 95% Cl: 2.24–2.74), adalimumab (329; 2.05; 1.83–2.30), and infliximab (119; 2.25; 1.87–2.70). We also observed signals for drugs acting on hormone balance, bone density, and central nervous system. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that immunomodulatory drugs increase the risk of MS and point out that some other drug classes should be further investigated for this risk.

AB  - Backgrounds: Although myocarditis has been reported in patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), there are few real-world studies to compare the occurrences and characteristics of myocarditis after different ICI regimens. Methods: Disproportionality analysis and Bayesian analysis were utilized for data mining of the suspected adverse events of myocarditis after ICIs use based on the Food and Drug Administration's Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) from January 2004 to June 2018. The times to onset and fatality rates of myocarditis following different ICI regimens were also compared. Results: A total of 315 reports of myocarditis adverse events were identified with ICIs. Among 6 ICI monotherapies, avelumab had the highest association with myocarditis based on the highest reporting odds ratio (ROR = 42.65, 95% two-sided CI = 15.86–114.72), proportional reporting ratio (PRR = 42.61, χ2 = 159.63) and empirical Bayes geometric mean (EBGM = 41.87, 95% one-sided CI = 15.57). The combination therapies of ipilimumab plus pembrolizumab or nivolumab had higher RORs, PRRs and EBGMs than did pembrolizumab or nivolumab monotherapy. Myocarditis associated with the ipilimumab plus nivolumab treatment appeared to have earlier onset (16.5 [IQR 14–29.75] days vs 32 [IQR 16–77] days, p<0.01) and higher fatality rate (65.75% vs 50.40%, p<0.05) than that associated with nivolumab monotherapy. Conclusions: Analysis of FAERS data provides more precise profile on the occurrences and characteristics of myocarditis after different ICI regimens. The findings support continued surveillance, risk factor identification, and comparative studies.

AB  - Background: Myopericarditis after vaccination has been sporadically reported in the medical literature. Here, we present a thorough descriptive analysis of reports to a national passive vaccine safety surveillance system (VAERS) of myopericarditis after vaccines licensed for use in the United States. Methods: We identified U.S. reports of myopericarditis received by VAERS during 1990–2018 that met a published case definition for myopericarditis or were physician-diagnosed. We stratified analysis by age group (<19, 19–49, ≥50 years), describing reports by serious/non-serious status, sex, time to symptom onset after vaccination, vaccine(s) administered, and exposure to other known causes of myopericarditis. We used Empirical Bayesian data mining to detect disproportionate reporting of myopericarditis after vaccination. Results: VAERS received 620,195 reports during 1990–2018: 708 (0.1%) met the case definition or were physician-diagnosed as myopericarditis. Most (79%) myopericarditis reports described males; 69% were serious; 72% had symptom onset ≤ 2 weeks postvaccination. Overall, smallpox (59%) and anthrax (23%) vaccines were most commonly reported. By age, among persons aged < 19 years, Haemophilus influenzae type b (22, 22%) and hepatitis B (18, 18%); among persons aged 19–49 years smallpox (387, 79%); among persons aged ≥ 50 years inactivated influenza (31, 36%) and live attenuated zoster (19, 22%) vaccines were most commonly reported. The vaccines most commonly reported remained unchanged when excluding 138 reports describing other known causes of myopericarditis. Data mining revealed disproportionate reporting of myopericarditis only after smallpox vaccine. Conclusions: Despite the introduction of new vaccines over the years, myopericarditis remains rarely reported after vaccines licensed for use in the United States. In this analysis, myopericarditis was most commonly reported after smallpox vaccine, and less commonly after other vaccines.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The Adverse Drug Event Reports (ADERs) from the spontaneous reporting system are important data sources for studying Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs) as well as post-marketing pharmacovigilance. Apart from the conventional ADR information contained in the structured section of ADERs, more detailed information such as pre- and post- ADR symptoms, multi-drug usages and ADR-relief treatments are described in the free-text section, which can be mined through Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to extract ADR-related entities from free-text section of Chinese ADERs, which can act as supplements for the information contained in structured section, so as to further assist in ADR evaluation. METHODS: Three models of Conditional Random Field (CRF), Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory-CRF (BiLSTM-CRF) and Lexical Feature based BiLSTM-CRF (LF-BiLSTM-CRF) were constructed to conduct Named Entity Recognition (NER) tasks in free-text section of Chinese ADERs. A semi-supervised learning method of tri-training was applied on the basis of the three established models to give un-annotated raw data with reliable tags. RESULTS: Among the three basic models, the LF-BiLSTM-CRF achieved the highest average F1 score of 94.35%. After the process of tri-training, almost half of the un-annotated cases were tagged with labels, and the performances of all the three models improved after iterative training. CONCLUSIONS: The LF-BiLSTM-CRF model that we constructed could achieve a comparatively high F1 score, and the fusion of CRF, while BiLSTM-CRF and LF-BiLSTM-CRF in tri-training might further strengthen the reliability of predicted tags. The results suggested the usefulness of our methods in developing the specialized NER tools for identifying ADR-related information from Chinese ADERs.

AB  - The identification of signals from spontaneous reporting systems plays an important role in monitoring the safety of medical products. Network analysis (NA) allows the representation of complex interactions among the key elements of such systems. We developed a network for a subset of the US Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) by representing the vaccines/adverse events (AEs) and their interconnections as the nodes and the edges, respectively; this subset we focused upon included possible anaphylaxis reports that were submitted for the H1N1 influenza vaccine. Subsequently, we calculated the main metrics that characterize the connectivity of the nodes and applied the island algorithm to identify the densest region in the network and, thus, identify potential safety signals. AEs associated with anaphylaxis formed a dense region in the 'anaphylaxis' network demonstrating the strength of NA techniques for pattern recognition. Additional validation and development of this approach is needed to improve future pharmacovigilance efforts.

AB  - The medical review of adverse event reports for medical products requires the processing of "big data" stored in spontaneous reporting systems, such as the US Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). VAERS data are not well suited to traditional statistical analyses so we developed the FDA Adverse Event Network Analyzer (AENA) and three novel network analysis approaches to extract information from these data. Our new approaches include a weighting scheme based on co-occurring triplets in reports, a visualization layout inspired by the islands algorithm, and a network growth methodology for the detection of outliers. We explored and verified these approaches by analysing the historical signal of Intussusception (IS) after the administration of RotaShield vaccine (RV) in 1999. We believe that our study supports the use of AENA for pattern recognition in medical product safety and other clinical data.

AB  - Background: Clinical trials are often underpowered to detect serious but rare adverse events of a new medication. We applied a novel data mining tool to detect potential adverse events of canagliflozin, the first sodium glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2 inhibitor) in the United States, using real-world data from shortly after its market entry and before public awareness of its potential safety concerns. Methods: In a U. S. commercial claims dataset (29 March 2013–30 Sept 2015), two pairwise cohorts of patients over 18 years of age with type 2 diabetes (T2D) who were newly dispensed canagliflozin or an active comparator, that is a dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitor (DPP4) or a glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist (GLP1), were identified and propensity score-matched. We used variable ratio matching with up to four people receiving a DPP4 or GLP1 for each person receiving canagliflozin. We identified potential safety signals using a hierarchical tree-based scan statistic data mining method with the hierarchical outcome tree constructed based on international classification of disease coding. We screened for incident adverse events where there were more outcomes observed among canagliflozin vs. comparator initiators than expected by chance, after adjusting for multiple testing. Results: We identified two pairwise propensity score variable ratio matched cohorts of 44,733 canagliflozin vs. 99,458 DPP4 initiators, and 55,974 canagliflozin vs. 74,727 GLP1 initiators. When we screened inpatient and emergency room diagnoses, diabetic ketoacidosis was the only severe adverse event associated with canagliflozin initiation with p <.05 in both cohorts. When outpatient diagnoses were also considered, signals for female and male genital infections emerged in both cohorts (p <.05). Conclusions and relevance: In a large population-based study, we identified known but no other adverse events associated with canagliflozin, providing reassurance on its safety among adult patients with T2D and suggesting the tree-based scan statistic method is a useful post-marketing safety monitoring tool for newly approved medications.

AB  - MOTIVATION: Knowledge of drug-drug interactions (DDIs) is crucial for health-care professionals to avoid adverse effects when co-administering drugs to patients. As most newly discovered DDIs are made available through scientific publications, automatic DDI extraction is highly relevant. RESULTS: We propose a novel feature-based approach to extract DDIs from text. Our approach consists of three steps. First, we apply text preprocessing to convert input sentences from a given dataset into structured representations. Second, we map each candidate DDI pair from that dataset into a suitable syntactic structure. Based on that, a novel set of features is used to generate feature vectors for these candidate DDI pairs. Third, the obtained feature vectors are used to train a support vector machine (SVM) classifier. When evaluated on two DDI extraction challenge test datasets from 2011 and 2013, our system achieves F-scores of 71.1% and 83.5%, respectively, outperforming any state-of-the-art DDI extraction system. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The source code is available for academic use at http://www.biosemantics.org/uploads/DDI.zip.

AB  - Background: An extensive amount of data derived from medical case reports regarding potential adverse events is subjected to manual review. Devising efficient strategies for identification and information extraction concerning potential adverse events are needed to support timely monitoring of the reports and decision making. Methods: This paper aims at providing a machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP) based solution for extracting suspect drugs and adverse events. The solution is based upon two approaches: Causal Sentence Classification classifies the relationship between drug and medical condition as causal or non-causal, and Suspect Drug Identification classifies each drug present in the report as a suspect drug or non-suspect drug. Results: Causal Sentence Classification yielded a precision of 0.85 and recall of 0.84 in establishing causality between drugs and medical conditions on the testing dataset consisting of 6252 records. After evaluation on a reliable testing dataset of 3522 records, the Suspect Drug Identification successfully identified suspect drugs with a precision of 0.72 and recall of 0.77. Conclusions: The developed solution relies on semantic and syntactic based features to capture the writing style of incoming reports, and showcases the potential of ML and NLP for Pharmacovigilance.

AB  - Objective The proportional reporting ratio (PRR) is a statistical method for signal detection of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) based on unbalanced proportions. Although effective, this method only takes into account the proportional relation based on target adverse reactions and ignores the relation between a given ADR and the others for the same drug. Therefore, it is necessary to improve the calculation deviation in PRR. In this study, we developed a novel PRR (NPRR) method and compared it with the original PRR method for the purpose of a combined application of these two methods for ADR signal detection. Methods NPRR is also based on unbalanced proportions, in which the proportion for a given ADR is linked to a specific drug (or all other drugs), and then divided by the corresponding proportion for all other ADRs. Results Applying this method to the ADR data of Jiangsu Province, China in 2008 and 2009, we detected 3,021 signals. Compared with the PRR method, the sensitivity of our method is 0.99, the specificity is 0.97, and the Youden index is 0.96. Conclusion NPRR is an excellent method supplementary to PRR. The combination of these two methods can reduce calculation deviation and detect ADRs more effectively.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Case reports showing that proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs), omeprazole and esomeprazole, can cause hypomagnesaemia have been accumulating since 2006. In this study, the reports submitted to the Adverse Event Reporting System (AERS) of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) were evaluated to assess omeprazole and esomeprazole in terms of susceptibility to hypomagnesaemia. METHODS: After a revision of arbitrary drug names and the deletion of duplicated submissions, the reports involving omeprazole and esomeprazole were analyzed. Standardized official pharmacovigilance tools were used for the quantitative detection of a signal, i.e., an association between a drug and an adverse drug event, including the proportional reporting ratio, the reporting odds ratio, the information component given by a Bayesian confidence propagation neural network, and the empirical Bayes geometric mean. RESULTS: A total of 22,017,956 co-occurrences were found in 1,644,220 reports from 2004 to 2009, where a co-occurrence was a pair of a drug and an adverse drug event. In total, 818 and 743 adverse drug events were listed as omeprazole- and esomeprazole-associated, with hypomagnesaemia ranking 85th and 135th, respectively. Although both PPIs were associated with hypomagnesaemia, the statistical metrics suggested that the association was more noteworthy for omeprazole. CONCLUSION: The data obtained in this study do not provide sufficient evidence to recommend systematic monitoring of magnesium levels in plasma, but chronic exposure to a PPI can lead to severe hypomagnesaemia.

AB  - Extensive clinical trials are required before a drug is placed on the market. It is, however, difficult to discover all the side effects, or adverse drug effects (ADE), for any approved drugs due to the limited number of required clinical trials before a drug is approved. The pervasive online social networks, such as Twitter, can provide additional information on ADE. Concurrently, advancements in social media technology have resulted in the booming of massive public data; the availability of these huge datasets offers numerous research opportunities for extracting ADEs. Towards this purpose, in this paper two effective computation pipelines are proposed, which use drug-related classification and sentiment analysis to extract ADEs on Twitter. The two pipelines are described in detail, and are implemented into automatic processes. Both pipelines are first separately evaluated, and then compared in parallel. Based on 25 days of Twitter data, the first pipeline has successfully predicted 79.4% of drug-related tweets with user opinions. The second pipeline, with its much simpler design, is able to identify much more ADE, as well as discover more new ADE. Based on 4 months of Twitter data collected, the second design is able to successfully capture 5 times more valid ADE than the first design, with 12 times more new ADEs discovered. We believe that these two proposed pipelines are promising methods for extracting ADEs in social networks, and may be applied to additional areas such as food, beverages, and other daily consumer products for identifying side effects and user opinions.

AB  - Named Entity Recognition (NER) in the healthcare domain involves identifying and categorizing disease, drugs, and symptoms for biosurveillance, extracting their related properties and activities, and identifying adverse drug events appearing in texts. These tasks are important challenges in healthcare. Analyzing user messages in social media networks such as Twitter can provide opportunities to detect and manage public health events. Twitter provides a broad range of short messages that contain interesting information for information extraction. In this paper, we present a Health-Related Named Entity Recognition (HNER) task using healthcare-domain ontology that can recognize health-related entities from large numbers of user messages from Twitter. For this task, we employ a deep learning architecture which is based on a recurrent neural network (RNN) with little feature engineering. To achieve our goal, we collected a large number of Twitter messages containing health-related information, and detected biomedical entities from the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS). A bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) model learned rich context information, and a convolutional neural network (CNN) was used to produce character-level features. The conditional random field (CRF) model predicted a sequence of labels that corresponded to a sequence of inputs, and the Viterbi algorithm was used to detect health-related entities from Twitter messages. We provide comprehensive results giving valuable insights for identifying medical entities in Twitter for various applications. The BiLSTM-CRF model achieved a precision of 93.99%, recall of 73.31%, and F1-score of 81.77% for disease or syndrome HNER; a precision of 90.83%, recall of 81.98%, and F1-score of 87.52% for sign or symptom HNER; and a precision of 94.85%, recall of 73.47%, and F1-score of 84.51% for pharmacologic substance named entities. The ontology-based manual annotation results show that it is possible to perform high-quality annotation despite the complexity of medical terminology and the lack of context in tweets.

AB  - Adverse Drug Reaction (ADR) is one of the major challenges to the evaluation of drug safety in the medical field. The Bayesian Confidence Propagation Neural Network (BCPNN) algorithm is the main algorithm used by the World Health Organization to monitor ADRs. Currently, ADR reports are collected through the spontaneous reporting system. However, with the continuous increase in ADR reports and possible use scenarios, the efficiency of the stand-alone ADR detection algorithm will encounter considerable challenges. Meanwhile, the BCPNN algorithm requires a certain number of disk I/O, which leads to considerable time consumption. In this study, we propose a Spark-based parallel BCPNN algorithm, which speeds up data processing and reduces the number of disk I/O in BCPNN, and two optimization strategies. Then, the ADR data collected from the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System are used to verify the performance of the proposed algorithm and its optimization strategies. Experiments show that the parallel BCPNN can significantly accelerate data processing and the optimized algorithm has a high acceleration rate and can effectively prevent memory overflow. Finally, we apply the proposed algorithm to a dataset provided by a real medical consortium. Experiments further prove the performance and practical value of the proposed algorithm.

AB  - Purpose: New pharmacovigilance methods are needed as a consequence of the morbidity caused by drugs. We exploit fine-grained drug related adverse event information extracted by text mining from electronic medical records (EMRs) to stratify patients based on their adverse events and to determine adverse event co-occurrences. Methods: We analyzed the similarity of adverse event profiles of 2347 patients extracted from EMRs from a mental health center in Denmark. The patients were clustered based on their adverse event profiles and the similarities were presented as a network. The set of adverse events in each main patient cluster was evaluated. Co-occurrences of adverse events in patients (p-value &#60; 0.01) were identified and presented as well. Results: We found that each cluster of patients typically had a most distinguishing adverse event. Examination of the co-occurrences of adverse events in patients led to the identification of potentially interesting adverse event correlations that may be further investigated as well as provide further patient stratification opportunities. Conclusions: We have demonstrated the feasibility of a novel approach in pharmacovigilance to stratify patients based on fine-grained adverse event profiles, which also makes it possible to identify adverse event correlations. Used on larger data sets, this data-driven method has the potential to reveal unknown patterns concerning adverse event occurrences.

AB  - PURPOSE: Adverse drug events (ADEs) are associated with high health and financial costs and have increased as more elderly patients treated with multiple medications emerge in an aging society. It has thus become challenging for physicians to identify drugs causing adverse events. This study proposes a novel approach that can improve clinical decision making with recommendations on ADE causative drugs based on patient information, drug information, and previous ADE cases. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We introduce a personalized and learning approach for detecting drugs with a specific adverse event, where recommendations tailored to each patient are generated using data mining techniques. Recommendations could be improved by learning the associations of patients and ADEs as more ADE cases are accumulated through iterations. After consulting the system-generated recommendations, a physician can alter prescriptions accordingly and report feedback, enabling the system to evolve with actual causal relationships. RESULTS: A prototype system is developed using ADE cases reported over 1.5 years and recommendations obtained from decision tree analysis are validated by physicians. Two representative cases demonstrate that the personalized recommendations could contribute to more prompt and accurate responses to ADEs. CONCLUSION: The current system where the information of individual drugs exists but is not organized in such a way that facilitates the extraction of relevant information together can be complemented with the proposed approach to enhance the treatment of patients with ADEs. Our illustrative results show the promise of the proposed system and further studies are expected to validate its performance with quantitative measures.

AB  - Background: Several pharmacological agents, such as chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine, have been promoted for COVID-19 treatment or pre-exposure prophylaxis. However, no comprehensive evaluation of the safety of these possible agents is available, and is urgently needed. Objective: The purpose of this study was to investigate the risks of cardiac adverse events associated with the possible pharmacotherapies for COVID-19, including certain antimalarial, antiviral, and antibiotic drugs. Patients and Methods: We conduced retrospective pharmacovigilance analyses of the US Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System database. The reporting odds ratio (ROR), a data mining algorithm commonly used in pharmacovigilance assessment, was generated to quantify the detection signal of adverse events. Results: Among individuals without coronavirus infection from 2015 Q1 to 2020 Q1, increased risks for cardiac disorders were found for antiviral agents such as chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine (ROR: 1.68; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.66–1.70), lopinavir/ritonavir (ROR: 1.52; 95% CI 1.39–1.66), and antibiotics such as azithromycin (ROR: 1.37; 95% CI 1.30–1.44) and ceftriaxone (ROR: 1.92; 95% CI 1.80–2.05). Increased serious cardiac adverse events, including myocardial infarction, arrhythmia, and cardiac arrest, were also reported for these drugs. Further analyses of individuals with coronavirus infections revealed that 40% of individuals receiving chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine reported serious cardiac adverse events. Two cases resulted in QT prolongations and one case resulted in cardiac arrest. Chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin contributed to all the QT prolongation and cardiac arrest cases. Conclusions: The current pharmacotherapies for COVID-19 are associated with increased risks of cardiac adverse events. Variations in the cardiac safety profiles of these pharmacotherapies were also observed. Clinicians should closely monitor patients with COVID-19, especially those at high risk, using chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin.

TI  - Pharmacovigilance from social media: An improved random subspace method for identifying adverse drug events
AU  - Liu, J.

PD  - 
AB  - Objective: Recent advances in Web 2.0 technologies have seen significant strides towards utilizing patient-generated content for pharmacovigilance. Social media-based pharmacovigilance has great potential to augment current efforts and provide regulatory authorities with valuable decision aids. Among various pharmacovigilance activities, identifying adverse drug events (ADEs) is very important for patient safety. However, in health-related discussion forums, ADEs may confound with drug indications and beneficial effects, etc. Therefore, the focus of this study is to develop a strategy to identify ADEs from other semantic types, and meanwhile to determine the drug that an ADE is associated with. Materials and methods: In this study, two groups of features, i.e., shallow linguistic features and semantic features, are explored. Moreover, motivated and inspired by the characteristics of explored two feature categories for social media-based ADE identification, an improved random subspace method, called Stratified Sampling-based Random Subspace (SSRS), is proposed. Unlike conventional random subspace method that applies random sampling for subspace selection, SSRS adopts stratified sampling-based subspace selection strategy. Results: A case study on heart disease discussion forums is performed to evaluate the effectiveness of the SSRS method. Experimental results reveal that the proposed SSRS method significantly outperforms other compared ensemble methods and existing approaches for ADE identification. Discussion and conclusion: Our proposed method is easy to implement since it is based on two feature sets that can be naturally derived, and therefore, can omit artificial stratum generation efforts. Moreover, SSRS has great potential of being applied to deal with other high-dimensional problems that can represent original data from two different aspects.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Social media is becoming increasingly popular as a platform for sharing personal health-related information. This information can be utilized for public health monitoring tasks, particularly for pharmacovigilance, via the use of natural language processing (NLP) techniques. However, the language in social media is highly informal, and user-expressed medical concepts are often nontechnical, descriptive, and challenging to extract. There has been limited progress in addressing these challenges, and thus far, advanced machine learning-based NLP techniques have been underutilized. Our objective is to design a machine learning-based approach to extract mentions of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) from highly informal text in social media. METHODS: We introduce ADRMine, a machine learning-based concept extraction system that uses conditional random fields (CRFs). ADRMine utilizes a variety of features, including a novel feature for modeling words' semantic similarities. The similarities are modeled by clustering words based on unsupervised, pretrained word representation vectors (embeddings) generated from unlabeled user posts in social media using a deep learning technique. RESULTS: ADRMine outperforms several strong baseline systems in the ADR extraction task by achieving an F-measure of 0.82. Feature analysis demonstrates that the proposed word cluster features significantly improve extraction performance. CONCLUSION: It is possible to extract complex medical concepts, with relatively high performance, from informal, user-generated content. Our approach is particularly scalable, suitable for social media mining, as it relies on large volumes of unlabeled data, thus diminishing the need for large, annotated training data sets.

AB  - Objectives: The current demographic information from China reports that 10%-19% of patients hospitalized with coronavirus disease (COVID-19) were diabetic. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) are considered first-line agents in patients with diabetes because of their nephroprotective effects, but administration of these drugs leads to upregulation of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is responsible for the viral entry of severe acute respiratory distress syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Data are lacking to determine what pulmonary effects ACEIs or ARBs may have in patients with diabetes, which could be relevant in the management of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. This study aims to assess the prevalence of pulmonary adverse drug effects (ADEs) in patients with diabetes who were taking ACEI or ARBs to provide guidance as to how these medications could affect outcomes in acute respiratory illnesses such as SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods: 1DATA, a unique data platform resulting from collaboration across veterinary and human health care, used an intelligent medicine recommender system (1DrugAssist) developed using several national and international databases to evaluate all ADEs reported to the Food and Drug Administration for patients with diabetes taking ACEIs or ARBs. Results: Mining of this data elucidated the proportion of a cluster of pulmonary ADEs associated with specific medications in these classes, which may aid health care professionals in understanding how these medications could worsen or predispose patients with diabetes to infections affecting the respiratory system, specifically COVID-19. Based on this data mining process, captopril was found to have a statistically significantly higher incidence of pulmonary ADEs compared with other ACEIs (P = 0.005) as well as ARBs (P = 0.012), though other specific drugs also had important pulmonary ADEs associated with their use. Conclusion: These analyses suggest that pharmacists and clinicians will need to consider the specific medication's adverse event profile, particularly captopril, on how it may affect infections and other acute disease states that alter pulmonary function, such as COVID-19.

AB  - With increasing adoption of electronic health records (EHRs), there is an opportunity to use the free-text portion of EHRs for pharmacovigilance. We present novel methods that annotate the unstructured clinical notes and transform them into a deidentified patient-feature matrix encoded using medical terminologies. We demonstrate the use of the resulting high-throughput data for detecting drug-adverse event associations and adverse events associated with drug-drug interactions. We show that these methods flag adverse events early (in most cases before an official alert), allow filtering of spurious signals by adjusting for potential confounding, and compile prevalence information.We argue that analyzing large volumes of free-text clinical notes enables drug safety surveillance using a yet untapped data source. Such data mining can be used for hypothesis generation and for rapid analysis of suspected adverse event risk.

AB  - Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are the undesirable effects associated with the use of a drug due to some pharmacological action of the drug. During the last few years, social media has become a popular platform where people discuss their health problems and, therefore, has become a popular source to share information related to ADR in the natural language. This paper presents an end-to-end system for modelling ADR detection from the given text by fine-tuning BERT with a highly modular Framework for Adapting Representation Models (FARM). BERT overcame the predominant neural networks bringing remarkable performance gains. However, training BERT is a computationally expensive task which limits its usage for production environments and makes it difficult to determine the most important hyperparameters for the downstream task. Furthermore, developing an end-to-end ADR extraction system comprising two downstream tasks, i.e., text classification for filtering text containing ADRs and extracting ADR mentions from the classified text, is also challenging. The framework used in this work, FARM-BERT, provides support for multitask learning by combining multiple prediction heads which makes training of the end-to-end systems easier and computationally faster. In the proposed model, one prediction head is used for text classification and the other is used for ADR sequence labeling. Experiments are performed on Twitter, PubMed, TwiMed-Twitter, and TwiMed-PubMed datasets. The proposed model is compared with the baseline models and state-of-the-art techniques, and it is shown that it yields better results for the given task with the F-scores of 89.6%, 97.6%, 84.9%, and 95.9% on Twitter, PubMed, TwiMed-Twitter, and TwiMed-PubMed datasets, respectively. Moreover, training time and testing time of the proposed model are compared with BERT's, and it is shown that the proposed model is computationally faster than BERT.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Pharmacovigilance aims to uncover and understand harmful side-effects of drugs, termed adverse events (AEs). Although the current process of pharmacovigilance is very systematic, the increasing amount of information available in specialized health-related websites as well as the exponential growth in medical literature presents a unique opportunity to supplement traditional adverse event gathering mechanisms with new-age ones. METHOD: We present a semi-automated pipeline to extract associations between drugs and side effects from traditional structured adverse event databases, enhanced by potential drug-adverse event pairs mined from user-comments from health-related websites and MEDLINE abstracts. The pipeline was tested using a set of 12 drugs representative of two previous studies of adverse event extraction from health-related websites and MEDLINE abstracts. RESULTS: Testing the pipeline shows that mining non-traditional sources helps substantiate the adverse event databases. The non-traditional sources not only contain the known AEs, but also suggest some unreported AEs for drugs which can then be analyzed further. CONCLUSION: A semi-automated pipeline to extract the AE pairs from adverse event databases as well as potential AE pairs from non-traditional sources such as text from MEDLINE abstracts and user-comments from health-related websites is presented.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Adverse event reports (AERs) submitted to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) were reviewed to confirm the platinum agent-associated mild, severe, and lethal hypersensitivity reactions. METHODS: Authorized pharmacovigilance tools were used for quantitative signal detection, including the proportional reporting ratio, the reporting odds ratio, the information component given by a Bayesian confidence propagation neural network, and the empirical Bayes geometric mean. Excess2, given by the multi-item gamma Poisson Shrinker algorithm, was used to evaluate the effects of dexamethasone and diphenhydramine on oxaliplatin-induced hypersensitivity reactions. RESULTS: Based on 1,644,220 AERs from 2004 to 2009, carboplatin and oxaliplatin proved to cause mild, severe, and lethal hypersensitivity reactions, whereas cisplatin did not. Dexamethasone affected oxaliplatin-induced mild hypersensitivity reactions, but had lesser effects on severe and lethal reactions. The effects of diphenhydramine were not confirmed. CONCLUSION: The FDA's adverse event reporting system, AERS, with optimized data mining tools is useful to authorize potential associations between platinum agents and hypersensitivity reactions.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Automatic detection of adverse drug reaction (ADR) mentions from text has recently received significant interest in pharmacovigilance research. Current research focuses on various sources of text-based information, including social media-where enormous amounts of user posted data is available, which have the potential for use in pharmacovigilance if collected and filtered accurately. The aims of this study are: (i) to explore natural language processing (NLP) approaches for generating useful features from text, and utilizing them in optimized machine learning algorithms for automatic classification of ADR assertive text segments; (ii) to present two data sets that we prepared for the task of ADR detection from user posted internet data; and (iii) to investigate if combining training data from distinct corpora can improve automatic classification accuracies. METHODS: One of our three data sets contains annotated sentences from clinical reports, and the two other data sets, built in-house, consist of annotated posts from social media. Our text classification approach relies on generating a large set of features, representing semantic properties (e.g., sentiment, polarity, and topic), from short text nuggets. Importantly, using our expanded feature sets, we combine training data from different corpora in attempts to boost classification accuracies. RESULTS: Our feature-rich classification approach performs significantly better than previously published approaches with ADR class F-scores of 0.812 (previously reported best: 0.770), 0.538 and 0.678 for the three data sets. Combining training data from multiple compatible corpora further improves the ADR F-scores for the in-house data sets to 0.597 (improvement of 5.9 units) and 0.704 (improvement of 2.6 units) respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Our research results indicate that using advanced NLP techniques for generating information rich features from text can significantly improve classification accuracies over existing benchmarks. Our experiments illustrate the benefits of incorporating various semantic features such as topics, concepts, sentiments, and polarities. Finally, we show that integration of information from compatible corpora can significantly improve classification performance. This form of multi-corpus training may be particularly useful in cases where data sets are heavily imbalanced (e.g., social media data), and may reduce the time and costs associated with the annotation of data in the future.

AB  - Background: 23-Valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine, trade name Pneumovax®23 (PPSV23), has been used for decades in the Unites States and has an extensive clinical record. However, limited post-licensure safety assessment has been conducted. Objective: To analyze reports submitted to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) following PPSV23 from 1990 to 2013 in order to characterize its safety profile. Methods: We searched the VAERS database for US reports following PPSV23 for persons vaccinated from 1990 to 2013. We assessed safety through: automated analysis of VAERS data, crude adverse event (AE) reporting rates based on PPSV23 doses distributed in the US market, clinical review of death reports and reports involving vaccine administered to pregnant women, and empirical Bayesian data mining to assess for disproportional reporting. Results: During the study period, VAERS received 25,168 PPSV23 reports; 92% were non-serious, 67% were in females and 86% were in adults aged ≥19 years. When PPSV23 was administered alone, fever (43%), injection site erythema (28%) and injection site pain (25%) were the most commonly reported non-serious AEs in children. Injection site erythema (32%), injection site pain (27%) and injection site swelling (23%) were the most commonly reported non-serious AEs in adults. Of serious reports (2129, 8% of total), fever was most commonly reported in both children (69%) and adults (39%). There were 66 reports of death, four in children and 62 in adults. Clinical review of death reports did not reveal any concerning patterns that would suggest a causal association with PPSV23. No disproportional reporting of unexpected AEs was observed in empirical Bayesian data mining. Conclusions: We did not identify any new or unexpected safety concerns for PPSV23. The VAERS data are consistent with safety data from pre-licensure clinical trials and other post-licensure studies.

AB  - Background: Herpes zoster (HZ), or shingles, is caused by reactivation of varicella-zoster virus in latently infected individuals. Live-attenuated HZ vaccine (zoster vaccine live, ZVL) is approved in the United States for persons aged ≥50 years and recommended by the CDC for persons ≥60 years. Methods: We analyzed U.S. reports of adverse events (AEs) following ZVL submitted to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), a spontaneous reporting system to monitor vaccine safety, for persons vaccinated May 1, 2006, through January 31, 2015. We conducted descriptive analysis, clinical reviews of reports with selected pre-specified conditions, and empirical Bayesian data mining. Results: VAERS received 23,092 reports following ZVL, of which 22,120 (96%) were classified as non-serious. Of reports where age was documented (n = 18,817), 83% were in persons aged ≥60 years. Reporting rates of AEs were 106 and 4.4 per 100,000 ZVL doses distributed for all reports and serious reports, respectively. When ZVL was administered alone among persons aged ≥50 years, injection site erythema (27%), HZ (17%), injection site swelling (17%), and rash (14%) were the most commonly reported symptoms among non-serious reports; HZ (29%), pain (18%), and rash (16%) were the most commonly reported symptoms among serious reports. Six reports included laboratory evidence of vaccine-strain varicella-zoster virus (Oka/Merck strain) infection; AEs included HZ, HZor varicella-like illness, and local reaction with vesicles. In our review of reports of death with sufficient information to determine cause (n = 46, median age 75 years), the most common causes were heart disease (n = 28), sepsis (n = 4), and stroke (n = 3). Empirical Bayesian data mining did not detect new or unexpected safety signals. Conclusions: Findings from our safety review of ZVL are consistent with those from pre-licensure clinical trials and other post-licensure assessments. Transient injection-site reactions, HZ, and rashes were most frequently reported to VAERS following ZVL. Overall, our results are reassuring regarding the safety of ZVL.

AB  - Background The 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) was first recommended for use in adults aged ⩾19 years with immunocompromising conditions in June 2012. On August 2014, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommended routine use of PCV13 among adults aged ⩾65 years. Methods We assessed adverse events (AEs) reports following PCV13 in adults aged ⩾19 years reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) from June 2012 to December 2015. VAERS is a national spontaneous reporting system for monitoring AEs following vaccination. Our assessment included automated data analysis, clinical review of all serious reports and reports of special interest. We conducted empirical Bayesian data mining to assess for disproportionate reporting. Results VAERS received 2976 US PCV13 adult reports; 2103 (71%) of these reports were from PCV13 administered alone. Fourteen percent were in persons aged 19–64 years and 86% were in persons aged ⩾65 years. Injection site erythema (28%), injection site pain (24%) and fever (22%) were the most frequent AEs among persons aged 19–64 years; injection site erythema (30%), erythema (20%) and injection site swelling (18%) were the most frequent among persons aged ⩾65 years who were given the vaccine alone. The most frequently reported AEs among non-death serious reports were injection site reactions and general malaise among persons 19–64 years old; injection site reactions, general malaise and Guillain-Barré syndrome among those ⩾65 years (Table 2). Data mining did not detect disproportional reporting for any unexpected AE. Conclusions The results of this study were consistent with safety data from pre-licensure studies of PCV13. We did not detect any new or unexpected AEs.

AB  - Background: Quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccines (IIV4) were first available for use during 2013-14 influenza season for individuals aged ≥6 months. IIV4 is designed to protect against four different flu viruses; two influenza A viruses and two influenza B viruses. Methods: We searched the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) for US reports after IIV4 and trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV3) from 7/1/2013-5/31/2015. Medical records were requested for non-manufacturer reports classified as serious (i.e. death, hospitalization, prolonged hospitalization, life-threatening illness, permanent disability). The review included automated data analysis, clinical review of all serious reports, reports of special interest, and empirical Bayesian data mining. Results: VAERS received 1,838 IIV4 reports; 512 (28%) in persons aged 6 months-17 years of which 42 (8.2%) were serious reports; 1,265 (69%) in persons aged >18 years of which 84 (6.6%) were serious reports; two in children <6 months and 59 in persons of unknown age. Injection site erythema (24%), fever (14%) and injection site swelling (17%) were the most frequent adverse events among persons aged 6 months-17 years, while injection site pain (16%), pain (15%) and pain in extremity (13%) were the most frequent among persons aged 18-64 years given the vaccine alone. Among non-death serious reports, injection site reactions, constitutional symptoms, Guillain-Barré syndrome, seizures, and anaphylaxis were the most frequently reported adverse events. Data mining detected disproportional reporting for incorrect vaccine administration with no associated adverse events. Adverse events following IIV4 reported to VAERS were similar to those following IIV3. Conclusions: In our review of VAERS reports, IIV4 had a similar safety profile to IIV3. Most of the reported AEs were non-serious. Our findings are consistent with data from pre-licensure studies of IIV4.

AB  - Background: Quadrivalent live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV4) was approved in 2012 for healthy persons aged 2-49 years. Beginning with the 2013-2014 influenza season, LAIV4 replaced trivalent live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV3). Methods: We analyzed LAIV4 reports to VAERS, a national spontaneous reporting system. LAIV4 reports in 2013-2014 were compared to LAIV3 reports from the previous three influenza seasons. Medical records were reviewed for non-manufacturer serious reports (i.e., death, hospitalization, prolonged hospitalization, life-threatening illness, permanent disability) and reports of selected conditions of interest. We conducted Empirical Bayesian data mining to identify disproportional reporting for LAIV4. Results: In 2013-2014, 12.7 million doses of LAIV4 were distributed and VAERS received 779 reports in individuals aged 2-49 years; 95% were non-serious. Expired drug administered (42%), fever (13%) and cough (8%) were most commonly reported in children aged 2-17 years when LAIV4 was administered alone, while headache (18%), expired drug administered (15%) and exposure during pregnancy (12%) were most common in adults aged 18-49 years. We identified one death report in a child who died from complications of cerebellar vascular tumors. Among non-death serious reports, neurologic conditions were common in children and adults. In children, seizures (3) and Guillain-Barré syndrome (2) were the most common serious neurologic outcomes. We identified three serious reports of asthma/wheezing following LAIV4 in children. Data mining detected disproportional reporting for vaccine administration errors and for influenza illness in children. Conclusions: Our analysis of VAERS reports for LAIV4 did not identify any concerning patterns. The data mining finding for reports of influenza illness is consistent with low LAIV4 vaccine effectiveness observed for influenza A disease in children in 2013-2014. Reports of LAIV4 administration to persons in whom the vaccine is not recommended (e.g., pregnant women) indicate the need for education, training and screening regarding indications.

AB  - Background: Trivalent adjuvanted influenza vaccine (aIIV3; Fluad®) was approved in the United States (U.S.) in 2015 for adults aged ≥65 years and has been in use since the 2016–17 influenza season. Methods: We analyzed U.S. reports for aIIV3 submitted from July 1, 2016 through June 30, 2018 to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), a national spontaneous reporting system. Medical records were reviewed for serious reports. Among individuals ≥65 years of age, the relative frequency of the most commonly reported adverse events (AEs) after aIIV3 were compared with non-adjuvanted inactivated influenza vaccines given to adults aged ≥65 years, high-dose trivalent influenza vaccine (IIV3-HD) and trivalent or quadrivalent vaccines (IIV3/IIV4). Data mining analyses were undertaken to identify whether AEs for aIIV3 occurred disproportionately more than expected compared to all influenza vaccines. Results: VAERS received 630 reports after aIIV3, of which 521 (83%) were in adults aged ≥65 years; 79 (13%) in persons <65 years and in 30 (5%) reports age was missing; 19 (3%) reports were serious, including two deaths (0.4%) related to myocardial infarction and Sjogren's syndrome. The most common AEs reported in adults aged ≥65 years were injection site pain (21%) and erythema (18%), with similar proportions reported for IIV3-HD (17% and 19%, respectively) and for IIV3/IIV4 (15%, each). Except for reports related to vaccination of inappropriate age (n = 79) and syringe malfunction (n = 6), data mining did not identify other disproportionately reported AEs. Conclusions: Although our review of aIIV3 in VAERS did not identify any unexpected health conditions of concern, we observed more than twice the expected number of reports with administration of the vaccine to persons outside of the age range for which the vaccine is approved in the U.S. Health care providers should be educated on the age groups for whom aIIV3 is recommended.

AB  - Background: Trivalent live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV3) was licensed and recommended for use in 2003 in children and adults 2-49 years of age. Post-licensure safety data have been limited, particularly in adults. Methods: We searched Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) for US reports after LAIV3 from July 1, 2005-June 30, 2013 (eight influenza seasons) in adults aged ≥ 18 years old. We conducted descriptive analyses and clinically reviewed serious reports (i.e., death, life-threatening illness, hospitalization, prolonged hospitalization, or permanent disability) and reports of selected conditions of interest. We used empirical Bayesian data mining to identify adverse events (AEs) that were reported more frequently than expected. We calculated crude AE reporting rates to VAERS by influenza season. Results: During the study period, VAERS received 1207 LAIV3 reports in adults aged 18-49 years old; 107 (8.9%) were serious, including four death reports. The most commonly reported events were expired drug administered (n=207, 17%), headache (n=192, 16%), and fever (n=133, 11%). The most common diagnostic categories for non-fatal serious reports were neurological (n=40, 39%), cardiovascular (n=14, 14%), and other non-infectious conditions (n=20, 19%). We noted a higher proportion of Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) and cardiovascular reports in the Department of Defense (DoD) population compared to the civilian population. Data mining detected disproportional reporting of ataxia (n=15); clinical review revealed that ataxia was a component of diverse clinical entities including GBS. Conclusions: Review of VAERS reports are reassuring, the only unexpected safety concern for LAIV3 identified was a higher than expected number of GBS reports in the DoD population, which is being investigated. Reports of administration of expired LAIV3 represent administration errors and indicate the need for education, training and screening regarding the approved indications.

AB  - Background. The first trivalent live-attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV3) was licensed in 2003 for use in healthy persons 5-49 years of age. In 2007, the US Food and Drug Administration expanded its indication to healthy children 2-4 years of age. Methods. We searched the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) for US reports after LAIV3 from July 1, 2005 to June 30, 2012 in children aged 2-18 years. Medical records were requested for nonmanufacturer reports coded as serious (ie, death, hospitalization, prolonged hospitalization, life-threatening illness, disability). We characterized electronic data and clinically reviewed all serious reports and reports of special interest. Empirical Bayesian data mining was used to identify new or unexpected adverse events (AEs). Results. During the study period, VAERS received 2619 US LAIV3 reports for children aged 2-18 years 197 (7.5%) reports were serious, including 5 deaths. The 2 most frequent nonfatal serious reports involved neurological and respiratory systems, with 56 (29.2%) and 43 (22.4%) reports, respectively. The most frequent neurological diagnoses were seizures and Guillain-Barré Syndrome, and the most frequent respiratory conditions were pneumonia and asthma or reactive airway disease. Data mining showed increased proportions for reports of medication errors, most commonly vaccine administration errors not associated with an AE. Conclusions. In this VAERS analysis of reports following LAIV3, we found no new or unexpected AEs patterns. Reports of LAIV3 administration to persons, for whom it is not recommended, including children with a history of asthma or reactive airway disease or wheezing, indicate that ongoing monitoring and education in vaccine indications are needed.

AB  - Background: In 1980, human diploid cell vaccine (HDCV, Imovax Rabies, Sanofi Pasteur), was licensed for use in the United States. Objective: To assess adverse events (AEs) after HDCV reported to the US Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), a spontaneous reporting surveillance system. Methods: We searched VAERS for US reports after HDCV among persons vaccinated from January 1, 1990–July 31, 2015. Medical records were requested for reports classified as serious (death, hospitalization, prolonged hospitalization, disability, life-threatening-illness), and those suggesting anaphylaxis and Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS). Physicians reviewed available information and assigned a primary clinical category to each report using MedDRA system organ classes. Empirical Bayesian (EB) data mining was used to identify disproportional AE reporting after HDCV. Results: VAERS received 1,611 reports after HDCV; 93 (5.8%) were serious. Among all reports, the three most common AEs included pyrexia (18.2%), headache (17.9%), and nausea (16.5%). Among serious reports, four deaths appeared to be unrelated to vaccination. Conclusions: This 25-year review of VAERS did not identify new or unexpected AEs after HDCV. The vast majority of AEs were non-serious. Injection site reactions, hypersensitivity reactions, and non-specific constitutional symptoms were most frequently reported, similar to findings in pre-licensure studies.

AB  - Background.In December 2009, a new high-dose, trivalent, inactivated influenza vaccine (TIV-HD) was licensed for adults aged ≥65 years. We characterized clinical patterns of reports to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) among older adults who received TIV-HD.Methods.We searched VAERS for reports involving persons aged ≥65 years who received TIV-HD or TIV (standard dose) from 1 July 2010 through 31 December 2010. Medical records were requested for serious reports (ie, those associated with death, hospitalization or prolonged hospitalization, life-threatening illness, or disability). Clinicians reviewed information and assigned a diagnostic category to each report. Empirical Bayesian data mining was used to identify disproportional reporting following TIV-HD in VAERS. Reporting rates were calculated for reports of Guillain-Barré syndrome and anaphylaxis.Results.VAERS received 606 reports after TIV-HD in persons aged ≥65 years (8.2% of reports involved serious events). The number of reports yielded by searches using the terms "ocular hyperemia" and "vomiting" exceeded the data mining threshold; >80% of these reports were nonserious. Clinical review of serious reports found that a greater proportion involving gastrointestinal events were made after TIV-HD receipt (5 of 51 [9.8%]) than after TIV receipt (1 of 123 [0.8%]). Four persons who received TIV-HD had gastroenteritis, and 1 had multiple gastrointestinal symptoms; all recovered. A higher proportion of cardiac events were noted after receipt of TIV-HD (9 of 51 [17.6%]) than after receipt of TIV (6 of 123 [4.9%]). No concerning clinical pattern was apparent. The reporting rates of Guillain-Barré syndrome and anaphylaxis after TIV-HD receipt were 1.4 and 1.0 reports per million doses distributed, respectively.Conclusions.During the first year after US licensure of TIV-HD, no new serious safety concerns were identified in VAERS. Our analyses suggested a clinically important imbalance between the reported and expected number of gastrointestinal events after TIV-HD receipt. Future studies should assess this potential association. © 2012 The Author.

AB  - Context: In June 2006, the Food and Drug Administration licensed the quadrivalent human papillomavirus (types 6, 11, 16, and 18) recombinant vaccine (qHPV) in the United States for use in females aged 9 to 26 years; the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices then recommended qHPV for routine vaccination of girls aged 11 to 12 years. Objective: To summarize reports to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) following receipt of qHPV. Design, Setting, and Participants: Review and describe adverse events following immunization (AEFIs) reported to VAERS, a national, voluntary, passive surveillance system, from June 1, 2006, through December 31, 2008. Additional analyses were performed for some AEFIs in prelicensure trials, those of unusual severity, or those that had received public attention. Statistical data mining, including proportional reporting ratios (PRRs) and empirical Bayesian geometric mean methods, were used to detect disproportionality in reporting. Main Outcome Measures: Numbers of reported AEFIs, reporting rates (reports per 100 000 doses of distributed vaccine or per person-years at risk), and comparisons with expected background rates. Results: VAERS received 12 424 reports of AEFIs following qHPV distribution, a rate of 53.9 reports per 100 000 doses distributed. A total of 772 reports (6.2% of all reports) described serious AEFIs, including 32 reports of death. The reporting rates per 100 000 qHPV doses distributed were 8.2 for syncope; 7.5 for local site reactions; 6.8 for dizziness; 5.0 for nausea; 4.1 for headache; 3.1 for hypersensitivity reactions; 2.6 for urticaria; 0.2 for venous thromboembolic events, autoimmune disorders, and Guillain-Barré syndrome; 0.1 for anaphylaxis and death; 0.04 for transverse myelitis and pancreatitis; and 0.009 for motor neuron disease. Disproportional reporting of syncope and venous thromboembolic events was noted with data mining methods. Conclusions: Most of the AEFI rates were not greater than the background rates compared with other vaccines, but there was disproportional reporting of syncope and venous thromboembolic events. The significance of these findings must be tempered with the limitations (possible underreporting) of a passive reporting system. ©2009 American Medical Association. All rights reserved.

AB  - The objective of this study was to apply 2 data-mining algorithms to a drug safety database to determine if these methods would have flagged potentially fatal/disabling adverse drug reactions that triggered black box warnings/drug withdrawals in advance of initial identification via "traditional" methods. Relevant drug-event combinations were identified from a journal publication. Data-mining algorithms using commonly cited disproportionality thresholds were then applied to the US Food and Drug Administration database. Seventy drug-event combinations were considered sufficiently specific for retrospective data mining. In a minority of instances, potential signals of disproportionate reporting were provided clearly in advance of initial identification via traditional pharmacovigilance methods. Data-mining algorithms have the potential to improve pharmacovigilance screening; however, for the majority of drug-event combinations, there was no substantial benefit of either over traditional methods. They should be considered as potential supplements to, and not substitutes for, traditional pharmacovigilance strategies. More research and experience will be needed to optimize deployment of data-mining algorithms in pharmacovigilance. ©2005 the American College of Clinical Pharmacology.

AB  - Background:Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is a growing problem with few available therapies. Cilostazol is the only FDA-approved medication with a class I indication for intermittent claudication, but carries a black box warning due to concerns for increased cardiovascular mortality. To assess the validity of this black box warning, we employed a novel text-analytics pipeline to quantify the adverse events associated with Cilostazol use in a clinical setting, including patients with congestive heart failure (CHF).Methods and Results:We analyzed the electronic medical records of 1.8 million subjects from the Stanford clinical data warehouse spanning 18 years using a novel text-mining/statistical analytics pipeline. We identified 232 PAD patients taking Cilostazol and created a control group of 1,160 PAD patients not taking this drug using 1:5 propensity-score matching. Over a mean follow up of 4.2 years, we observed no association between Cilostazol use and any major adverse cardiovascular event including stroke (OR = 1.13, CI [0.82, 1.55]), myocardial infarction (OR = 1.00, CI [0.71, 1.39]), or death (OR = 0.86, CI [0.63, 1.18]). Cilostazol was not associated with an increase in any arrhythmic complication. We also identified a subset of CHF patients who were prescribed Cilostazol despite its black box warning, and found that it did not increase mortality in this high-risk group of patients.Conclusions:This proof of principle study shows the potential of text-analytics to mine clinical data warehouses to uncover 'natural experiments' such as the use of Cilostazol in CHF patients. We envision this method will have broad applications for examining difficult to test clinical hypotheses and to aid in post-marketing drug safety surveillance. Moreover, our observations argue for a prospective study to examine the validity of a drug safety warning that may be unnecessarily limiting the use of an efficacious therapy. © 2013 Leeper et al.

AB  - Adverse drug events (ADEs) remain a large problem in the United States, being the fourth leading cause of death, despite post market drug surveillance. Much post consumer drug surveillance relies on self-reported "spontaneous" patient data. Previous work has performed datamining over the FDA's Adverse Event Reporting System (AERS) and other spontaneous reporting systems to identify drug interactions and drugs correlated with high rates of serious adverse events. However, safety problems have resulted from the lack of post marketing surveillance information about drugs, with underreporting rates of up to 98% within such systems. We explore the use of online health forums as a source of data to identify drugs for further FDA scrutiny. In this work we aggregate individuals' opinions and review of drugs similar to crowd intelligence3. We use natural language processing to group drugs discussed in similar ways and are able to successfully identify drugs withdrawn from the market based on messages discussing them before their removal.

AB  - The aim of this study was to apply machine learning methods to deeply explore the risk factors associated with adverse drug events (ADEs) and predict the occurrence of ADEs in Chinese pediatric inpatients. Data of 1,746 patients aged between 28 days and 18 years (mean age = 3.84 years) were included in the study from January 1, 2013, to December 31, 2015, in the Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University. There were 247 cases of ADE occurrence, of which the most common drugs inducing ADEs were antibacterials. Seven algorithms, including eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), CatBoost, AdaBoost, LightGBM, Random Forest (RF), Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT), and TPOT, were used to select the important risk factors, and GBDT was chosen to establish the prediction model with the best predicting abilities (precision = 44%, recall = 25%, F1 = 31.88%). The GBDT model has better performance than Global Trigger Tools (GTTs) for ADE prediction (precision 44 vs. 13.3%). In addition, multiple risk factors were identified via GBDT, such as the number of trigger true (TT) (+), number of doses, BMI, number of drugs, number of admission, height, length of hospital stay, weight, age, and number of diagnoses. The influencing directions of the risk factors on ADEs were displayed through Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP). This study provides a novel method to accurately predict adverse drug events in Chinese pediatric inpatients with the associated risk factors, which may be applicable in clinical practice in the future.

AB  - Using electronic health data to predict adverse drug reaction (ADR) incurs practical challenges, such as lack of adequate data from any single site for rare ADR detection, resource constraints on integrating data from multiple sources, and privacy concerns with creating a centralized database from person-specific, sensitive data. We introduce a federated learning framework that can learn a global ADR prediction model from distributed health data held locally at different sites. We propose two novel methods of local model aggregation to improve the predictive capability of the global model. Through comprehensive experimental evaluation using real-world health data from 1 million patients, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach in achieving comparable performance to centralized learning and outperforming localized learning models for two types of ADRs. We also demonstrate that, for varying data distributions, our aggregation methods outperform state-of-the-art techniques, in terms of precision, recall, and accuracy.

TI  - Predicting Drug Recalls from Internet Search Engine Queries
AU  - Yom-Tov, E.

PD  - 
AB  - Batches of pharmaceuticals are sometimes recalled from the market when a safety issue or a defect is detected in specific production runs of a drug. Such problems are usually detected when patients or healthcare providers report abnormalities to medical authorities. Here, we test the hypothesis that defective production lots can be detected earlier by monitoring queries to Internet search engines. We extracted queries from the USA to the Bing search engine, which mentioned one of the 5195 pharmaceutical drugs during 2015 and all recall notifications issued by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) during that year. By using attributes that quantify the change in query volume at the state level, we attempted to predict if a recall of a specific drug will be ordered by FDA in a time horizon ranging from 1 to 40 days in future. Our results show that future drug recalls can indeed be identified with an AUC of 0.791 and a lift at 5% of approximately 6 when predicting a recall occurring one day ahead. This performance degrades as prediction is made for longer periods ahead. The most indicative attributes for prediction are sudden spikes in query volume about a specific medicine in each state. Recalls of prescription drugs and those estimated to be of medium-risk are more likely to be identified using search query data. These findings suggest that aggregated Internet search engine data can be used to facilitate in early warning of faulty batches of medicines.

AB  - Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are the major source of morbidity and mortality. The prediction of drug risk level based on ADRs is few. Our study aims at predicting the drug risk level from ADRs using machine learning approaches. A total of 985,960 ADR reports from 2011 to 2018 were attained from the Chinese spontaneous reporting database (CSRD) in Jiangsu Province. Among them, there were 887 Prescription (Rx) Drugs (84.72%), 113 Over-the-Counter-A (OTC-A) Drugs (10.79%) and 47 OTC-B Drugs (4.49%). An over-sampling method, Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE), was applied to the imbalanced classification. Firstly, we proposed a multi-classification framework based on SMOTE and classifiers. Secondly, drugs in CSRD were taken as the samples, ADR signal values calculated by proportional reporting ratio (PRR) or information component (IC) were taken as the features. Then, we applied four classifiers: Random Forest (RF), Gradient Boost (GB), Logistic Regression (LR), AdaBoost (ADA) to the tagged data. After evaluating the classification results by specific metrics, we finally obtained the optimal combination of our framework, PRR-SMOTE-RF with an accuracy rate of 0.95. We anticipate that this study can be a strong auxiliary judgment basis for experts on the status change of Rx Drugs to OTC Drugs.

AB  - Drug safety is of great importance to public health. The detrimental effects of drugs not only limit their application but also cause suffering in individual patients and evoke distrust of pharmacotherapy. For the purpose of identifying drugs that could be suspected of causing adverse reactions, we present a structure-activity relationship analysis of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) in the central nervous system (CNS), liver, and kidney, and also of allergic reactions, for a broad variety of drugs (n = 507) from the Swiss drug registry. Using decision tree induction, a machine learning method, we determined the chemical, physical, and structural properties of compounds that predispose them to causing ADRs. The models had high predictive accuracies (78.9-90.2%) for allergic, renal, CNS, and hepatic ADRs. We show the feasibility of predicting complex end-organ effects using simple models that involve no expensive computations and that can be used (i) in the selection of the compound during the drug discovery stage, (ii) to understand how drugs interact with the target organ systems, and (iii) for generating alerts in postmarketing drug surveillance and pharmacovigilance.

AB  - Continuous monitoring the safe use of medication is an important task in pharmacovigilance. The first-hand experiences of medication effects come from the consumers of the pharmaceuticals. Social media have been considered as a possible alternative data source for gathering consumer-generated information of their experience with medications. Identifying personal experience in social media data is a challenging task in natural language processing. In this study, we investigated a method of predicating personal experience tweets using Google's Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) and neural networks, in which BERT models contextually represented the tweet text. Both pre-trained BERT models and our BERT model trained with 3.2 million unlabeled tweets were examined. Our results show that our trained BERT model performs better than Google's pre-trained models (p <; 0.01). This suggests that domain-specific data may contribute to the BERT model yielding better classification performance in predicting personal experience tweets of medication use.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The digitization of healthcare data, resulting from the increasingly widespread adoption of electronic health records, has greatly facilitated its analysis by computational methods and thereby enabled large-scale secondary use thereof. This can be exploited to support public health activities such as pharmacovigilance, wherein the safety of drugs is monitored to inform regulatory decisions about sustained use. To that end, electronic health records have emerged as a potentially valuable data source, providing access to longitudinal observations of patient treatment and drug use. A nascent line of research concerns predictive modeling of healthcare data for the automatic detection of adverse drug events, which presents its own set of challenges: it is not yet clear how to represent the heterogeneous data types in a manner conducive to learning high-performing machine learning models. METHODS: Datasets from an electronic health record database are used for learning predictive models with the purpose of detecting adverse drug events. The use and representation of two data types, as well as their combination, are studied: clinical codes, describing prescribed drugs and assigned diagnoses, and measurements. Feature selection is conducted on the various types of data to reduce dimensionality and sparsity, while allowing for an in-depth feature analysis of the usefulness of each data type and representation. RESULTS: Within each data type, combining multiple representations yields better predictive performance compared to using any single representation. The use of clinical codes for adverse drug event detection significantly outperforms the use of measurements; however, there is no significant difference over datasets between using only clinical codes and their combination with measurements. For certain adverse drug events, the combination does, however, outperform using only clinical codes. Feature selection leads to increased predictive performance for both data types, in isolation and combined. CONCLUSIONS: We have demonstrated how machine learning can be applied to electronic health records for the purpose of detecting adverse drug events and proposed solutions to some of the challenges this presents, including how to represent the various data types. Overall, clinical codes are more useful than measurements and, in specific cases, it is beneficial to combine the two.

AB  - Misspellings in clinical free text present potential challenges to pharmacovigilance tasks, such as monitoring for potential ineffective treatment of drug-resistant infections. We developed a novel method using Word2Vec, Levenshtein edit distance constraints, and a customized lexicon to identify correct and misspelled pharmaceutical word forms. We processed a large corpus of clinical notes in a real-world pharmacovigilance task, achieving positive predictive values of 0.929 and 0.909 in identifying valid misspellings and correct spellings, respectively, and negative predictive values of 0.994 and 0.333 as assessments where the program did not produce output. In a specific Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus use case, the method identified 9,815 additional instances in the corpus for potential inaffective drug administration inspection. The findings suggest that this method could potentially achieve satisfactory results for other pharmacovigilance tasks.

AB  - With increasing trend of polypharmacy, drug-drug interaction (DDI)-induced adverse drug events (ADEs) are considered as a major challenge for clinical practice. As premarketing clinical trials usually have stringent inclusion/exclusion criteria, limited comedication data capture and often times small sample size have limited values in study DDIs. On the other hand, ADE reports collected by spontaneous reporting system (SRS) become an important source for DDI studies. There are two major challenges in detecting DDI signals from SRS: confounding bias and false positive rate. In this article, we propose a novel approach, propensity score-adjusted three-component mixture model (PS-3CMM). This model can simultaneously adjust for confounding bias and estimate false discovery rate for all drug-drug-ADE combinations in FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS), which is a preeminent SRS database. In simulation studies, PS-3CMM performs better in detecting true DDIs comparing to the existing approach. It is more sensitive in selecting the DDI signals that have nonpositive individual drug relative ADE risk (NPIRR). The application of PS-3CMM is illustrated in analyzing the FAERS database. Compared to the existing approaches, PS-3CMM prioritizes DDI signals differently. PS-3CMM gives high priorities to DDI signals that have NPIRR. Both simulation studies and FAERS data analysis conclude that our new PS-3CMM is a new method that is complement to the existing DDI signal detection methods.

AB  - Classical methods used for signal detection in pharmacovigilance rely on disproportionality analysis of counts aggregating spontaneous reports of a given adverse drug reaction. In recent years, alternative methods have been proposed to analyze individual spontaneous reports such as penalized multiple logistic regression approaches. These approaches address some well-known biases resulting from disproportionality methods. However, while penalization accounts for computational constraints due to high-dimensional data, it raises the issue of determining the regularization parameter and eventually that of an error-controlling decision rule. We present a new automated signal detection strategy for pharmacovigilance systems, based on propensity scores (PS) in high dimension. PSs are increasingly used to assess a given association with high-dimensional observational healthcare databases in accounting for confusion bias. Our main aim was to develop a method having the same advantages as multiple regression approaches in dealing with bias, while relying on the statistical multiple comparison framework as regards decision thresholds, by considering false discovery rate (FDR)-based decision rules. We investigate four PS estimation methods in high dimension: a gradient tree boosting (GTB) algorithm from machine-learning and three variable selection algorithms. For each (drug, adverse event) pair, the PS is then applied as adjustment covariate or by using two kinds of weighting: inverse proportional treatment weighting and matching weights. The different versions of the new approach were compared to a univariate approach, which is a disproportionality method, and to two penalized multiple logistic regression approaches, directly applied on spontaneous reporting data. Performance was assessed through an empirical comparative study conducted on a reference signal set in the French national pharmacovigilance database (2000-2016) that was recently proposed for drug-induced liver injury. Multiple regression approaches performed better in detecting true positives and false positives. Nonetheless, the performances of the PS-based methods using matching weights was very similar to that of multiple regression and better than with the univariate approach. In addition to being able to control FDR statistical errors, the proposed PS-based strategy is an interesting alternative to multiple regression approaches.

AB  - Introduction: A large number of studies on systems to detect and sometimes normalize adverse events (AEs) in social media have been published, but evidence of their practical utility is scarce. This raises the question of the transferability of such systems to new settings. Objectives: The aims of this study were to develop an AE recognition system, prospectively evaluate its performance on an external benchmark dataset and identify potential factors influencing the transferability of AE recognition systems. Methods: A pipeline based on dictionary lookups and logistic regression classifiers was developed using a proprietary dataset of 196,533 Tweets manually annotated for AE relations and prospectively evaluated the system on the publicly available WEB-RADR reference dataset, exploring different aspects affecting transferability. Results: Our system achieved 0.53 precision, 0.52 recall and 0.52 F1-score on the development test set; however, when applied to the WEB-RADR reference dataset, system performance dropped to 0.38 precision, 0.20 recall and 0.26 F1-score. Similarly, a previously published method aiming at automatically detecting adverse event posts reported 0.5 precision, 0.92 recall and 0.65 F1-score on thus another dataset, while performance on the WEB-RADR reference dataset was reduced to 0.37 precision, 0.63 recall and 0.46 F1-score. We identified four potential factors leading to poor transferability: overfitting, selection bias, label bias and prevalence. Conclusion: We warn the community about a potentially large discrepancy between the expected performance of automated AE recognition systems based on published results and the actual observed performance on independent data. This study highlights the difficulty of implementing an all-purpose system for automatic adverse event recognition in Twitter, which could explain the lack of such systems in practical pharmacovigilance settings. Our recommendation is to use benchmark independent datasets, such as the WEB-RADR reference, to investigate the transferability of the adverse event recognition systems and ultimately enforce rigorous comparisons across studies on the task.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: In 2008, the US FDA issued an alert about an increased risk of psychiatric events associated with montelukast. Recent national pharmacovigilance analyses in Sweden, France and Spain detected a potential increase in reporting risk of the association. AIM: Our objective was to analyse spontaneous reports of psychiatric events in children and adolescents worldwide treated with montelukast. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of Individual Case Safety Reports (ICSRs) recorded up to 1 January 2015 in the World Health Organization (WHO) database (VigiBase(®)), in which montelukast was associated with 'psychiatric disorders'. We used the Bayesian Confidence Propagation Neural Network (BCPNN) approach for signal generation. RESULTS: A total of 14,670 ICSRs for montelukast were recorded, of which 2630 corresponded to psychiatric disorders in people aged <18 years. The main symptoms reported for infants (aged <2 years) were sleep disorders, for children (aged 2-11 years) the main symptoms were depression/anxiety, and for adolescents (aged 12-17 years) they were suicidal behaviour and depression/anxiety. Suicidal behaviour was over-represented in all age groups with information component (IC) values that reached 5.01 in children and 3.85 in adolescents. Unexpectedly, completed suicides were reported more frequently for children (IC: 3.15; IC025: 1.98) than for adolescents (IC: 3.11; IC025: 2.61) or the total population (IC 1.95; IC025: 1.73). CONCLUSIONS: Neuropsychiatric disorders as side effects of montelukast were more frequently reported for children than for adults. Infants and children seem to be more prone to sleep disturbances, whereas adolescents present symptoms of depression/anxiety and psychotic reactions more often. Suicidal behaviour and completed suicide appear to be more frequently reported than previously thought in practice. Risk management plans and epidemiological studies are needed to quantify the risk. Practitioners should be aware of the risk of neuropsychiatric events associated with montelukast use, and should advise the patient and report new cases.

AB  - Background: The detrimental effects of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are well established. Hence, precise and accurate assessment of ADRs' causality which can differentiate signal from noise is crucial in screening, management and minimisation of ADRs. Objective: The current study reported our attempt to improve the scoring system of a previously published algorithm of ADR assessment by our group using a genetic algorithm approach so that the final score can measure the probability of ADR causality. Design: Using ADR cases obtained from the Centre for Drug Administration, the national centre for pharmacovigilance in Singapore, with known causality probability values as reference points, rules were developed to define possible combinations of criteria for 'Definite' ADR cases and 'Probable' ADR cases. A new scoring system was developed using these parameters with the help of genetic algorithm, and tested on 37 'Definite' and 431 'Not Definite' ADR cases. In addition, sensitivity and specificity analysis were performed to allow a comparison of performance between our algorithm and that used by the Adverse Drug Reaction Advisory Committee in Australia (ADRAC). Results: The new scoring system is able to provide a probability of the causality of an ADR by a suspected drug. When applied to the 'Definite' and 'Not Definite' ADR reports, the new algorithm gave a sensitivity of 83.8% and specificity of 71.0%. Conclusions: Using a quantitative method of assessing causality in the new algorithm allows rare and new ADRs to be more readily identified since a quantitative score can give a more precise degree of ADR causality. This scoring system that provides a probability score would help to make this algorithm more informative and assistive for clinicians, regulatory agencies or pharmaceutical companies to generate ADR alerts. The higher sensitivity value displayed by our algorithm also shows that it would be a good ADR screening tool. © 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: In Singapore, the Health Sciences Authority (HSA) reviews an average of 20,000 spontaneous adverse event (AE) reports yearly. Potential safety signals are identified manually and discussed on a weekly basis. In this study, we compared the use of four quantitative data mining (QDM) methods with weekly manual review to determine if signals of disproportionate reporting (SDRs) can improve the efficiency of manual reviews and thereby enhance drug safety signal detection. Methods: We formulated a QDM triage strategy to reduce the number of SDRs for weekly review and compared the results against those derived from manual reviews alone for the same 6-month period. We then incorporated QDM triage into the manual review workflow for the subsequent two 6-month periods and made further comparisons against QDM triage alone. Results: The incorporation of QDM triage into routine manual reviews resulted in a reduction of 20% to 30% in the number of drug–AE pairs identified for further evaluation. Sequential Probability Ratio Test (SPRT) detected more signals that mirror human manual signal detection than the other three methods. Conclusions: The adoption of QDM triage into our manual reviews is a more efficient way forward in signal detection, avoiding missing important drug safety signals.

AB  - In this study detection of association between drugs and Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs), is carried out by using Naive Bayes method. Adverse event reports submitted to the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) were reviewed to find top 10 drugs causing frequent ADRs for a particular period. The main objective of this paper is to evaluate drugs associated with list of outcomes provided by FDA. For a particular category of disease, drugs creating outcomes are ranked using Naive Bayes method. FDA represents ADRs in Preferred Terms(PT) by referring Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). To create conceptual hierarchy System Organ Class (SOC) present in MedDRA is mapped with low level Preferred Terms (PT) in FDA dataset. For each SOC the drugs are ranked based on posterior probability obtained by Naive Bayes method. Data mining model has been built to analyse drugs associated with outcome for a disease category in SOC level. The newly designed tool is user friendly and applicable to pharmaceutical industries, policy makers and practitioners. © 2013 Asian Network for Scientific Information.

AB  - Background: Baricitinib is approved for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The authors retrospectively investigated adverse events (AEs) by data-mining a self-reporting database to better understand toxicities, especially since it has been used during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Methods: A reporting odds ratio (ROR) was used to detect the risk signals from the data in the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) adverse event reporting system database (FAERS). The definition relied on system organ class (SOCs) and preferred terms (PTs) by the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). Results: The search retrieved 1,598 baricitinib-associated cases within the reporting period: 86 PTs with significant disproportionality were retained. Infections including “herpes zoster”, “oral herpes” and “herpes virus infection” were found at a similar rate to those reported in trials, and such events were rare. Reports emerged for several thrombotic adverse events, while these events were also rare. Unexpected safety signals as opportunistic infections were detected. Serious outcomes as death and life-threatening outcomes accounted for 9.76% of the reported cases. Conclusions: The incidence of these AEs does not appear above the background expected. These data are consistent with routine clinical observations and suggest the importance of pharmacovigilance.

AB  - Purpose - Many opinion-mining systems and tools have been developed to provide users with the attitudes of people toward entities and their attributes or the overall polarities of documents. In addition, side effects are one of the critical measures used to evaluate a patient's opinion for a particular drug. However, side effect recognition is a challenging task, since side effects coincide with disease symptoms lexically and syntactically. The purpose of this paper is to extract drug side effects from drug reviews as an integral implicit-opinion words. Design/methodology/approach - This paper proposes a detection algorithm to a medical-opinionmining system using rule-based and support vector machines (SVM) algorithms. A corpus from 225 drug reviews was manually annotated by a medical expert for training and testing. Findings - The results show that SVM significantly outperforms a rule-based algorithm. However, the results of both algorithms are encouraging and a good foundation for future research. Obviating the limitations and exploiting combined approaches would improve the results. Practical implications - An automatic extraction for adverse drug effects information from online text can help regulatory authorities in rapid information screening and extraction instead of manual inspection and contributes to the acceleration of medical decision support and safety alert generation. Originality/value - The results of this study can help database curators in compiling adverse drug effects databases and researchers to digest the huge amount of textual online information which is growing rapidly.

AB  - Social media in medicine, where patients can express their personal treatment experiences by personal computers and mobile devices, usually contains plenty of useful medical information, such as adverse drug reactions (ADRs); mining this useful medical information from social media has attracted more and more attention from researchers. In this study, we propose a deep neural network (called LSTM-CRF) combining long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks (a type of recurrent neural networks) and conditional randomfields (CRFs) to recognize ADR mentions from social media in medicine and investigate the effects of three factors on ADR mention recognition. The three factors are as follows: (1) representation for continuous and discontinuous ADR mentions: two novel representations, that is, "BIOHD" and "Multilabel," are compared; (2) subject of posts: each post has a subject (i.e., drug here); and (3) external knowledge bases. Experiments conducted on a benchmark corpus, that is, CADEC, show that LSTM-CRF achieves better F-score than CRF; "Multilabel" is better in representing continuous and discontinuous ADR mentions than "BIOHD"; both subjects of comments and external knowledge bases are individually beneficial to ADR mention recognition. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time to investigate deep neural networks to mine continuous and discontinuous ADRs from social media.

AB  - PURPOSE: A population-based study and anecdotal reports have indicated that the publication of the Randomized Aldactone Evaluation Study (RALES) was associated with not merely a broader use of spironolactone in the treatment of heart failure, but also with a coinciding sharp increase in hyperkalemia-associated morbidity/mortality in patients also being treated with ACE-inhibitors. Data mining algorithms (DMAs) are being applied to spontaneous reporting system (SRS) databases in hopes of obtaining early warnings/additional insights into post-licensure safety data. We applied two DMAs (i.e. multi-item gamma Poisson shrinker [MGPS] and proportional reporting ratios [PRRs]) to spontaneous reporting system (SRS) data to determine if these DMAs could have provided an earlier indication of a possible hyperkalemia safety issue. METHODS: MGPS and PRRs were retrospectively applied to US FDA-AERS, an SRS database. Year-by-year analysis and analysis of increasing cumulative time intervals were performed on cases in which both spironolactone and hyperkalemia and possibly related cardiac events had been reported. RESULTS: Neither of the DMAs initially provided a compelling signal of disproportionate reporting (SDR) for hyperkalemia after publication of RALES. However, using events consistent with clinical sequelae of hyperkalemia (e.g,. sudden death), SDRs were identified with PRRs. CONCLUSIONS: The quality and usefulness of data mining analysis is highly situation dependent and may vary with the knowledge and experience of the drug safety reviewer. Our analysis suggests that contemporary DMAs may have significant limitations in detecting increased frequency of labeled events in real-life prospective pharmacovigilance. There is a paucity of research in this area and we recommend further research for new approaches to detecting increased frequency of labeled events.

AB  - Social media offer insights of patients' medical problems such as drug side effects and treatment failures. Patient reports of adverse drug events from social media have great potential to improve current practice of pharmacovigilance. However, extracting patient adverse drug event reports from social media continues to be an important challenge for health informatics research. In this study, we develop a research framework with advanced natural language processing techniques for integrated and high-performance patient reported adverse drug event extraction. The framework consists of medical entity extraction for recognizing patient discussions of drug and events, adverse drug event extraction with shortest dependency path kernel based statistical learning method and semantic filtering with information from medical knowledge bases, and report source classification to tease out noise. To evaluate the proposed framework, a series of experiments were conducted on a test bed encompassing about postings from major diabetes and heart disease forums in the United States. The results reveal that each component of the framework significantly contributes to its overall effectiveness. Our framework significantly outperforms prior work.

AB  - Purpose: Inappropriate medication criteria for the elderly have played an important role in ensuring the safety of medications for the elderly. Too few drugs included in the criteria cannot guarantee the safety of medication for the elderly. Too many drugs included in the criteria will result in less selective medication for the elderly. This paper uses real-world data to evaluate the relationship between antihypertensive drugs and falls, so as to provide references for experts and scholars to revise the criteria of potentially inappropriate medications for the elderly and clinical safe medication. Method: We use the US Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FDA FAERS) to evaluate the association between specific antihypertensive drugs in six categories (alpha-1 receptor blockers (α-1 blockers), calcium channel blockers (CCBs), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), beta-receptor blockers (β-blockers), and diuretics) and falls by data mining algorithms, including the reporting odds ratio (ROR), the proportional reporting ratio (PRR), Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), and the empirical Bayes geometric mean (EBGM) and compared with the relevant drugs included in the Beers Criteria and STOPP/START Criteria. Result: There are a total of 5,157,172 co-occurrences found in 973,447 reports aged 65 years or older from 2016 to 2019 in the FDA FAERS database, and the number of co-occurrences of falls is 5917 for the six categories of 51 antihypertensive drugs. Four kinds of mining methods overlap detection of 12 kinds of positive signal drugs, none of which are not included in the Beers Criteria and 7 drugs are included in the STOPP/START Criteria; 1–3 kinds of mining methods overlap detection of positive signal drugs, a total of 12 kinds, and one drug is included in the Beers Criteria and 5 drugs are included in the STOPP/START Criteria; 22 drugs have fall adverse events, but no positive signal is detected, and 13 drugs are included in STOPP/START Criteria; and 5 drugs have no fall adverse events and 3 drugs are included in the STOPP/START Criteria. Conclusion: The FAERS database was used to confirm the potential connection between some antihypertensive drugs and fall adverse events through data mining algorithms. The Beers Criteria did not clearly indicate the antihypertensive drugs that caused falls, and the antihypertensive drugs included in the STOPP/START Criteria were too extensive and did not include β-blockers and diuretics. It is recommended that experts and scholars use real-world data (such as FAERS, EudraVigilance, WHO VigiBase, and so on) to further explore the relationship between specific antihypertensive drugs and falls in the elderly, so as to revise and improve the criteria for inappropriate medications for the elderly.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The detection of new drug safety signals is of growing importance with ever more new drugs becoming available and exposure to medicines increasing. The task of evaluating information relating to safety lies with national agencies and, for international data, with the World Health Organization Programme for International Drug Monitoring. RATIONALE: An established approach for identifying new drug safety signals from the international database of more than 2 million case reports depends upon clinical experts from around the world. With a very large amount of information to evaluate, such an approach is open to human error. To aid the clinical review, we have developed a new signalling process using Bayesian logic, applied to data mining, within a confidence propagation neural network (Bayesian Confidence Propagation Neural Network; BCPNN). Ultimately, this will also allow the evaluation of complex variables. METHODS: The first part of this study tested the predictive value of the BCPNN in new signal detection as compared with reference literature sources (Martindale's Extra Pharmacopoeia in 1993 and July 2000, and the Physicians Desk Reference in July 2000). In the second part of the study, results with the BCPNN method were compared with those of the former signalling procedure. RESULTS: In the study period (the first quarter of 1993) 107 drug-adverse reaction combinations were highlighted as new positive associations by the BCPNN, and referred to new drugs. 15 drug-adverse reaction combinations on new drugs became negative BCPNN associations in the study period. The BCPNN method detected signals with a positive predictive value of 44% and the negative predictive value was 85%. 17 as yet unconfirmed positive associations could not be dismissed with certainty as false positive signals. Of the 10 drug-adverse reaction signals produced by the former signal detection system from data sent out for review during the study period, 6 were also identified by the BCPNN. These 6 associations have all had a more than 10-fold increase of reports and 4 of them have been included in the reference sources. The remaining 4 signals that were not identified by the BCPNN had a small, or no, increase in the number of reports, and are not listed in the reference sources. CONCLUSION: Our evaluation showed that the BCPNN approach had a high and promising predictive value in identifying early signals of new adverse drug reactions.

AB  - BACKGROUND: With the exception of case reports, limited data are available regarding the risk of hepatotoxicity associated with the use of telithromycin. OBJECTIVE: To detect the safety signal regarding the reporting of hepatotoxicity associated with the use of telithromycin using 4 commonly employed data mining algorithms (DMAs). METHODS: Based on the Adverse Events Reporting System (AERS) database of the Food and Drug Administration, 4 DMAs, including the reporting odds ratio (ROR), the proportional reporting ratio (PRR), the information component (IC), and the Gamma Poisson Shrinker (GPS), were applied to examine the association between the reporting of hepatotoxicity and the use of telithromycin. The study period was from the first quarter of 2004 to the second quarter of 2006. The reporting of hepatotoxicity was identified using the preferred terms indexed in the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities. The drug name was used to identify reports regarding the use of telithromycin. RESULTS: A total of 226 reports describing hepatotoxicity associated with the use of telithromycin were recorded in the AERS. A safety problem of telithromycin associated with increased reporting of hepatotoxicity was clearly detected by 4 algorithms as early as 2005, signaling the problem in the first quarter by the ROR and the IC, in the second quarter by the PRR, and in the fourth quarter by the GPS. CONCLUSIONS: A safety signal was indicated by the 4 DMAs suggesting an association between the reporting of hepatotoxicity and the use of telithromycin. Given the wide use of telithromycin and serious consequences of hepatotoxicity, clinicians should be cautious when selecting telithromycin for treatment of an infection. In addition, further observational studies are required to evaluate the utility of signal detection systems for early recognition of serious, life-threatening, low-frequency drug-induced adverse events.

AB  - Spontaneous reporting systems of adverse drug events have been widely established in many countries to collect as could as possible all adverse drug events to facilitate the detection of suspected ADR signals via some statistical or data mining methods. Unfortunately, due to privacy concern or other reasons, the reporters sometimes may omit consciously some attributes, causing many missing values existing in the reporting database. Most of research work on ADR detection or methods applied in practice simply adopted listwise deletion to eliminate all data with missing values. Very little work has noticed the possibility and examined the effect of including the missing data in the process of ADR detection. This paper represents our endeavor towards the exploration of this question. We aim at inspecting the feasibility of applying rough set theory to the ADR detection problem. Based on the concept of utilizing characteristic set based approximation to measure the strength of ADR signals, we propose twelve different rough set based measuring methods and show only six of them are feasible for the purpose. Experimental results conducted on the FARES database show that our rough-set-based approach exhibits similar capability in timeline warning of suspicious ADR signals as traditional method with missing deletion, and sometimes can yield noteworthy measures earlier than the traditional method.

AB  - MOTIVATION: Drugs and diseases play a central role in many areas of biomedical research and healthcare. Aggregating knowledge about these entities across a broader range of domains and languages is critical for information extraction (IE) applications. To facilitate text mining methods for analysis and comparison of patient's health conditions and adverse drug reactions reported on the Internet with traditional sources such as drug labels, we present a new corpus of Russian language health reviews. RESULTS: The Russian Drug Reaction Corpus (RuDReC) is a new partially annotated corpus of consumer reviews in Russian about pharmaceutical products for the detection of health-related named entities and the effectiveness of pharmaceutical products. The corpus itself consists of two parts, the raw one and the labeled one. The raw part includes 1.4 million health-related user-generated texts collected from various Internet sources, including social media. The labeled part contains 500 consumer reviews about drug therapy with drug- and disease-related information. Labels for sentences include health-related issues or their absence. The sentences with one are additionally labeled at the expression level for identification of fine-grained subtypes such as drug classes and drug forms, drug indications and drug reactions. Further, we present a baseline model for named entity recognition (NER) and multilabel sentence classification tasks on this corpus. The macro F1 score of 74.85% in the NER task was achieved by our RuDR-BERT model. For the sentence classification task, our model achieves the macro F1 score of 68.82% gaining 7.47% over the score of BERT model trained on Russian data. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: We make the RuDReC corpus and pretrained weights of domain-specific BERT models freely available at https://github.com/cimm-kzn/RuDReC. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.

AB  - Aims: Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines prevent infection with oncogenic virus types. We analysed reports to the US Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) of adverse events (AE) following bivalent HPV vaccine (2vHPV). Methods: We conducted descriptive analysis of 2vHPV reports, reviewed individual reports, calculated crude AE reporting rates and conducted empirical Bayesian data mining. Results: Of 241 2vHPV reports, 158 were in females, 64 in males (2vHPV is approved for females only) and 19 with unknown sex; 95.8% were classified as nonserious. Dizziness, headache, nausea and injection site reactions were the most common symptoms. Crude AE reporting rates were 33.3 reports per 100 000 doses distributed overall, and 1.4 per 100 000 for serious reports. Empirical Bayesian data mining identified disproportional reporting for three types of medical errors; assessment indicated findings that were probably driven by inadvertent 2vHPV use in males. Conclusions: We did not identify any new or unexpected safety concerns in our review of 2vHPV reports to VAERS.

AB  - Introduction: Currently four recombinant hepatitis B (HepB) vaccines are in use in the United States. HepB vaccines are recommended for infants, children and adults. We assessed adverse events (AEs) following HepB vaccines reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), a national spontaneous reporting system. Methods: We searched VAERS for reports of AEs following single antigen HepB vaccine and HepB-containing vaccines (either given alone or with other vaccines), from January 2005 - December 2015. We conducted descriptive analyses and performed empirical Bayesian data mining to assess disproportionate reporting. We reviewed serious reports including reports of special interest. Results: VAERS received 20,231 reports following HepB or HepB-containing vaccines: 10,291 (51%) in persons <2 years of age; 2588 (13%) in persons 2–18 years and 5867 (29%) in persons >18 years; for 1485 (7.3%) age was missing. Dizziness and nausea (8.4% each) were the most frequently reported AEs following a single antigen HepB vaccine: fever (23%) and injection site erythema (11%) were most frequent following Hep-containing vaccines. Of the 4444 (22%) reports after single antigen HepB vaccine, 303 (6.8%) were serious, including 45 deaths. Most commonly reported cause of death was Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (197). Most common non-death serious reports following single antigen HepB vaccines among infants aged <1 month, were nervous system disorders (15) among children aged 1–23 months; infections and infestation (8) among persons age 2–18 years blood and lymphatic systemic disorders; and general disorders and administration site conditions among persons age >18 years. Most common vaccination error following single antigen HepB was incorrect product storage. Conclusions: Review current U.S.-licensed HepB vaccines administered alone or in combination with other vaccines did not reveal new or unexpected safety concerns. Vaccination errors were identified which indicate the need for training and education of providers on HepB vaccine indications and recommendations.

AB  - Objective: The objective of the study was to identify possible toxic signal induced by cisplatin and carboplatin treatment by searching database from Canadian Adverse Reaction Monitoring Program (CADRMP). Methods: A total of 10429 reports of patients between January 1970 to March 2010 were downloaded from Canada Adverse reaction Monitoring Program website. These reports contained information of adverse events associated with all other drugs inclusive of platinum compounds. Adverse drug reaction (ADR) signal detection were determined by proportional reporting ratio (PRR), reporting odds ratio (ROR), PRR calculated by chi-square statistics, 95% confidence interval of PRR, observed to expected (O/E) ratio and De Mouchel method calculated PRR. Information component (IC) was given by Bayesian confidence propagation neural network. (As per regulatory criteria, PRR ≥ 2, ROR ≥ 1, chi-square statistics calculated PRR ≥ 4 and lower bound of 95% CI of PRR ≥ 1 to consider particular adverse drug reaction as a signal. Further by BCPNN method, if IC − 2SD ≤ 0 then that drug-ADR pair considered as no signal; if 0<IC − 2SD ≤1.5, then that drug-ADR pair considered as weak signal; if 1.5<IC−2SD ≤ 3.0, then that drug-ADR pair considered as middle signal; if IC − 2SD>3.0, then that drug-ADR pair considered as strong signal). Results: A total of 28 reports of cisplatin-induced ototoxicity and 122 reports of carboplatin-induced pruritis were obtained from CADRMP database. For cisplatin, the PRR was found to be 53.44 and by the Du Mouchel Method it was 20.7977. Further, the PRR calculated by chi-square statistics was 544.70 whereas the lower and upper limits of 95% CI of PRR was found to be 3.67 and 4.57, respectively. The O/E ratio was found to be 20.9130 and ROR was found to be 55.03 for cisplatin-induced ototoxicity. For carboplatin, the PRR was found to be 7.04412 and by the Du Mouchel Method it was 16.4360. Further, the PRR calculated by chi-square statistics was 623.36645 whereas the lower and upper limits of 95% CI of PRR was found to be 2.9167 and 3.6475, respectively. The O/E ratio was found to be 16.43854 and reporting odds ratio was found to be 7.6065 for carboplatin-induced pruritis. The value of IC-2SD was 2.9141 indicates middle signal for cisplatin-induced ototoxicity. However, the value of IC-2SD is 2.1995 indicates middle signal for carboplatin-induced pruritis. Conclusion: The signal of ototoxicity coupled with cisplatin and of pruritis coupled with carboplatin was found significant enough to induce ototoxicity and pruritis respectively in the Canadian population.

AB  - Introduction: Diverse algorithms for signal detection exist. However, inconsistent results are often encountered among the algorithms due to different levels of specificity used in defining the adverse events (AEs) and signal threshold. We aimed to explore potential safety signals for two pneumococcal vaccines in a spontaneous reporting database and compare the results and performances among the algorithms. Methods: Safety surveillance was conducted using the Korea national spontaneous reporting database from 1988 to 2017. Safety signals for pneumococcal vaccine and its subtypes were detected using the following the algorithms: disproportionality methods comprising of proportional reporting ratio (PRR), reporting odds ratio (ROR), and information component (IC); empirical Bayes geometric mean (EBGM); and tree-based scan statistics (TSS). Moreover, the performances of these algorithms were measured by comparing detected signals with the known AEs or pneumococcal vaccines (reference standard). Results: Among 10,380 vaccine-related AEs, 1135 reports and 101 AE terms were reported following pneumococcal vaccine. IC generated the most safety signals for pneumococcal vaccine (40/101), followed by PRR and ROR (19/101 each), TSS (15/101), and EBGM (1/101). Similar results were observed for its subtypes. Cellulitis was the only AE detected by all algorithms for pneumococcal vaccine. TSS showed the best balance in the performance: the highest in accuracy, negative predictive value, and area under the curve (70.3%, 67.4%, and 64.2%). Conclusion: Discrepancy in the number of detected signals was observed between algorithms. EBGM and TSS calibrated noise better than disproportionality methods, and TSS showed balanced performance. Nonetheless, these results should be interpreted with caution due to a lack of a gold standard for signal detection.

AB  - . The increase of social media usage across the globe has fueled efforts in digital epidemiology for mining valuable information such as medication use, adverse drug effects and reports of viral infections that directly and indirectly affect population health. Such information can, however, be scarce, hard to find and mostly expressed in very colloquial language. In this work, we focus on a fundamental problem that enables social media mining for disease monitoring. We present and make available SEED, a natural language processing approach to detect symptom and disease mentions from social media data obtained from platforms such as Twitter and DailyStrength, and to normalize them into UMLS terminology. Using multi-corpus training and deep learning models, the tool achieves an overall F1 score of 0.86 for extracting mentions of symptoms on a health forum dataset and an F1 score of 0.72 on a balanced Twitter dataset, significantly improving over previous, more narrowly defined, approaches on the same datasets. We apply the tool on Twitter posts that report COVID19 symptoms to quantify whether the SEED system can extract symptoms absent in the training data. The study results also draw attention to the potential of multi-corpus training for performance improvements and the need for continual training on newly obtained data for consistent performance amidst the ever-changing nature of the social media vocabulary.

AB  - Identifying drug-drug interactions (DDIs) is a critical enabler for reducing adverse drug events and improving patient safety. Generating proper DDI alerts during prescribing workflow has the potential to prevent DDI-related adverse events. However, the implementation of DDI alerting system remains a challenge as users are experiencing alert overload which causes alert fatigue. One strategy to optimize the current system is to establish a list of high-priority DDIs for alerting purposes, though it is a resource-intensive task. In this study, we propose a machine learning framework to extract useful features from the FDA adverse event reports and then identify potential high-priority DDIs using an autoencoder-based semi-supervised learning algorithm. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of using adverse event feature representations in differentiating high- and low-priority DDIs. Additionally, the proposed algorithm utilizes stacked autoencoders and weighted support vector machine for boosting classification performance, which outperforms other competing methods in terms of F-measure and AUC score. This framework integrates multiple information sources, leverages domain knowledge and clinical evidence, and provides a practical approach for pre-screening high-priority DDI candidates for medication alerts.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Social media is a useful platform to share health-related information due to its vast reach. This makes it a good candidate for public-health monitoring tasks, specifically for pharmacovigilance. We study the problem of extraction of Adverse-Drug-Reaction (ADR) mentions from social media, particularly from Twitter. Medical information extraction from social media is challenging, mainly due to short and highly informal nature of text, as compared to more technical and formal medical reports. METHODS: Current methods in ADR mention extraction rely on supervised learning methods, which suffer from labeled data scarcity problem. The state-of-the-art method uses deep neural networks, specifically a class of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) which is Long-Short-Term-Memory network (LSTM). Deep neural networks, due to their large number of free parameters rely heavily on large annotated corpora for learning the end task. But in the real-world, it is hard to get large labeled data, mainly due to the heavy cost associated with the manual annotation. RESULTS: To this end, we propose a novel semi-supervised learning based RNN model, which can leverage unlabeled data also present in abundance on social media. Through experiments we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, achieving state-of-the-art performance in ADR mention extraction. CONCLUSION: In this study, we tackle the problem of labeled data scarcity for Adverse Drug Reaction mention extraction from social media and propose a novel semi-supervised learning based method which can leverage large unlabeled corpus available in abundance on the web. Through empirical study, we demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms fully supervised learning based baseline which relies on large manually annotated corpus for a good performance.

AB  - This paper presents a hybrid ontology-XLNet sentiment analysis classification approach for sentence-level aspects. The main objective of the proposed approach allows discovering user social data considering the extracted in-depth inference about sentiment depending on the context. Thus, in this paper, we investigate the contribution of utilizing the lexicalized ontology to improve the aspect-based sentiment analysis performance through extracting the indirect relationships in user social data. The XLNet model is utilized for extracting the neighboring contextual meaning and concatenating it with each embeddings word to produce a more comprehensive context and enhance feature extraction. In the proposed approach, Bidirectional Long Short Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) networks are used for classifying the aspects in online user reviews. Various experiments considering Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs) discovery are conducted on six drug-related social data real-world datasets to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach using several measures. Obtained experimental results show that the proposed approach outperformed other tested state-of-the-art related approaches through improving feature extraction of unstructured social media text and accordingly improving the overall accuracy of sentiment classification. A significant accuracy of 98% and F-measure of 96.4% are achieved by the proposed ADRs aspect-based sentiment analysis approach.

AB  - Serendipitous drug usage refers to the unexpected relief of comorbid diseases or symptoms when taking medication for a different known indication. Historically, serendipity has contributed significantly to identifying many new drug indications. If patient-reported serendipitous drug usage in social media could be computationally identified, it could help generate and validate drug-repositioning hypotheses. We investigated deep neural network models for mining serendipitous drug usage from social media. We used the word2vec algorithm to construct word-embedding features from drug reviews posted in a WebMD patient forum. We adapted and redesigned the convolutional neural network, long short-term memory network, and convolutional long short-term memory network by adding contextual information extracted from drug-review posts, information-filtering tools, medical ontology, and medical knowledge. We trained, tuned, and evaluated our models with a gold-standard dataset of 15 714 sentences (447 [2.8%] describing serendipitous drug usage). Additionally, we compared our deep neural networks to support vector machine, random forest, and AdaBoost. M1 algorithms. Context information helped to reduce the false-positive rate of deep neural network models. If we used an extremely imbalanced dataset with limited instances of serendipitous drug usage, deep neural network models did not outperform other machine-learning models with n-gram and context features. However, deep neural network models could more effectively use word embedding in feature construction, an advantage that makes them worthy of further investigation. Finally, we implemented natural-language processing and machine-learning methods in a web-based application to help scientists and software developers mine social media for serendipitous drug usage.

AB  - In the recent two decades, data mining methods for signal detection have been developed for drug safety surveillance, using large post-market safety data. Several of these methods assume that the number of reports for each drug-adverse event combination is a Poisson random variable with mean proportional to the unknown reporting rate of the drug-adverse event pair. Here, a Bayesian method based on the Poisson-Dirichlet process (DP) model is proposed for signal detection from large databases, such as the Food and Drug Administration's Adverse Event Reporting System (AERS) database. Instead of using a parametric distribution as a common prior for the reporting rates, as is the case with existing Bayesian or empirical Bayesian methods, a nonparametric prior, namely, the DP, is used. The precision parameter and the baseline distribution of the DP, which characterize the process, are modeled hierarchically. The performance of the Poisson-DP model is compared with some other models, through an intensive simulation study using a Bayesian model selection and frequentist performance characteristics such as type-I error, false discovery rate, sensitivity, and power. For illustration, the proposed model and its extension to address a large amount of zero counts are used to analyze statin drugs for signals using the 2006-2011 AERS data.

AB  - Purpose: We aimed to analyze the surveillance reports of adverse events (AEs) due to different types of pneumococcal vaccines, in addition to detecting and validating signals of pneumococcal vaccines by comparing AEs with labels. Materials and Methods: We analyzed the percentages of AEs according to vaccine type [pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccines (PPSVs) and pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCVs)] in children and adults using data from the Korea Adverse Event Reporting System (KAERS) database from 2005 to 2016. A signal was defined as an AE that met all three indices of data mining: proportional reporting ratio (PRR), reporting odds ratio (ROR), and information component (IC). We validated the detected signals by calculating sensitivity, specificity, as well as positive and negative predictive values of the signals against label information. Results: Of the 39933 AE reports on vaccination, 5718 (7.0%) were related to pneumococcal vaccine. The most frequent AE after vaccination with PPSV was fever (23.9%) in children and injection-site reaction in adults. The most frequent AE after vaccination with PCV in children was pharyngitis (26.2%). In total, 13 AEs met all three indices for signal detection. Among these, hypotension, apathy, sepsis, and increased serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase level were not listed on vaccine labels. In validation analysis, PRR and ROR performed slightly better than IC for adults who were vaccinated with PPSVs. Conclusion: Overall, 13 new signals of PPSVs, including four signals not listed on the labels, were detected. Further research based on additional AE reports is required to confirm the validity of these signals for children.

AB  - Objectives To detect the signals for drospirenone-containing oral contraceptives (DCOCs) and describe the reporting pattern of adverse events (AEs) caused by DCOCs compared with levonorgestrel/desogestrel/gestodene-containing (second/third generation) oral contraceptives. Design A descriptive analysis of claims data. Setting The Korea Institute of Drug Safety & Risk Management-Korea Adverse Event Reporting System Database from 1 February 2008 to 31 December 2017. Outcome measures Signals for DCOCs were identified using three data mining indices. The characteristics, death cases, and the annual pattern of AE reports were compared between DCOCs and second/third generation oral contraceptives. Results Of the 242 DCOC-related AEs, 54 signals were detected and 10 were identified as new signals that were not included in Korea, US and UK label. The newly detected signals include deep vein thrombophlebitis and frequent urination. Serious AEs were more likely to be reported with DCOCs (7.85%) than with second/third generation oral contraceptives (2.92%). Five deaths after use of DCOCs were reported with vascular AEs, such as pulmonary embolism and thrombosis, whereas one death after use of second/third generation oral contraceptives was reported with the cardiac arrest. Conclusions We identified 10 new signals related to DCOCs that were not included in the current label. Additionally, we found higher reports of the deaths and vascular AEs associated with DCOCs than with second/third generation oral contraceptives, which warrants careful monitoring to ensure the safe use of DCOCs.

AB  - Background Adverse events (AEs) not listed on drug labels have recently been reported in young girls vaccinated against HPV, but signal detection related to the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine has never been conducted in South Korea using the Korea Adverse Event Reporting System database of Korea Institute of Drug Safety & Risk Management at Ministry of Food and Drug Safety. Objective To analyze signals associated with HPV vaccines using the Korean spontaneous AEs reporting system and data-mining methods and compare the results to current vaccine label information in South Korea and the United States of America, United Kingdom, European Union, and Japan to detect signals not currently listed on the labels. Setting We evaluated the Korea Institute of Drug Safety & Risk Management database from January 2005 to December 2016. After pre-screening the data, the adjusted total numbers of HPV-related AE reports and AEs were 2566 and 4748 and those of all other vaccine-related AE reports and AEs were 21,878 and 120,688, respectively. Methods Three data mining algorithms (proportional reporting ratio, reporting odds ratio and information component) were used to assess AEs. A signal was defined when the criteria for all three indicators were satisfied. The detected signals were compared to the label information of HPV vaccines from South Korea, the United States of America, United Kingdom, European Union, and Japan. Main outcome measure Signals of AE after HPV vaccination, which met all three data mining indices. Results In this study, we found a total 97 signals of AE after HPV vaccination. Of these, 78 AEs were already present on the HPV vaccine labels of South Korea and the following 19 AEs were not listed: neuralgia, tremor, neuritis, depersonalization, axillary pain, personality disorder, increased salivation, peptic ulcer, circulatory failure, hypotension, peripheral ischemia, cerebral hemorrhage, micturition disorder, facial edema, ovarian cyst, weight increase, pain anxiety, oral edema, and back pain. Moreover, AE information on the current HPV vaccine labels of South Korea, the United States of America, United Kingdom, European Union, and Japan was inconsistent. When comparing the 19 AE signals that were not listed on the drug label in South Korea with the labels from the other countries, neuritis, axillary pain, cerebral hemorrhage, facial edema, pain anxiety, and back pain appreared on the U.S. Food and Drug Administration HPV vaccine labels but not on the United Kingdom labels, and hypotension was listed only on labels in the European Union and Japan. Conclusions South Korea should develop a system for proactively updating HPV labels. These results also suggest potential research directions such as vaccination label expansion, pharmacovigilance studies, and identification of causality in AEs associated with HPV vaccination.

AB  - Purpose: To detect signals of adverse drug events after imipenem treatment using the Korea Institute of Drug Safety & Risk Management-Korea adverse event reporting system database (KIDS-KD). Materials and Methods: We performed data mining using KIDS-KD, which was constructed using spontaneously reported adverse event (AE) reports between December 1988 and June 2014. We detected signals calculated the proportional reporting ratio, reporting odds ratio, and information component of imipenem. We defined a signal as any AE that satisfied all three indices. The signals were compared with drug labels of nine countries. Results: There were 807582 spontaneous AEs reports in the KIDS-KD. Among those, the number of antibiotics related AEs was 192510; 3382 reports were associated with imipenem. The most common imipenem-associated AE was the drug eruption; 353 times. We calculated the signal by comparing with all other antibiotics and drugs; 58 and 53 signals satisfied the three methods. We compared the drug labelling information of nine countries, including the USA, the UK, Japan, Italy, Switzerland, Germany, France, Canada, and South Korea, and discovered that the following signals were currently not included in drug labels: hypokalemia, cardiac arrest, cardiac failure, Parkinson’s syndrome, myocardial infarction, and prostate enlargement. Hypokalemia was an additional signal compared with all other antibiotics, and the other signals were not different compared with all other antibiotics and all other drugs. Conclusion: We detected new signals that were not listed on the drug labels of nine countries. However, further pharmacoepidemiologic research is needed to evaluate the causality of these signals.

AB  - Data mining is critical for signal detection in pharmacovigilance systems. In this study, we compared signals between spontaneous reporting data and health insurance claims data for a socially issued drug, methylphenidate. We implemented data-mining tools for signal detection in both databases: Reporting Odds Ratios (ROR), Proportional Reporting Ratios (PRR), Chi-squared test, and Information Component (IC), in addition to a Relative Risk (RR) tool in the claims database. The claims database generated 15, 15, 36, 1, and 1 adverse drug reactions (ADRs) by ROR, PRR, chi-square, IC, and RR, respectively. The World Health Organization (WHO) spontaneous database generated 91, 91, 137, and 96 ADRs by ROR, PRR, chi-square, and IC, respectively. We found seven potential matching associations from the claims and WHO databases, but only one of them was present in the Korean spontaneous reporting database. In Korea, spontaneous reporting is still underreported and there is a small amount of data for Koreans. Signal comparison between the claims and WHO databases can provide additional regulatory insight. © 2011.

AB  - Among the mechanisms responsible for cognitive dysfunction in chronic kidney disease (CKD) are albuminuria and oxidative stress. However, there may be other causes not yet identified. In fact, the full relevance of CKD patient drug use and its relationship to dementia has hardly been barely investigated. We identified drugs affecting cognitive function in CKD patients by analyzing the spontaneous reporting system in Japan using Association rule mining (ARM) and Bayesian confidence propagation neural network (BCPNN). The signal detection criterion used were as follows: case ≥ 3, lift > 1, conviction > 1 (ARM) and IC(025) >0 (BCPNN). Drugs with more than 20 cases were valaciclovir (lift: 11.21, conviction: 1.28, IC(025): 3.12), amantadine (lift: 19.69, conviction: 1.68, IC(025): 3.05), nalfurafine (lift: 8.35, conviction: 1.19, IC(025): 2.18), pregabalin (lift: 6.05, conviction: 1.12, IC(025): 1.78), and acyclovir (lift: 5.89, conviction: 1.12, IC(025): 1.68). This study is the first report to use a large-scale medical database to identify drugs related to oral drugs-induced dementia in CKD.

AB  - Background Data mining in spontaneous reporting databases has shown that drug-induced liver injury is infrequently reported in children. Objectives Our objectives were to (i) identify drugs potentially associated with acute liver injury (ALI) in children and adolescents using electronic healthcare record (EHR) data; and (ii) to evaluate the significance and novelty of these associations. Methods We identified potential cases of ALI during exposure to any prescribed/dispensed drug for individuals <18 years old from the EU-ADR network, which includes seven databases from three countries, covering the years 1996-2010. Several new methods for signal detection were applied to identify all statistically significant associations between drugs and ALI. A drug was considered statistically significantly associated with ALI, using all other time as a reference category, if the 95 % CI lower band of the relative risk was >1 and in the presence of at least three exposed cases of ALI. Potentially new signals were distinguished from already known associations concerning ALI (whether in adults and/or in the paediatric population) through manual review of published literature and drug product labels. Results The study population comprised 4,838,146 individuals aged <18 years, who contributed an overall 25,575,132 person-years of follow-up. Within this population, we identified 1,015 potential cases of ALI. Overall, 20 positive drug-ALI associations were detected. The associations between ALI and domperidone, flunisolide and human insulin were considered as potentially new signals. Citalopram and cetirizine have been previously described as hepatotoxic in adults but not in children, while all remaining associations were already known in both adults and children. Conclusions Data mining of multiple EHR databases for signal detection confirmed known associations between ALI and several drugs, and identified some potentially new signals in children that require further investigation through formal epidemiologic studies. This study shows that EHRs may complement traditional spontaneous reporting systems for signal detection and strengthening. © 2014 Springer International Publishing Switzerland.

AB  - Purpose: To detect adverse drug reaction (ADR) signals of rosuvastatin compared to other statins with a novel data-mining approach based on relative risk (RR) using the national health insurance claims database, and to evaluate the usefulness of this method as a tool for signal detection. Methods: We used the Health Insurance Review & Assessment Service (HIRA) claims database (Seoul, Korea). Serious adverse events (SAE) were defined as any diagnostic code at the time of hospitalization within 12 weeks from a statin prescription date, regardless of causality. Among statin users, RRs were calculated to compare the proportion of rosuvastatin-specific SAE pairs for rosuvastatin users with the corresponding proportion of drug-SAE pairs for users of other statins. Any SAE for which the lower limit of the RR's 95% confidence interval was greater than 1 was defined as a signal. All detected signals were reviewed to determine whether the signals corresponded with published adverse events (AEs) exclusive to rosuvastatin. Results: Among 96 236 elderly outpatients who received rosuvastatin, or other statins, from January 2005 to September 2005, 40 304 drug-SAE pairs and 376 SAEs were observed. Twenty-five (6.6%) SAEs were detected as signals by the RR-based data-mining approach. Among the 13 references AEs published to be exclusive to rosuvastatin, 8 (61.5%) were found to correspond with the detected signals with a positive predictive value (PPV) of 32%. Conclusions: The RR-based data-mining approach successfully detected signals for rosuvastatin using a national health insurance claims database. This approach could be useful for safety surveillance of marketed products. Copyright © 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Purpose: Pregabalin is a gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) analogue approved for the treatment of epilepsy, neuropathic pain and generalised anxiety disorder. As a GABA analogue, there has been some concern about an abuse liability. We aimed to investigate the possible abuse liability of pregabalin. Methods: By applying a Bayesian data-mining algorithm to reports of possible drug abuse or addiction in the Swedish national register of adverse drug reactions (SWEDIS), we calculated the information component (IC) for pregabalin and reports of abuse and addiction. Results: Out of 198 reports indicative of abuse or addiction to any drug, 16 concerned pregabalin. The IC became significantly elevated in the fourth quarter of 2008, rising to 3.99 (95% confidence interval 3.21-4.59) at the end of 2009. Conclusion: Based on the signal from the present study, we conclude that pregabalin is likely to be associated with an abuse potential. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Background and Objectives: Schizophrenia is a severe public health problem and one of the top ten causes of disability, affecting about 1.1% of the world’s population. Paliperidone is a new atypical antipsychotic used to treat schizophrenia. Several case reports about unexpected adverse drug reactions of paliperidone have been consistently reported around the world. The purpose of this study was to detect signals of adverse events (AEs) after paliperidone treatment using the Korea Institute of Drug Safety and Risk Management–Korea Adverse Event Reporting System database (KIDS-KD). Methods: We applied data-mining techniques based on a disproportionality analysis to KIDS-KD consisting of spontaneously reported AE reports related to atypical antipsychotics between January 2009 and December 2018. We calculated three data-mining indices of paliperidone compared to all other atypical antipsychotics. We defined signals that satisfied all three criteria of the indices. We checked if the signals identified were included in the drug labels for South Korea, the USA, the UK, Japan, Germany, and France. Results: The total number of suspected AE reports related to all atypical antipsychotics in the KIDS-KD from January 2009 to December 2018 was 43,970. Among those, the number of AE reports related to paliperidone was 9453. Overall, 13 signals such as seborrhea, hallucination, obesity, gingivitis, and intervertebral disorder were classified into newly detected meaningful signals. Conclusion: We detected new AE signals of paliperidone that were not listed on the drug labels of six countries, and many that were related to psychotic symptoms, metabolic problems, and endocrine disorders.

AB  - Purpose: Data mining has been introduced as one of the most useful methods for signal detection by spontaneous reports, but data mining is not always effective in detecting all safety issues. To investigate appropriate situations in which data mining is effective in routine signal detection activities, we analyzed the characteristics of signals that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) identified from the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS). Methods: Among the signals that the FDA identified from the FAERS between 2008 1Q and 2014 4Q, we selected 233 signals to evaluate in this study. We conducted a disproportionality analysis and classified these signals into two groups according to the presence or absence of statistical significance in the reporting odds ratio (ROR). Then, we compared the two groups based on the characteristics of the suspected drugs and adverse events (AEs). Results: Safety signals were most frequently identified for new drugs that had been on the market for less than 5 years, but some signals were still identified for old drugs (≥20 years), and most of them were statistically significant. The proportion of the signals for “serious” events was significantly higher in the group of nonsignals by ROR (Fisher's exact test, P = 0.032). Conclusions: Data mining was shown to be effective in the following situations: (1) early detection of safety issues for newly marketed drugs, (2) continuous monitoring of safety issues for old drugs, and (3) signal detection of nonserious AEs, to which little attention is usually given.

AB  - Predicting adverse drug effects is difficult which is focused in various research works that focus on predicting the adverse effects of drugs based user reviews gathered from the social media. However those research works cannot accurately predict the user opinions side effects. These problems are resolved in the proposed research work by introducing the framework called "adverse drug effect aware drug recommendation system". This research work focus on the online reviews about the drug reaction which is gathered from the twitter social media website. These reviews are analyzed to find the reaction of users in terms of positive reaction or negative reaction based on adverse effects. In this work training is done on the tweet data corpus downloaded from online to learn the negative and positive impact words. Initially preprocessing is done on the retrieved data reviews to eliminate unwanted words and result with only required data contents without noises and repeated data by using successor variety stemmer's algorithm. After preprocessing, optimal feature selection is done on the preprocessed terms to select the most optimal terms that represent the drug reactions by using hybrid generic particle swarm optimization algorithm. Finally classification is done by using improved transductive support vector machine algorithm. The entire proposed work is simulated and analyzed in the matlab simulation environment from which it can be proved that the proposed research work tends to increased performance than the existing research methodologies.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Social media may complement traditional data sources to answer comparative effectiveness/safety questions after medication licensure. METHODS: The Treato platform was used to analyze all publicly available social media data including Facebook, blogs, and discussion boards for posts mentioning inflammatory arthritis (e.g. rheumatoid, psoriatic). Safety events were self-reported by patients and mapped to medical ontologies, resolving synonyms. Disease and symptom-related treatment indications were manually redacted. The units of analysis were unique terms in posts. Pre-specified conditions (e.g. herpes zoster (HZ)) were selected based upon safety signals from clinical trials and reported as pairwise odds ratios (ORs); drugs were compared with Fisher's exact test. Empirically identified events were analyzed using disproportionality analysis and reported as relative reporting ratios (RRRs). The accuracy of a natural language processing (NLP) classifier to identify cases of shingles associated with arthritis medications was assessed. RESULTS: As of October 2015, there were 785,656 arthritis-related posts. Posts were predominantly US posts (75%) from patient authors (87%) under 40 years of age (61%). For HZ posts (n = 1815), ORs were significantly increased with tofacitinib versus other rheumatoid arthritis therapies. ORs for mentions of perforated bowel (n = 13) were higher with tocilizumab versus other therapies. RRRs associated with tofacitinib were highest in conditions related to baldness and hair regrowth, infections and cancer. The NLP classifier had a positive predictive value of 91% to identify HZ. There was a threefold increase in posts following television direct-to-consumer advertisement (p = 0.04); posts expressing medication safety concerns were significantly more frequent than favorable posts. CONCLUSION: Social media is a challenging yet promising data source that may complement traditional approaches for comparative effectiveness research for new medications.

AB  - Introduction: Post-marketing safety surveillance primarily relies on data from spontaneous adverse event reports, medical literature, and observational databases. Limitations of these data sources include potential under-reporting, lack of geographic diversity, and time lag between event occurrence and discovery. There is growing interest in exploring the use of social media (‘social listening’) to supplement established approaches for pharmacovigilance. Although social listening is commonly used for commercial purposes, there are only anecdotal reports of its use in pharmacovigilance. Health information posted online by patients is often publicly available, representing an untapped source of post-marketing safety data that could supplement data from existing sources. Objectives: The objective of this paper is to describe one methodology that could help unlock the potential of social media for safety surveillance. Methods: A third-party vendor acquired 24 months of publicly available Facebook and Twitter data, then processed the data by standardizing drug names and vernacular symptoms, removing duplicates and noise, masking personally identifiable information, and adding supplemental data to facilitate the review process. The resulting dataset was analyzed for safety and benefit information. Results: In Twitter, a total of 6,441,679 Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA®) Preferred Terms (PTs) representing 702 individual PTs were discussed in the same post as a drug compared with 15,650,108 total PTs representing 946 individual PTs in Facebook. Further analysis revealed that 26 % of posts also contained benefit information. Conclusion: Social media listening is an important tool to augment post-marketing safety surveillance. Much work remains to determine best practices for using this rapidly evolving data source.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Prescription medication overdose is the fastest growing drug-related problem in the USA. The growing nature of this problem necessitates the implementation of improved monitoring strategies for investigating the prevalence and patterns of abuse of specific medications. OBJECTIVES: Our primary aims were to assess the possibility of utilizing social media as a resource for automatic monitoring of prescription medication abuse and to devise an automatic classification technique that can identify potentially abuse-indicating user posts. METHODS: We collected Twitter user posts (tweets) associated with three commonly abused medications (Adderall(®), oxycodone, and quetiapine). We manually annotated 6400 tweets mentioning these three medications and a control medication (metformin) that is not the subject of abuse due to its mechanism of action. We performed quantitative and qualitative analyses of the annotated data to determine whether posts on Twitter contain signals of prescription medication abuse. Finally, we designed an automatic supervised classification technique to distinguish posts containing signals of medication abuse from those that do not and assessed the utility of Twitter in investigating patterns of abuse over time. RESULTS: Our analyses show that clear signals of medication abuse can be drawn from Twitter posts and the percentage of tweets containing abuse signals are significantly higher for the three case medications (Adderall(®): 23 %, quetiapine: 5.0 %, oxycodone: 12 %) than the proportion for the control medication (metformin: 0.3 %). Our automatic classification approach achieves 82 % accuracy overall (medication abuse class recall: 0.51, precision: 0.41, F measure: 0.46). To illustrate the utility of automatic classification, we show how the classification data can be used to analyze abuse patterns over time. CONCLUSION: Our study indicates that social media can be a crucial resource for obtaining abuse-related information for medications, and that automatic approaches involving supervised classification and natural language processing hold promises for essential future monitoring and intervention tasks.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: There is increasing interest in social digital media (SDM) as a data source for pharmacovigilance activities; however, SDM is considered a low information content data source for safety data. Given that pharmacovigilance itself operates in a high-noise, lower-validity environment without objective 'gold standards' beyond process definitions, the introduction of large volumes of SDM into the pharmacovigilance workflow has the potential to exacerbate issues with limited manual resources to perform adverse event identification and processing. Recent advances in medical informatics have resulted in methods for developing programs which can assist human experts in the detection of valid individual case safety reports (ICSRs) within SDM. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we developed rule-based and machine learning (ML) models for classifying ICSRs from SDM and compared their performance with that of human pharmacovigilance experts. METHODS: We used a random sampling from a collection of 311,189 SDM posts that mentioned Roche products and brands in combination with common medical and scientific terms sourced from Twitter, Tumblr, Facebook, and a spectrum of news media blogs to develop and evaluate three iterations of an automated ICSR classifier. The ICSR classifier models consisted of sub-components to annotate the relevant ICSR elements and a component to make the final decision on the validity of the ICSR. Agreement with human pharmacovigilance experts was chosen as the preferred performance metric and was evaluated by calculating the Gwet AC1 statistic (gKappa). The best performing model was tested against the Roche global pharmacovigilance expert using a blind dataset and put through a time test of the full 311,189-post dataset. RESULTS: During this effort, the initial strict rule-based approach to ICSR classification resulted in a model with an accuracy of 65% and a gKappa of 46%. Adding an ML-based adverse event annotator improved the accuracy to 74% and gKappa to 60%. This was further improved by the addition of an additional ML ICSR detector. On a blind test set of 2500 posts, the final model demonstrated a gKappa of 78% and an accuracy of 83%. In the time test, it took the final model 48 h to complete a task that would have taken an estimated 44,000 h for human experts to perform. CONCLUSION: The results of this study indicate that an effective and scalable solution to the challenge of ICSR detection in SDM includes a workflow using an automated ML classifier to identify likely ICSRs for further human SME review.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) such as programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4) inhibitors have greatly improved cancer treatment. However, they are associated with immune-related adverse events, including autoimmune diseases (ADs) owing to their immune enhancement effect. As there are few comprehensive studies of ADs by ICIs, it is necessary to analyze the period information of drug-induced ADs. We also assumed that the temporal information may be useful to estimate the similarity of the pathogenic mechanism between spontaneous and ICI-induced ADs. METHODS: A period analysis including the Weibull analysis was performed on ICI-induced ADs using the Japanese Adverse Drug Event Report (JADER) database. For evaluating the similarity of spontaneous and ICI-induced ADs, a hierarchical cluster analysis was conducted to compare the different onset-time ranges. RESULTS: Type 1 diabetes mellitus, autoimmune colitis, and pemphigoid occurred earlier with CTLA-4 inhibitors (median: 46, 29.5 and 28 days, respectively) than with PD-1 inhibitors (> 130 days). Myasthenia gravis had a median time to onset of approximately 1 month, and the risk of onset would increase over time in ipilimumab combination therapy. This result reveals ADs that require attention. Using cluster analysis, we estimated six clusters with different patterns of onset times. Based on these results and a detailed previous research survey, the possible pathogenesis of drug-induced ADs was also discussed. CONCLUSIONS: This paper describes risk profiles with temporal information of ICI-induced ADs and proposes certain indicators for deciphering the mechanism of AD onset.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Adverse event reports (AERs) submitted to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) were reviewed to assess the muscular and renal adverse events induced by the administration of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins) and to attempt to determine the rank-order of the association. METHODS: After a revision of arbitrary drug names and the deletion of duplicated submissions, AERs involving pravastatin, simvastatin, atorvastatin, or rosuvastatin were analyzed. Authorized pharmacovigilance tools were used for quantitative detection of signals, i.e., drug-associated adverse events, including the proportional reporting ratio, the reporting odds ratio, the information component given by a Bayesian confidence propagation neural network, and the empirical Bayes geometric mean. Myalgia, rhabdomyolysis and an increase in creatine phosphokinase level were focused on as the muscular adverse events, and acute renal failure, non-acute renal failure, and an increase in blood creatinine level as the renal adverse events. RESULTS: Based on 1,644,220 AERs from 2004 to 2009, signals were detected for 4 statins with respect to myalgia, rhabdomyolysis, and an increase in creatine phosphokinase level, but these signals were stronger for rosuvastatin than pravastatin and atorvastatin. Signals were also detected for acute renal failure, though in the case of atorvastatin, the association was marginal, and furthermore, a signal was not detected for non-acute renal failure or for an increase in blood creatinine level. CONCLUSIONS: Data mining of the FDA's adverse event reporting system, AERS, is useful for examining statin-associated muscular and renal adverse events. The data strongly suggest the necessity of well-organized clinical studies with respect to statin-associated adverse events.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Data masking is an inborn defect of measures of disproportionality in adverse drug reactions (ADRs) signal detection. Many previous studies can be roughly classified into three categories: data removal, regression and stratification. However, frequency differences of adverse drug events (ADEs) reports, which would be an important factor of masking, were not considered in these methods. The aim of this study is to explore a novel stratification method for minimizing the impact of frequency differences on real signals masking. METHODS: Reports in the Chinese Spontaneous Reporting Database (CSRD) between 2010 and 2011 were selected. The overall dataset was stratified into some clusters by the frequency of drugs, ADRs, and drug-event combinations (DECs) in sequence. K-means clustering was used to conduct stratification according to data distribution characteristics. The Information Component (IC) was adopted for signal detection in each cluster respectively. By extracting ADRs from drug product labeling, a reference database was introduced for performance evaluation based on Recall, Precision and F-measure. In addition, some DECs from the Adverse Drug Reactions Information Bulletin (ADRIB) issued by CFDA were collected for further reliability evaluation. RESULTS: With stratification, the study dataset was divided into 21 clusters, among which the frequency of DRUGs, ADRs or DECs followed the similar order of magnitude respectively. Recall increased by 34.95% from 29.93 to 40.39%, Precision reduced by 10.52% from 54.56 to 48.82%, while F-measure increased by 14.39% from 38.65 to 44.21%. According to ADRIB after 2011, 5 DECs related to Potassium Magnesium Aspartate, 61 DECs related to Levofloxacin Hydrochloride and 26 DECs related to Cefazolin were highlighted. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed method is effectively and reliably for the minimization of data masking effect in signal detection. Considering the decrease of Precision, it is suggested to be a supplement rather than an alternative to non-stratification method.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This article presents our approaches to extraction of medications and associated adverse drug events (ADEs) from clinical documents, which is the second track of the 2018 National NLP Clinical Challenges (n2c2) shared task. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The clinical corpus used in this study was from the MIMIC-III database and the organizers annotated 303 documents for training and 202 for testing. Our system consists of 2 components: a named entity recognition (NER) and a relation classification (RC) component. For each component, we implemented deep learning-based approaches (eg, BI-LSTM-CRF) and compared them with traditional machine learning approaches, namely, conditional random fields for NER and support vector machines for RC, respectively. In addition, we developed a deep learning-based joint model that recognizes ADEs and their relations to medications in 1 step using a sequence labeling approach. To further improve the performance, we also investigated different ensemble approaches to generating optimal performance by combining outputs from multiple approaches. RESULTS: Our best-performing systems achieved F1 scores of 93.45% for NER, 96.30% for RC, and 89.05% for end-to-end evaluation, which ranked #2, #1, and #1 among all participants, respectively. Additional evaluations show that the deep learning-based approaches did outperform traditional machine learning algorithms in both NER and RC. The joint model that simultaneously recognizes ADEs and their relations to medications also achieved the best performance on RC, indicating its promise for relation extraction. CONCLUSION: In this study, we developed deep learning approaches for extracting medications and their attributes such as ADEs, and demonstrated its superior performance compared with traditional machine learning algorithms, indicating its uses in broader NER and RC tasks in the medical domain.

AB  - Many patients require multi-drug combinations, and adverse event profiles reflect not only the effects of individual drugs but also drug-drug interactions. Although there are several algorithms for detecting drug-drug interaction signals, a simple analysis model is required for early detection of adverse events. Recently, there have been reports of detecting signals of drug-drug interactions using subset analysis, but appropriate detection criterion may not have been used. In this study, we presented and verified an appropriate criterion. The data source used was the Japanese Adverse Drug Event Report (JADER) database; "hypothetical" true data were generated through a combination of signals detected by three detection algorithms. The accuracy of the signal detection of the analytic model under investigation was verified using indicators used in machine learning. The newly proposed subset analysis confirmed that the signal detection was improved, compared with signal detection in the previous subset analysis, on the basis of the indicators of Accuracy (0.584 to 0.809), Precision (= Positive predictive value; PPV) (0.302 to 0.596), Specificity (0.583 to 0.878), Youden's index (0.170 to 0.465), F-measure (0.399 to 0.592), and Negative predictive value (NPV) (0.821 to 0.874). The previous subset analysis detected many false drug-drug interaction signals. Although the newly proposed subset analysis provides slightly lower detection accuracy for drug-drug interaction signals compared to signals compared to the Ω shrinkage measure model, the criteria used in the newly subset analysis significantly reduced the amount of falsely detected signals found in the previous subset analysis.

AB  - Big longitudinal observational medical data potentially hold a wealth of information and have been recognised as potential sources for gaining new drug safety knowledge. Unfortunately there are many complexities and underlying issues when analysing longitudinal observational data. Due to these complexities, existing methods for large-scale detection of negative side effects using observational data all tend to have issues distinguishing between association and causality. New methods that can better discriminate causal and non-causal relationships need to be developed to fully utilise the data. In this paper we propose using a set of causality considerations developed by the epidemiologist Bradford Hill as a basis for engineering features that enable the application of supervised learning for the problem of detecting negative side effects. The Bradford Hill considerations look at various perspectives of a drug and outcome relationship to determine whether it shows causal traits. We taught a classifier to find patterns within these perspectives and it learned to discriminate between association and causality. The novelty of this research is the combination of supervised learning and Bradford Hill's causality considerations to automate the Bradford Hill's causality assessment. We evaluated the framework on a drug safety gold standard known as the observational medical outcomes partnership's non-specified association reference set. The methodology obtained excellent discrimination ability with area under the curves ranging between 0.792 and 0.940 (existing method optimal: 0.73) and a mean average precision of 0.640 (existing method optimal: 0.141). The proposed features can be calculated efficiently and be readily updated, making the framework suitable for big observational data.

AB  - MOTIVATION: Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality and thus should be detected early to reduce consequences on health outcomes. Medication dispensing data are comprehensive sources of information about medicine uses that can be utilized for the signal detection of ADRs. Sequence symmetry analysis (SSA) has been employed in previous studies to detect signals of ADRs from medication dispensing data, but it has a moderate sensitivity and tends to miss some ADR signals. With successful applications in various areas, supervised machine learning (SML) methods are promising in detecting ADR signals. Gold standards of known ADRs and non- ADRs from previous studies create opportunities to take into account additional domain knowledge to improve ADR signal detection with SML. OBJECTIVE: We assess the utility of SML as a signal detection tool for ADRs in medication dispensing data with the consideration of domain knowledge from DrugBank and MedDRA. We compare the best performing SML method with SSA. METHODS: We model the ADR signal detection problem as a supervised machine learning problem by linking medication dispensing data with domain knowledge bases. Suspected ADR signals are extracted from the Australian Pharmaceutical Benefit Scheme (PBS) medication dispensing data from 2013 to 2016. We construct predictive features for each signal candidate based on its occurrences in medication dispensing data as well as its pharmacological properties. Pharmaceutical knowledge bases including DrugBank and MedDRA are employed to provide pharmacological features for a signal candidate. Given a gold standard of known ADRs and non-ADRs, SML learns to differentiate between known ADRs and non-ADRs based on their combined predictive features from linked sources, and then predicts whether a new case is a potential ADR signal. RESULTS: We evaluate the performance of six widely used SML methods with two gold standards of known ADRs and non-ADRs from previous studies. On average, gradient boosting classifier achieves the sensitivity of 77%, specificity of 81%, positive predictive value of 76%, negative predictive value of 82%, area under precision-recall curve of 81%, and area under receiver operating characteristic curve of 82%, most of which are higher than in other SML methods. In particular, gradient boosting classifier has 21% higher sensitivity than and comparable specificity with SSA. Furthermore, gradient boosting classifier detects 10% more unknown potential ADR signals than SSA. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates that gradient boosting classifier is a promising supervised signal detection tool for ADRs in medication dispensing data to complement SSA.

AB  - PURPOSE: Current guidelines recommend α1-adrenoreceptor blockers (A1Bs) for treating lower urinary tract symptoms suggestive of benign prostatic hyperplasia, but their adverse effects can be problematic. In this study, reports submitted to the US Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) between 1997 and 2011 were reviewed to assess the safety profiles of A1Bs. METHODS: After deleting duplicated submissions and revising arbitrary drug names, reports involving A1Bs for male patients were analyzed. Data mining algorisms were used for the quantitative detection of signals, where a signal represents an association between a drug and an adverse event or a drug-associated adverse event, including the proportional reporting ratio, reporting odds ratio, information component given by a Bayesian confidence propagation neural network, and empirical Bayes geometric mean. RESULTS: The total number of reports used was 1,260,182. Signal scores suggested the associations of alfuzosin, doxazosin, tamsulosin, and terazosin with dizziness/vertigo, orthostatic hypotension, erectile dysfunction, ejaculation dysfunction (EjD), thirst/dry mouth, and constipation; however, reports on naftopidil, silodosin, and urapidil were not enough to compare with the other 4 A1Bs. Signal scores for EjD were higher for tamsulosin, and those for dizziness/vertigo were lower for doxazosin than for the other 3 drugs. CONCLUSIONS: Tamsulosin-associated EjD, which was found in clinical studies, was reproduced in this analysis with markedly higher signal scores, and these results strongly suggest the necessity of well-organized clinical studies on A1B-associated adverse events.

AB  - This current investigation was aimed to generate signals for adverse events (AEs) of darunavir-containing agents by data mining using the US Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS). All AE reports for darunavir, darunavir/ritonavir, or darunavir/cobicistat between July 2006 and December 2019 were identified. The reporting Odds Ratio (ROR), proportional reporting ratio (PRR), and Bayesian confidence propagation neural network (BCPNN) were used to detect the risk signals. A suspicious signal was generated only if the results of the three algorithms were all positive. A total of 10,756 reports were identified commonly observed in hepatobiliary, endocrine, cardiovascular, musculoskeletal, gastrointestinal, metabolic, and nutrition system. 40 suspicious signals were generated, and therein 20 signals were not included in the label. Severe high signals (i.e. progressive extraocular muscle paralysis, acute pancreatitis, exfoliative dermatitis, acquired lipodystrophy and mitochondrial toxicity) were identified. In pregnant women, umbilical cord abnormality, fetal growth restriction, low birth weight, stillbirth, premature rupture of membranes, premature birth and spontaneous abortion showed positive signals. Darunavir and its boosted agents induced AEs in various organs/tissues, and were shown to be possibly associated with multiple adverse pregnant conditions. This study highlighted some novel and severe AEs of darunavir which need to be monitored prospectively.

AB  - "Psychiatric Treatment Adverse Reactions" (PsyTAR) corpus is an annotated corpus that has been developed using patients narrative data for psychiatric medications, particularly SSRIs (Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor) and SNRIs (Serotonin Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitor) medications. This corpus consists of three main components: sentence classification, entity identification, and entity normalization. We split the review posts into sentences and labeled them for presence of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) (2168 sentences), withdrawal symptoms (WDs) (438 sentences), sign/symptoms/illness (SSIs) (789 sentences), drug indications (517), drug effectiveness (EF) (1087 sentences), and drug infectiveness (INF) (337 sentences). In the entity identification phase, we identified and extracted ADRs (4813 mentions), WDs (590 mentions), SSIs (1219 mentions), and DIs (792). In the entity normalization phase, we mapped the identified entities to the corresponding concepts in both UMLS (918 unique concepts) and SNOMED CT (755 unique concepts). Four annotators double coded the sentences and the span of identified entities by strictly following guidelines rules developed for this study. We used the PsyTAR sentence classification component to automatically train a range of supervised machine learning classifiers to identifying text segments with the mentions of ADRs, WDs, DIs, SSIs, EF, and INF. SVMs classifiers had the highest performance with F-Score 0.90. We also measured performance of the cTAKES (clinical Text Analysis and Knowledge Extraction System) in identifying patients' expressions of ADRs and WDs with and without adding PsyTAR dictionary to the core dictionary of cTAKES. Augmenting cTAKES dictionary with PsyTAR improved the F-score cTAKES by 25%. The findings imply that PsyTAR has significant implications for text mining algorithms aimed to identify information about adverse drug events and drug effectiveness from patients' narratives data, by linking the patients' expressions of adverse drug events to medical standard vocabularies. The corpus is publicly available at Zolnoori et al. [30].

AB  - The optimum timing of drug safety data mining for a new drug is uncertain. The objective of this study was to compare cumulative data mining versus mining with sliding time windows. Adverse Event Reporting System data (2001-2005) were studied for 27 drugs. A literature database was used to evaluate signals of disproportionate reporting (SDRs) from an urn model data-mining algorithm. Data mining was applied cumulatively and with sliding time windows from 1 to 4 years in width. Time from SDR generation to the appearance of a publication describing the corresponding adverse event was calculated. Cumulative data mining and 1- to 2-year sliding windows produced the most SDRs for recently approved drugs. In the first postmarketing year, data mining produced SDRs an average of 800 days in advance of publications regarding the corresponding drug-event combination. However, this timing advantage reduced to zero by year 4. The optimum window width for sliding windows should increase with time on the market. Data mining may be most useful for early signal detection during the first 3 years of a drug's postmarketing life. Beyond that, it may be most useful for supporting or weakening hypotheses. © 2009 the American College of Clinical Pharmacology.

AB  - We improved a previous pharmacological target adverse-event (TAE) profile model to predict adverse events (AEs) on US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) drug labels at the time of approval. The new model uses more drugs and features for learning as well as a new algorithm. Comparator drugs sharing similar target activities to a drug of interest were evaluated by aggregating AEs from the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS), FDA drug labels, and medical literature. An ensemble machine learning model was used to evaluate FAERS case count, disproportionality scores, percent of comparator drug labels with a specific AE, and percent of comparator drugs with the reports of the event in the literature. Overall classifier performance was F1 of 0.71, area under the precision-recall curve of 0.78, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.87. TAE analysis continues to show promise as a method to predict adverse events at the time of approval.

AB  - Background: A rarely used opportunity in pharmacovigilance is data mining for adverse drug reactions (ADRs) in population-based healthcare databases. Objective: To evaluate the potential of data mining for ADRs in the nationwide Danish healthcare databases. We specifically considered hospital contacts following measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) immunization. Methods: We constructed a cohort consisting of all children born in Denmark from 1995 to 2007 (n = 918 831) with individual-level linked data on childhood vaccinations and hospital contacts from the nationwide Danish healthcare databases. We applied a cohort-based data mining methodology to compare the observed versus the expected incidence of adverse event in different time periods relative to immunization. With this approach we evaluated temporal associations between MMR immunization and 5915 different diagnoses occurring in the cohort. In order to evaluate the ability of our approach to detect signals, we singled out a set of four adverse events previously recognized as being associated with the MMR vaccine. Results: We were able to link a total of 3 162 251 hospital contacts and 5915 different diagnoses to the children in the cohort. Previously recognized temporal associations between adverse events (febrile convulsions, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, lymphadenopathy and rash) and MMR immunization were identified in the Danish databases by our method. Conclusions: Data mining in the Danish population-based healthcare databases provides adequate ability to detect adverse events. Pharmacovigilance using electronic healthcare databases holds potential as an important supplement to traditional pharmacovigilance. © 2010 Adis Data Information BV. All rights reserved.

AB  - Pharmacovigilance regulations and guidelines state that literature databases should be searched at least monthly to detect safety signals from the published literature. In addition, periodic safety update reports (PSURs) should contain a summary and references from reports in the literature containing important safety findings. The volume of literature that needs to be reviewed is high, making manual review of the abstracts a resource-intensive process. Text Analytics for Surveillance (TAS) was developed as a software tool to improve the efficiency and consistency of the routine literature evaluation, tracking, and documentation process within a regulated pharmaceutical environment. Text Analytics for Surveillance uses natural language processing and includes a novel application of text analytics to assist with identifying the most relevant articles in the process of scheduled surveillance of published literature by enhancing categorized review, introducing consistency of approach, ensuring rigorous recording of activities, and aiding profile analysis. There are clear opportunities to reuse the TAS approach within other scientific and business areas where regular literature evaluation is important. © Drug Information Association 2012.

AB  - Pharmacovigilance (PV) is defined by the World Health Organization as the science and activities related to the detection, assessment, understanding and prevention of adverse effects or any other drug-related problem. An essential aspect in PV is to acquire knowledge about Drug-Drug Interactions (DDIs). The shared tasks on DDI-Extraction organized in 2011 and 2013 have pointed out the importance of this issue and provided benchmarks for: Drug Name Recognition, DDI extraction and DDI classification. In this paper, we present our text mining systems for these tasks and evaluate their results on the DDI-Extraction benchmarks. Our systems rely on machine learning techniques using both feature-based and kernel-based methods. The obtained results for drug name recognition are encouraging. For DDI-Extraction, our hybrid system combining a feature-based method and a kernel-based method was ranked second in the DDI-Extraction-2011 challenge, and our two-step system for DDI detection and classification was ranked first in the DDI-Extraction-2013 task at SemEval. We discuss our methods and results and give pointers to future work.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The US Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) collects spontaneous reports of adverse events following vaccination. Medical officers review the reports and often apply standardized case definitions, such as those developed by the Brighton Collaboration. Our objective was to demonstrate a multi-level text mining approach for automated text classification of VAERS reports that could potentially reduce human workload. DESIGN: We selected 6034 VAERS reports for H1N1 vaccine that were classified by medical officers as potentially positive (N(pos)=237) or negative for anaphylaxis. We created a categorized corpus of text files that included the class label and the symptom text field of each report. A validation set of 1100 labeled text files was also used. Text mining techniques were applied to extract three feature sets for important keywords, low- and high-level patterns. A rule-based classifier processed the high-level feature representation, while several machine learning classifiers were trained for the remaining two feature representations. MEASUREMENTS: Classifiers' performance was evaluated by macro-averaging recall, precision, and F-measure, and Friedman's test; misclassification error rate analysis was also performed. RESULTS: Rule-based classifier, boosted trees, and weighted support vector machines performed well in terms of macro-recall, however at the expense of a higher mean misclassification error rate. The rule-based classifier performed very well in terms of average sensitivity and specificity (79.05% and 94.80%, respectively). CONCLUSION: Our validated results showed the possibility of developing effective medical text classifiers for VAERS reports by combining text mining with informative feature selection; this strategy has the potential to reduce reviewer workload considerably.

AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: To investigate reports of thrombotic events associated with the use of C1 esterase inhibitor products in patients with hereditary angioedema in the United States. DESIGN: Retrospective data mining analysis. SOURCE: The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) adverse event reporting system (AERS) database. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Case reports of C1 esterase inhibitor products, thrombotic events, and C1 esterase inhibitor product-associated thrombotic events (i.e., combination cases) were extracted from the AERS database, using the time frames of each respective product's FDA approval date through the second quarter of 2011. Bayesian statistical methodology within the neural network architecture was implemented to identify potential signals of a drug-associated adverse event. A potential signal is generated when the lower limit of the 95% 2-sided confidence interval of the information component, denoted by IC₀₂₅ , is greater than zero. This suggests that the particular drug-associated adverse event was reported to the database more often than statistically expected from reports available in the database. Ten combination cases of thrombotic events associated with the use of one C1 esterase inhibitor product (Cinryze) were identified in patients with hereditary angioedema. A potential signal demonstrated by an IC₀₂₅ value greater than zero (IC₀₂₅ = 2.91) was generated for these combination cases. CONCLUSION: The extracted cases from the AERS indicate continuing reports of thrombotic events associated with the use of one C1 esterase inhibitor product among patients with hereditary angioedema. The AERS is incapable of establishing a causal link and detecting the true frequency of an adverse event associated with a drug; however, potential signals of C1 esterase inhibitor product-associated thrombotic events among patients with hereditary angioedema were identified in the extracted combination cases.

AB  - What is known and objective: The adverse events of thyroid dysfunction caused by the use of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (VEGFR-TKIs) have not been confirmed in a real-world investigation. The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between thyroid dysfunction and treatment using Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved VEGFR-TKIs. Methods: Four data-mining algorithms were employed to detect thyroid dysfunction signals for VEGFR-TKIs, using data in the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database from 68 quarters. MySQL Workbench and R were used to conduct statistical analysis. Results and Discussion: We identified 32679 reports of thyroid dysfunction, of which 1567 listed VEGFR-TKIs as the primary suspected drugs. All four algorithms showed that the strength of the signals for hypothyroidism were greater than those for hyperthyroidism, for all the VEGFR-TKIs. In most cases, the median appearance time was within 100 days of initiation of VEGFR-TKIs therapy, except in the case of ponatinib. This indicated the need to actively identify and manage thyroid dysfunction during the early stages of VEGFR-TKIs treatment. What is new and conclusions: This study systematically identified the pharmacovigilance signals of thyroid dysfunction associated with the use of VEGFR-TKIs, using the FAERS database.

AB  - Signal detection remains a cornerstone activity of pharmacovigilance. Routine quantitative signal detection primarily focuses on screening of spontaneous reports. In striving to enhance quantitative signal detection capability further, other data streams are being considered for their potential contribution as sources of emerging signals, one of which is longitudinal observational databases, including electronic medical record (EMR) and transactional insurance claims databases. Quantitative signal detection on such databases is a nascent field-with published methods being primarily based either on individual metrics, which may not effectively represent the complexity of the longitudinal records and their necessary variation for analysis for drug-outcome pairs, or on visualization discovery approaches leveraging multiple aspects of the records, which are not particularly tractable to high-throughput hypothesis-free signal detection. One extensively tested example of the latter is chronographs. We apply a disturbance detection algorithm to chronographs using UK EMR The Health Improvement Network (THIN) data. The algorithm utilizes autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA)-based time series methodology designed to find disturbances that occur outside the normal pattern trends of the ARIMA model for the chronograph. Chronographs currently highlight drug-event pairs as potentially worthy of further clinical assessment, via filter-based increases in disproportionality scores from before to after the index drug exposure, tested across a range of case and control windows. We replicate the findings on six exemplar chronographs from a previous publication, and show how disturbances can be effectively detected across this set of pairs. Further, 692 disturbances were detected in analysis of all 384 individual READ code outcomes ever recorded 50 or more times for patients prescribed sibutramine. The disturbances are algorithmically further broken into subsets of clinical interest. Overall, the disturbance algorithm approach shows promising capacity for detecting outliers, and shows tractability of the algorithmic approach for large-scale screening. The method offers an array of pattern types for detection and clinical review.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Systems-centered root cause analysis (RCA) of patient safety events presents unique advantages as it aims to disclose vulnerabilities of healthcare systems. However, the increasing number of collected events poses the problems of low efficiency and information overload for traditional RCA. OBJECTIVES: This study aims to improve systems-centered RCA by developing optimized information extraction and presentation. METHODS: We experimented supervised machine-learning methods to extract safety-related information from 3333 de-identified patient safety event reports from two independent sources. Based on the extracted information, we further evaluated how optimized information presentation could help facilitate the disclosure of system vulnerabilities in traditional RCA. RESULTS: Multilabel text classification is effective in identifying safety-related information from the narrative description of patient safety events. The Pruned Sets in conjunction with Naïve Bayes are the outperformed algorithm in one dataset, with an overall F score of 60.0 % and the highest F score of 96.0 % for identifying "Adverse Drug Reaction". The Classifier Chains in conjunction with Naïve Bayes are the outperformed algorithm in another dataset, with an overall F score of 43.2 % and the highest F score of 64.0 % for identifying "Medication". During the RCA, human experts applied the optimized presentation of information which showed advantages of identifying system vulnerabilities. CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrated the feasibility of using multilabel text classification for identifying safety-related information from the narrative description of patient safety events. The extracted information when grouped by safety-related information can better aid human experts to conduct systems-centered RCA and disclose system vulnerabilities.

AB  - Drug-related adverse events pose substantial risks to patients who consume post-market or Drug-related adverse events pose substantial risks to patients who consume post-market or investigational drugs. Early detection of adverse events benefits not only the drug regulators, but also the manufacturers for pharmacovigilance. Existing methods rely on patients' "spontaneous" self-reports that attest problems. The increasing popularity of social media platforms like the Twitter presents us a new information source for finding potential adverse events. Given the high frequency of user updates, mining Twitter messages can lead us to real-time pharmacovigilance. In this paper, we describe an approach to find drug users and potential adverse events by analyzing the content of twitter messages utilizing Natural Language Processing (NLP) and to build Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers. Due to the size nature of the dataset (i.e., 2 billion Tweets), the experiments were conducted on a High Performance Computing (HPC) platform using MapReduce, which exhibits the trend of big data analytics. The results suggest that daily-life social networking data could help early detection of important patient safety issues.

AB  - The problem of Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs) detection is a key issue in the pharmacovigilance community. Although many related researches have been proposed in recent years, majority of them were concerned about the accuracy of the detected adverse drug reactions, very few paying attention to the performance issue of how to quickly accomplish the detection process. In this work, we propose the concept of multivalued-dimension contingency cube (MDC-cube) to facilitate multidimensional, fast and online detection of ADRs, especially those caused by drug interactions. Experiments conducted on the FDA AERS data set show that our MDC-cube based method is an order of magnitude faster than the state-of-the-art ABCM-MS method.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) is a style of traditional medicine informed by modern medicine but built on a foundation of more than 2500 years of Chinese medical practice. According to statistics, TCM accounts for approximately 14% of total adverse drug reaction (ADR) spontaneous reporting data in China. Because of the complexity of the components in TCM formula, which makes it essentially different from Western medicine, it is critical to determine whether ADR reports of TCM should be analyzed independently. METHODS: Reports in the Chinese spontaneous reporting database between 2010 and 2011 were selected. The dataset was processed and divided into the total sample (all data) and the subsample (including TCM data only). Four different ADR signal detection methods-PRR, ROR, MHRA and IC- currently widely used in China, were applied for signal detection on the two samples. By comparison of experimental results, three of them-PRR, MHRA and IC-were chosen to do the experiment. We designed several indicators for performance evaluation such as R (recall ratio), P (precision ratio), and D (discrepancy ratio) based on the reference database and then constructed a decision tree for data classification based on such indicators. RESULTS: For PRR: R(1)-R(2) = 0.72%, P(1)-P(2) = 0.16% and D = 0.92%; For MHRA: R(1)-R(2) = 0.97%, P(1)-P(2) = 0.20% and D = 1.18%; For IC: R(1)-R(2) = 1.44%, P(2)-P(1) = 4.06% and D = 4.72%. The threshold of R,Pand Dis set as 2%, 2% and 3% respectively. Based on the decision tree, the results are "separation" for PRR, MHRA and IC. CONCLUSIONS: In order to improve the efficiency and accuracy of signal detection, we suggest that TCM data should be separated from the total sample when conducting analyses.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Regulations are increasing the scope of activities that fall under the remit of drug safety. Currently, individual case safety report (ICSR) collection and collation is done manually, requiring pharmacovigilance professionals to perform many transactional activities before data are available for assessment and aggregated analyses. For a biopharmaceutical company to meet its responsibilities to patients and regulatory bodies regarding the safe use and distribution of its products, improved business processes must be implemented to drive the industry forward in the best interest of patients globally. Augmented intelligent capabilities have already demonstrated success in capturing adverse events from diverse data sources. It has potential to provide a scalable solution for handling the ever-increasing ICSR volumes experienced within the industry by supporting pharmacovigilance professionals' decision-making. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to train and evaluate a consortium of cognitive services to identify key characteristics of spontaneous ICSRs satisfying an acceptable level of accuracy determined by considering business requirements and effective use in a real-world setting. The results of this study will serve as supporting evidence for or against implementing augmented intelligence in case processing to increase operational efficiency and data quality consistency. METHODS: A consortium of ten cognitive services to augment aspects of ICSR processing were identified and trained through deep-learning approaches. The input data for model training were 20,000 ICSRs received by Celgene drug safety over a 2-year period. The data were manually made machine-readable through the process of transcription, which converts images into text. The machine-readable documents were manually annotated for pharmacovigilance data elements to facilitate the training and testing of the cognitive services. Once trained by cognitive developers, the cognitive services' output was reviewed by pharmacovigilance subject-matter experts against the accepted ground-truth for correctness and completeness. To be considered adequately trained and functional, each cognitive service was required to reach a threshold of F(1) or accuracy score ≥ 75%. RESULTS: All ten cognitive services under development have reached an evaluative score ≥ 75% for spontaneous ICSRs. CONCLUSION: All cognitive services under development have achieved the minimum evaluative threshold to be considered adequately trained, demonstrating how machine-learning and natural language processing techniques together provide accurate outputs that may augment pharmacovigilance professionals' processing of spontaneous ICSRs quickly and accurately. The intention of augmented intelligence is not to replace the pharmacovigilance professional, but rather support them in their consistent decision-making so that they may better handle the overwhelming amount of data otherwise manually curated and monitored for ongoing drug surveillance requirements. Through this supported decision-making, pharmacovigilance professionals may have more time to apply their knowledge in assessing the case rather than spending it performing transactional tasks to simply capture the pertinent data within a safety database. By capturing data consistently and efficiently, we begin to build a corpus of data upon which analyses may be conducted and insights gleaned. Cognitive services may be key to an organization's transformation to more proactive decision-making needed to meet regulatory requirements and enhance patient safety.

AB  - Aim: The aim of this article is to investigate the vascular safety profile of triptans through an analysis of the United States Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FDA-AERS) database with a special focus on serious and unexpected adverse events. Methods: A case/non-case analysis was performed on the reports entered in the FDA-AERS from 2004 to 2010: Cases were reports with at least one event included in the MedDRA system organ classes 'Cardiac disorder' or 'Vascular disorders', whereas non-cases were all the remaining reports. Co-reported cardiovascular drugs were used as a proxy of cardiovascular risk and the adjusted reporting odds ratio (adj.ROR) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) was calculated. Disproportionality signals were defined as adj.ROR value >1. Adverse events were considered unexpected if not mentioned on the relevant label. Results: Among 2,131,688 reports, 7808 concerned triptans. Cases were 2593 among triptans and 665,940 for all other drugs. Unexpected disproportionality signals were found in the following high-level terms of the MedDRA hierarchy: 'Cerebrovascular and spinal necrosis and vascular insufficiency' (103 triptan cases), 'Aneurysms and dissections non-site specific' (15), 'Pregnancy-associated hypertension' (10), 'Reproductive system necrosis and vascular insufficiency' (3). Discussion: Our analysis revealed three main groups of unexpected associations between triptans and serious vascular events: ischaemic cerebrovascular events, aneurysms and artery dissections, and pregnancy-related vascular events. A case-by-case assessment is needed to confirm or disprove their plausibility and large-scale analytical studies should be planned for risk rate estimation. In the meantime, clinicians should pay special attention to migraine diagnosis and vascular risk assessment before prescribing a triptan, also promptly reporting any unexpected event to pharmacovigilance systems. © International Headache Society 2013.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Work on pharmacovigilance systems using texts from PubMed and Twitter typically target at different elements and use different annotation guidelines resulting in a scenario where there is no comparable set of documents from both Twitter and PubMed annotated in the same manner. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to provide a comparable corpus of texts from PubMed and Twitter that can be used to study drug reports from these two sources of information, allowing researchers in the area of pharmacovigilance using natural language processing (NLP) to perform experiments to better understand the similarities and differences between drug reports in Twitter and PubMed. METHODS: We produced a corpus comprising 1000 tweets and 1000 PubMed sentences selected using the same strategy and annotated at entity level by the same experts (pharmacists) using the same set of guidelines. RESULTS: The resulting corpus, annotated by two pharmacists, comprises semantically correct annotations for a set of drugs, diseases, and symptoms. This corpus contains the annotations for 3144 entities, 2749 relations, and 5003 attributes. CONCLUSIONS: We present a corpus that is unique in its characteristics as this is the first corpus for pharmacovigilance curated from Twitter messages and PubMed sentences using the same data selection and annotation strategies. We believe this corpus will be of particular interest for researchers willing to compare results from pharmacovigilance systems (eg, classifiers and named entity recognition systems) when using data from Twitter and from PubMed. We hope that given the comprehensive set of drug names and the annotated entities and relations, this corpus becomes a standard resource to compare results from different pharmacovigilance studies in the area of NLP.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Methylphenidate, a stimulant used to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, has the potential to be used nonmedically, such as for studying and recreation. In an era when many people actively use social networking services, experience with the nonmedical use or side effects of methylphenidate might be shared on Twitter. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to analyze tweets about the nonmedical use and side effects of methylphenidate using a machine learning approach. METHODS: A total of 34,293 tweets mentioning methylphenidate from August 2018 to July 2019 were collected using searches for "methylphenidate" and its brand names. Tweets in a randomly selected training dataset (6860/34,293, 20.00%) were annotated as positive or negative for two dependent variables: nonmedical use and side effects. Features such as personal noun, nonmedical use terms, medical use terms, side effect terms, sentiment scores, and the presence of a URL were generated for supervised learning. Using the labeled training dataset and features, support vector machine (SVM) classifiers were built and the performance was evaluated using F(1) scores. The classifiers were applied to the test dataset to determine the number of tweets about nonmedical use and side effects. RESULTS: Of the 6860 tweets in the training dataset, 5.19% (356/6860) and 5.52% (379/6860) were about nonmedical use and side effects, respectively. Performance of SVM classifiers for nonmedical use and side effects, expressed as F(1) scores, were 0.547 (precision: 0.926, recall: 0.388, and accuracy: 0.967) and 0.733 (precision: 0.920, recall: 0.609, and accuracy: 0.976), respectively. In the test dataset, the SVM classifiers identified 361 tweets (1.32%) about nonmedical use and 519 tweets (1.89%) about side effects. The proportion of tweets about nonmedical use was highest in May 2019 (46/2624, 1.75%) and December 2018 (36/2041, 1.76%). CONCLUSIONS: The SVM classifiers that were built in this study were highly precise and accurate and will help to automatically identify the nonmedical use and side effects of methylphenidate using Twitter.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Drug safety research asks causal questions but relies on observational data. Confounding bias threatens the reliability of studies using such data. The successful control of confounding requires knowledge of variables called confounders affecting both the exposure and outcome of interest. However, causal knowledge of dynamic biological systems is complex and challenging. Fortunately, computable knowledge mined from the literature may hold clues about confounders. In this paper, we tested the hypothesis that incorporating literature-derived confounders can improve causal inference from observational data. METHODS: We introduce two methods (semantic vector-based and string-based confounder search) that query literature-derived information for confounder candidates to control, using SemMedDB, a database of computable knowledge mined from the biomedical literature. These methods search SemMedDB for confounders by applying semantic constraint search for indications treated by the drug (exposure) and that are also known to cause the adverse event (outcome). We then include the literature-derived confounder candidates in statistical and causal models derived from free-text clinical notes. For evaluation, we use a reference dataset widely used in drug safety containing labeled pairwise relationships between drugs and adverse events and attempt to rediscover these relationships from a corpus of 2.2 M NLP-processed free-text clinical notes. We employ standard adjustment and causal inference procedures to predict and estimate causal effects by informing the models with varying numbers of literature-derived confounders and instantiating the exposure, outcome, and confounder variables in the models with dichotomous EHR-derived data. Finally, we compare the results from applying these procedures with naive measures of association (χ(2) and reporting odds ratio) and with each other. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: We found semantic vector-based search to be superior to string-based search at reducing confounding bias. However, the effect of including more rather than fewer literature-derived confounders was inconclusive. We recommend using targeted learning estimation methods that can address treatment-confounder feedback, where confounders also behave as intermediate variables, and engaging subject-matter experts to adjudicate the handling of problematic covariates.

AB  - The relationship between drug and its side effects has been delineated in two websites, namely Sider and WebMD. The aim of the present paper is to find the relationship between drug and its side effects as reported by typical users of a website called Ask a patient, and to compare these reports with the side effects in reference sites. In addition, the typical users' comments on highly-commented drugs (neurotic drugs, anti-pregnancy drugs and digestion drugs) within last decade were analyzed. The reason for such investigation is the fact that typical users' comments and their tendencies can be considered as an important factor in determining the best drugs in improving them or decreasing their risk dangerous. Typical users' comments on drugs' side effects were gathered from the website Ask a patient. Then, the data on drugs (neurotic drugs, anti-pregnancy drugs and digestion drugs) were classified according to deep learning model. At first using the model, the three issues, namely drug, its side effect and the cause of the side effect, were explained. Afterward, using topic modeling, the main topics of side effects for each group of drugs were identified. Finally, using the websites of Sider and WebMD in which the side effects of drugs are reported, the side effects of the three classes of drugs were retrieved. The goal of the present research was to analyze typical users' comments reported on the website called Ask a patient, and to compare these comments with the reports about the side effects of drugs from important sites. Our model demonstrates its ability to accurately describe and label side effects in a temporal text corpus. By taking full advantage of deep learning classifiers, the used methods in text mining is shown to be accurate and effective for discovering association between drugs and side effects. Moreover, through combining with modular classifier in addition to topic modeling, this model has the capability to immediately locate information in reference sites to recognize the side effect of new drugs. In fact, due to the unbiased nature of typical users' comments, these comments can be a reliable indicator for drug producer companies to reduce the side effects of drugs.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Prescription drugs can be associated with adverse effects (AEs) that are unrecognized despite evidence in the medical literature, as shown by rofecoxib's late recall in 2004. We assessed whether applying information mining to PubMed could reveal major drug-AE associations if articles testing whether drugs cause AEs are over-represented in the literature. DESIGN: MEDLINE citations published between 1949 and September 2009 were retrieved if they mentioned one of 38 drugs and one of 55 AEs. A statistical document classifier (using MeSH index terms) was constructed to remove irrelevant articles unlikely to test whether a drug caused an AE. The remaining relevant articles were analyzed using a disproportionality analysis that identified drug-AE associations (signals of disproportionate reporting) using step-up procedures developed to control the familywise type I error rate. MEASUREMENTS: Sensitivity and positive predictive value (PPV) for empirical drug-AE associations as judged against drug-AE associations subject to FDA warnings. RESULTS: In testing, the statistical document classifier identified relevant articles with 81% sensitivity and 87% PPV. Using data filtered by the statistical document classifier, base-case models showed 64.9% sensitivity and 42.4% PPV for detecting FDA warnings. Base-case models discovered 54% of all detected FDA warnings using literature published before warnings. For example, the rofecoxib-heart disease association was evident using literature published before 2002. Analyses incorporating literature mentioning AEs common to the drug class of interest yielded 71.4% sensitivity and 40.7% PPV. CONCLUSIONS: Results from large-scale literature retrieval and analysis (literature mining) compared favorably with and could complement current drug safety methods.

AB  - Adverse drug reactions are the fourth leading cause of death in the US. Although women take longer to metabolize medications and experience twice the risk of developing adverse reactions compared with men, these sex differences are not comprehensively understood. Real-world clinical data provide an opportunity to estimate safety effects in otherwise understudied populations, i.e., women. These data, however, are subject to confounding biases and correlated covariates. We present AwareDX, a pharmacovigilance algorithm that leverages advances in machine learning to predict sex risks. Our algorithm mitigates these biases and quantifies the differential risk of a drug causing an adverse event in either men or women. AwareDX demonstrates high precision during validation against clinical literature and pharmacogenetic mechanisms. We present a resource of 20,817 adverse drug effects posing sex-specific risks. AwareDX, and this resource, present an opportunity to minimize adverse events by tailoring drug prescription and dosage to sex.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Duplicate case reports in spontaneous adverse event reporting systems pose a challenge for medical reviewers to efficiently perform individual and aggregate safety analyses. Duplicate cases can bias data mining by generating spurious signals of disproportional reporting of product-adverse event pairs. OBJECTIVE: We have developed a probabilistic record linkage algorithm for identifying duplicate cases in the US Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) and the US Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS). METHODS: In addition to using structured field data, the algorithm incorporates the non-structured narrative text of adverse event reports by examining clinical and temporal information extracted by the Event-based Text-mining of Health Electronic Records system, a natural language processing tool. The final component of the algorithm is a novel duplicate confidence value that is calculated by a rule-based empirical approach that looks for similarities in a number of criteria between two case reports. RESULTS: For VAERS, the algorithm identified 77% of known duplicate pairs with a precision (or positive predictive value) of 95%. For FAERS, it identified 13% of known duplicate pairs with a precision of 100%. The textual information did not improve the algorithm's automated classification for VAERS or FAERS. The empirical duplicate confidence value increased performance on both VAERS and FAERS, mainly by reducing the occurrence of false-positives. CONCLUSIONS: The algorithm was shown to be effective at identifying pre-linked duplicate VAERS reports. The narrative text was not shown to be a key component in the automated detection evaluation; however, it is essential for supporting the semi-automated approach that is likely to be deployed at the Food and Drug Administration, where medical reviewers will perform some manual review of the most highly ranked reports identified by the algorithm.

AB  - Background and objectives: Multiple myeloma treatment with lenalidomide-based regimens is associated with risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE), particularly during concomitant use with erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs). The risk of VTE in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) patients treated with lenalidomide is not well characterized and the background risk in untreated patients is not known. This study set out to determine the reporting rate of VTE in MDS patients on lenalidomide in the two years of postmarketing experience in the US, and to investigate whether there is a disproportional signal of VTE in MDS patients on lenalidomide by screening the US FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (AERS) safety database. Methods: The MDS population exposed to lenalidomide was obtained from RevAssist®, the company's proprietary restrictive distribution programme. VTE reports were identified from the company's postmarketing surveillance safety database. The FDA AERS database was used for disproportionality analysis, and signal scores computed using three algorithms: multi-item gamma Poisson shrinker (MGPS), proportional reporting ratio (PRR), and reporting odds ratios (ROR). Results: A total of 7764 MDS patients were prescribed lenalidomide during the first two years of commercial use in the US. VTE representing deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism was reported in 41 patients, a reporting rate of 0.53%. The computed signal scores did not exceed the statistical threshold for identification of a significant disproportional signal for VTE in MDS reports involving use of lenalidomide without concomitant use of ESAs. However, a disproportional signal of VTE was detected in MDS reports where lenalidomide was concurrently used with ESAs. Conclusions: The VTE reporting rate for MDS patients receiving lenalidomide during the first two years of postmarketing exposure was low (0.53%). Disproportionality analysis demonstrated a statistically meaningful association of VTE with lenalidomide concomitantly used with ESAs in MDS patients, but the association was not statistically significant when lenalidomide was used in the absence of ESAs. © 2009 Adis Data Information BV.

AB  - As social media are an interesting source of information for pharmacovigilance, we implemented a novel visualisation method for pharmacovigilance specialists applied to French discussion forums. A word embedding model was trained on posts to facilitate the identification of patterns associated with adverse drug reactions.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To establish a web-based quantitative signal detection system for adverse drug reactions (ADRs) based on spontaneous reporting to the Guangdong province drug-monitoring database in China. METHODS: Using Microsoft Visual Basic and Active Server Pages programming languages and SQL Server 2000, a web-based system with three software modules was programmed to perform data preparation and association detection, and to generate reports. Information component (IC), the internationally recognized measure of disproportionality for quantitative signal detection, was integrated into the system, and its capacity for signal detection was tested with ADR reports collected from 1 January 2002 to 30 June 2007 in Guangdong. RESULTS: A total of 2,496 associations including known signals were mined from the test database. Signals (e.g., cefradine-induced hematuria) were found early by using the IC analysis. In addition, 291 drug-ADR associations were alerted for the first time in the second quarter of 2007. CONCLUSIONS: The system can be used for the detection of significant associations from the Guangdong drug-monitoring database and could be an extremely useful adjunct to the expert assessment of very large numbers of spontaneously reported ADRs for the first time in China.
