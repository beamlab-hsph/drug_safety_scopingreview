Severe hepatic adverse drug reactions have been occasionally reported in the literature for the selective serotonin
reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), venlafaxine and nefazodone. In
addition, a few case reports have suggested a possible
association between SSRI treatment and pancreatitis. To
further investigate this issue, a Bayesian confidence
propagation neural network (BCPNN) method was applied
on the World Health Organization database of adverse drug
reactions. This method identifies whether a drug/adverse
drug reaction combination is reported more frequently to
the database than expected on the basis of chance alone
compared to general reporting in the database. A statistically significant unexpected high number of reports were
found for nefazodone and hepatic injury, relative to the
generality of the dataset but, for the other drug/adverse
drug reaction combinations, no such association was
found. The nefazodone finding is in accordance with data
from other publications, suggesting that the risk of hepatic
injury is increased. However, because of the nature of the
BCPNN, the negative findings do not necessarily prove that
there is no excess risk for hepatic injury/pancreatitis

Introduction
Severe hepatic adverse drug reactions have been occasionally reported in the literature for the selective
serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), as well as for the
non-selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, nefazodone
and venlafaxine. For fluoxetine, one study (Capellà et al.,
1999) presents a total of six cases with hepatitis. In
addition, some single cases of assumed fluoxetineinduced hepatitis have been published (Márs et al.,
1991; Bobichon et al., 1993; Castiella and Arenas, 1994;
Friedenberg and Rothstein, 1996; Johnston and Wheeler,
1997; Cai et al., 1999). Also for sertraline (Hautekeete
et al., 1998; Kim et al., 1999; Verrico et al., 2000; FartouxHeymann et al., 2001), paroxetine (Helmchen et al., 1996;
de Man, 1997; Benbow and Gill, 1997; Cadranel et al.,
1999; Odeh et al., 2001; Azaz-Lisvits et al., 2002),
fluvoxamine (Lam et al., 1988; Green, 1998; Bamrah
et al., 1990) and venlafaxine (Horsmans et al., 1999;
Cardona et al., 2000), possible hepatotoxic reactions,
including hepatitis, have been described. Most case
reports exist for nefazodone (Aranda-Michel et al., 1999;
Lucena et al., 1999; Schrader and Roberts-Thompson,

during treatment with drugs other than nefazodone.

van Battum et al., 2000). To the regulatory authorities in
Sweden (Mortimer and Yue, 2000) and Spain (Garcı́aPando et al., 2002), severe liver affection has been
reported more frequently for nefazodone than for the
other serotonin reuptake inhibitors and, in the USA, the
Food and Drug Administration recently warned about the
risk of hepatotoxicity during treatment with nefazodone
(Food and Drug Administration, 2002).
Two cases of acute pancreatitis have been reported during
treatment with sertraline (Kvande and Madsen, 2000).
We have not been able to locate published case reports of
acute pancreatitis attributed to other serotonin reuptake
inhibitors but, according to information provided by the
manufacturers, acute pancreatitis is a rare event associated with drugs in this group, such as fluoxetine,
citalopram, paroxetine, sertraline and venlafaxine (Anonymous, 2002). Additionally, a World Health Organization
(WHO) signal was reported on fluoxetine and pancreatitis
in 1993 (Uppsala Monitoring Centre, personal communication.)

Compared with the frequency of use of serotonin
reuptake inhibitors, the number of reports in the
literature of severe liver affection and pancreatitis
appears to be generally low. Because reactions most likely
are infrequent, the true frequencies, and in many cases
whether there is an excess risk at all, are matters which
are complicated to study. The traditional methodological
approach applied in such cases is the case–control study.
However, this methodology has some drawbacks because
studies are subject to bias and confounding, and causality
cannot be proven (Collet et al., 1994).
The Bayesian confidence propagation neural network
(BCPNN) method has been developed as a procedure to
highlight potential new signals for clinical review in the
WHO database of adverse drug reactions (Bate et al.,
1998; Lindquist et al., 1999; Orre et al., 2000). This
database is the world’s largest database of spontaneously
reported case of suspected adverse drug reactions,
containing nearly three million reports. The present
study applied the BCPNN method to this database to
investigate whether there are higher numbers of reports
on hepatic injury and pancreatitis during treatment with
serotonin reuptake inhibitors, than would be expected on
the basis of chance alone, compared to general reporting
in this database.

Methods
The WHO database of adverse drug reactions is held by
the Uppsala Monitoring Centre on behalf of 68 countries
participating in the WHO Program on International Drug
Monitoring. One of the primary goals of the database is
the early detection on new safety signals (Bate et al.,
1998; Lindquist et al., 1999; Orre et al., 2000).
The adverse drug reaction terms in the database that
were included in the present study were hepatitis,
hepatic necrosis, hepatic failure and pancreatitis. These
terms were chosen because they represent the most
severe diagnoses of affection of the liver and pancreas,
and are diagnoses for which morphological alterations
exist. To increase the number of cases included and
reduce the risks of mass significance, the three hepatic
diagnoses were put together in a new group, designated
hepatic injury. Less severe and solely biochemical hepatic
adverse reaction terms, such as increased plasma levels of
various liver enzymes, were thus excluded from the study.
The adverse drug reaction terms included were studied
for each of the SSRIs (citalopram, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine and sertraline), as well as for the nonselective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, nefazodone and
venlafaxine.
The BCPNN technique has been described in detail
elsewhere (Bate et al., 1998; Lindquist et al., 1999; Orre
et al., 2000). In short, in the database, all adverse reactions

reports contain at least one drug (x variable) and one
suspected adverse reaction (y variable). The BCPNN
methodology uses a neural network computational
architecture to search for unexpectedly strong dependencies between variables within the dataset, most often
drugs and adverse drug reactions. The dependencies are
selected using a measure of disproportionality called the
Information Component (IC), the calculation of which is
made using Bayesian statistical methods. Consequently,
an IC value can be calculated for a specific drug–adverse
drug reaction combination. The IC value is based on the
number of case reports with a particular drug x (Cx), and
the number of case reports with a particular adverse
reaction (Cy), the number of reports with the specific
drug adverse drug reaction combination xy (Cxy), and the
total number of reports (C). Calculation of the standard
deviation of the IC value provides a measure of the
robustness of the value. The higher the Cx, Cy, and Cxy
values are, the narrower becomes the confidence interval.
If the lower two-sided 95% confidence interval of the IC
(the IC–2 SD value) is above zero, this provides strong
support that the combination is reported unexpectedly
frequently relative to general reporting of the drug and
adverse drug reactions. Such combinations are routinely
highlighted for clinical review. Because of the tentative
nature of the dataset, the method is used for hypothesis
generation rather than for testing.
The analysis was performed on the data in the WHO
database at the end of the second quarter of 2002, when
there were 2830 764 reports in total.

Results
The total number of reports of hepatic injury in the
database was 27 542. Of these, 786 were reported for the
serotonin reuptake inhibitors. The number of reports for
each drug as well as the IC and IC ± 2 SD values are
presented in Table 1. The IC value with its entire
confidence interval was above zero for nefazodone,
indicating a statistically significant unexpected number
of reports relative to the background of reporting in the
database. For the other drugs, no such relationships were
found.
The total number of reports of pancreatitis in the
database was 9255. Of these, 305 were reported for the
serotonin reuptake inhibitors. The number of reports for
each drug as well as the IC and IC ± 2 SD values is
presented in Table 2. For pancreatitis, no drugs had IC
values with their entire confidence intervals above zero.

Discussion
The reliability of data in the WHO database is dependent
on the quality of the national systems of spontaneous
reporting of adverse drug reactions in the participating
countries. It is well known that spontaneous adverse drug

reaction reporting in general is limited by factors such as
under-reporting and provision of incomplete information
(ten Ham, 1992). In addition, reporting differs between
countries, influenced by several factors such as the extent
of use of the drugs, the year of introduction to the
market, general knowledge of the adverse effects of the
drug, public attention to specific problems, and health
professionals’ attitudes to reporting of adverse drug
reactions. Despite these limitations, spontaneous adverse
drug reaction reporting represents an important and costeffective way of detecting infrequent reactions (Edwards
et al., 1996). However, the method cannot be used to
establish a conclusive causal relationship between a
symptom or a clinical finding and a drug because it is
not possible to definitely rule out other causes in every
single case.

vigilance system, the estimated incidence of hepatotoxicity associated with nefazodone was 29 cases per 100 000
patient years compared to 1.3–2.6 for the other serotonin
reuptake inhibitors (Garcı́a-Pando et al., 2002). Moreover,
in the USA, a ‘black box’ warning has recently been added
to the product information on nefazodone (Food and
Drug Administration, 2002). This warning states that,
based upon postmarketing experience, the reported rate
of liver failure during treatment with nefazodone has
been estimated to be one case per 200 000–300 000
patient years, which is three- to four-fold higher than the
expected background rate in a corresponding population.
Thus, the finding in the present study is in accordance
with other recently published data, suggesting that
nefazodone is associated with an increased risk for severe
hepatic injury.

Applied to the WHO database, the BCPNN method
further increases the value of spontaneous reporting by
facilitating early detection of adverse drug reactions and
by providing a statistical measure of the likelihood and
size of an association, highlighting the association for
evaluation of its clinical plausibility (Bate et al., 1998). We
found one statistically significant unexpectedly frequently reported drug–adverse drug reaction combination, nefazodone and hepatic injury. This result is in
accordance with the findings in other studies published
during the preparation of this article. Based upon
spontaneous reports collected by the Spanish pharmaco-

For the other drug–adverse drug reaction combinations
studied, no positive associations were revealed. Given the
methodology used, the most important question is
whether this finding is due to the fact that there is no
excess risk, or whether there could be an excess risk that
could not be detected by the BCPNN method. The
negative results are not due to small numbers of reports,
as the BCPNN methodology is developed specifically to
focus on highlighting combinations with unexpectedly
high but overall small number of cases. As expected, the
confidence limits of the IC are relatively narrow. The
large general reporting of the adverse reactions under

study and the large overall reporting of SSRIs mean that
large numbers of suspected reports of the related
combinations would be required to make the combinations stand out unexpectedly frequently (i.e. to make the
IC–2 SD positive). For hepatic injury, more than 27 000
reports exist in total in the database and almost 800 of
these are reported for the serotonin reuptake inhibitors.
For pancreatitis, the corresponding numbers are more
than 9000 and approximately 300, respectively. When
all adverse drug reaction diagnoses are taken together,
more than 120 000 reports exist for the serotonin
reuptake inhibitors. Therefore, e.g. for fluoxetine, more
than 10% of the next 700 reports would have to be of
pancreatitis in order to increase the IC–2 SD value above
zero.
The BCPNN method is primarily developed to detect
early positive signals, but it has been shown that it also
can be used to avoid false positive suspicions that might
be generated based upon single case reports (Bate et al.,
1998). However, the method is by nature asymmetric (i.e.
whereas an IC–2 SD value above zero well suggest a
positive association between the drug and the reported
event, the converse is not as strong). A retrospective
evaluation of the BCPNN showed that 85% of the
combinations that did not stand out were either
previously known, or were not listed 10 years later in
the literature, and thus were considered non-signals
(Lindquist et al., 2000). However, this finding was based
upon a small sample of combinations.
Another possible explanation for true relationships not
being detected, if they exist, is related to the inherent
weaknesses in spontaneous reporting. It is possible that
there is selective under-reporting or misclassification on
these specific adverse drug reactions for this drug group.
Moreover, other frequently reported adverse drug reactions for the SSRIs might reduce the probability of
detecting clinically significant, but infrequently reported
adverse drug reactions on these drugs. Another possible
explanation is that the reactions occur so infrequently
that they are not discovered by means of the BCPNN
method. In fact, a negative IC value does not mean that
no such adverse drug reactions exist, but rather that there
is no excess reporting compared to reporting for an
average drug and an average adverse drug reaction in the
database. Therefore, our results only show that liver
injury and pancreatitis, with the exception of nefazodone–liver injury, is not reported more commonly with
the serotonin reuptake inhibitors compared to an average
drug and average adverse drug reaction.
A retrospective case-by-case evaluation of spontaneous
reports from which a signal was derived will generally
increase the strength of evidence for or against the signal.
However, for the adverse drug reactions investigated in

this study, there are numerous other potential causes,
such as alcohol-related diseases, infections, autoimmune
disorders, tumours, biliary diseases and exposition to
environmental toxins. Because the reports in the WHO
database contain a limited amount of data, the value of
performing a case-by-case evaluation was considered to
be low in this particular study. A pilot study of some of
the reports from Sweden (one of the countries with the
most complete reporting information) revealed that, even
in these reports, it was extremely difficult to fully
exclude other causes than drug treatment.
Based upon the recently published report from the
Spanish pharmacovigilance system (Garcı́a-Pando et al.,
2002), the reporting rate of hepatic injury of serotonin
reuptake inhibitors other than nefazodone was 1.2–3.6
per 100 000 patient years. Although these numbers are
most likely lower than the true incidence rates as a result
of under-reporting, the study provided no evidence that
these figures were higher than the expected background
rate. In a recent case–control study on drug-induced
pancreatitis, use of antidepressants was found to have an
odds ratio of 2.1 with a 95% confidence interval of 1.2–3.7
(Blomgren et al., 2002). However, in this study, tricyclic
antidepressants and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors were studied as a group, and cigarette smoking and
consumption of alcohol, which could be expected to be
higher in subjects taking antidepressants compared to the
general population, might act as confounding factors.
Thus, it remains an open question as to whether the use
of serotonin reuptake inhibitors is associated with an
increased risk for pancreatitis.
In conclusion, the present study demonstrates a statistically unexpected excess reporting of hepatic injury
during treatment with nefazodone relative to the
generality of reporting in the WHO database. This result
is in accordance with other studies, and strengthens the
reliability of the BCPNN as a signal detection tool. None
of the other serotonin reuptake inhibitors were highlighted with hepatic injury, and none of the drugs studied
were associated with pancreatitis. However, because of
the methodology used, a negative finding does not
necessarily prove that there is no excess risk for liver
injury or pancreatitis during treatment with these drugs.
Thus, further studies using alternative methodologies are
required to demonstrate whether the selective serotonin
reuptake inhibitors or venlafaxine may cause hepatic
injury or pancreatitis.
