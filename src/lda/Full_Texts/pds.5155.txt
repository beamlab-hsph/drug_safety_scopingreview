ated with hydroxychloroquine as the primary suspect drug between January
1, 2004, and December 31, 2019, for older adults (≥65 years). Adverse events
are preferred terms (PTs) defined in MedDRA. We used frequentist approaches,
including the reporting odds ratio (ROR) and the proportional reporting ratio
(PRR) to measure disproportionality. We used Bayesian approaches to derive
information component (IC) value and Empirical Bayesian Geometric Mean
(EBGM) score. Signals were defined as the number of reports > 3 and the lower
limit of 95% confidence intervals (CI) of ROR ≥ 2, PRR ≥ 2, IC > 0, EBGM > 1.
Results: We identified 334 adverse cardiac events comprising 71 different MedDRA
PTs from 2004 to 2019 for hydroxychloroquine in older adults. Strong disproportionality signals were noted for “Restrictive cardiomyopathy” (ROR = 272.43

(78.65–653.80); 93.82 (32.19–219.81), “Myocardial fibrosis” (57.29 (21.06–155.85);
42.99 (14.74–100.75), and “Cardiotoxicity” (43.90 (26.66–72.27); 40.28 (24.02–63.72).
Conclusions: The risk of cardiomyopathy and myocardial disorders is high following
exposure to hydroxychloroquine in older adults. Due to the current lack of safety
data from randomized controlled trials as well as large observational studies to confirm the risk of adverse cardiac events associated with hydroxychloroquine, findings
from analyses of post-marketing data may serve as interim guidance.
