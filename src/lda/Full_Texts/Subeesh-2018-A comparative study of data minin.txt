ABSTRACT
Objective: Signal detection is a technique in pharmacovigilance for the
early detection of new, rare reactions (desired or undesired) of a drug. This
study aims to compare and appraise the performance of data mining
algorithms used in signal detection. Method: Most commonly used three
data mining algorithms (DMAs) (Reporting Odds Ratio (ROR), Proportional
Reporting Ratio (PRR) and Information Component (IC)) were selected and
applied retrospectively in USFDA Adverse Event Reporting System database
to detect five confirmed Drug Event Combinations. They were selected in
such a way that the drug is withdrawn from the market or label change
between 2006-2015. A value of ROR-1.96SE>1, PRR≥2, χ2>4 or IC- 2SD>0
were considered as the positive signal. The data mining algorithms were
compared for their sensitivity and early detection. Result: Among the three
data mining algorithms, Information Component was found to have a
maximum sensitivity (100%) followed by Reporting Odds Ratio (60%) and
Proportional Reporting Ratio (40%). Sensitivity associated with the number
of reports per drug event combination and early signal detection suggested
that information component needs comparatively fewer reports to show
positive signal than the other two data mining algorithms. ROR and PRR

showed comparable results. Conclusion: Early detection of a reaction is
possible using signal detection technique. Information component was
found to be sensitive method compared with other two data mining
algorithms in FDA Adverse Event Reporting System database. As the number
of reports of drug event combination increased, the sensitivity and comparability of data mining algorithm also increased.

INTRODUCTION
The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has maintained the
Adverse Events Reporting System (AERS) database since 1968 with the
intention of continuous monitoring of drugs during the post-marketing
surveillance.1 AERS database is a collection of suspected Adverse Event
(AEs) reports from pharmaceutical companies, consumers and healthcare professionals.2 To date, FDA AERS database contains more than
10 million AE reports and receive nearly half a million each year. Many
approaches have been adopted into post-marketing studies, including
prescription-event monitoring (PEM), spontaneous reporting, case
review, observational study and drug utilization review.

DMAs such as the PRR of the Netherlands, the ROR of the United Kingdom
and the IC of the WHO are widely used.9-10
Speaking of the DMAs, one of the frequently discussed and yet to be
resolved question is which algorithm has superior performance. The
absence of gold standard,11 enormous ADR reports, different coding
systems, a wide range of data mining processes and structural dissimilarities of databases made the comparisons across the DMAs difficult.
Limited studies have been conducted to compare the DMAs thus far.
This study aims to compare and appraise the performance of signal
detection techniques used in data mining.

Compared to clinical trials and traditional epidemiologic studies, the
computer-assisted Data Mining Algorithms (DMAs) are relatively new
and characterized by providing a fast and efficient way of detecting
possible Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs) signal.3 Several DMAs have
been well described in the literature, mainly including the Reporting
Odds Ratio (ROR),4 Multi-item Gamma Poisson Shrinker (MGPS),5 the
Proportional Reporting Ratio (PRR),6 and the Information Component
(IC).7 By integrating such computer-aided techniques, incorporating
statistical analyses and centralizing different data resources, it is not only
possible to minimize the human efforts and errors but also assist the
regulatory bodies and safety councils.8

METHODOLOGY
Most commonly used three DMAs (ROR, PRR and IC) were selected
based on a literature survey. DMAs were applied retrospectively (Table 1
and 2) in US FDA AERS database to detect five confirmed Drug Event
Combinations (DEC) (Table 3). The DEC was selected in regard to the
withdrawal of the drug from the market between 2006-2015 or the
change in labelling criteria or black box warning of the drug during the
time period of 2006-2015. The time period is important because the data
available in USFDA AERS database for signal detection is from 2006.

A.M. Wilson9 defined ‘data mining’ as ‘the use of statistical techniques,
such as disproportionality measures for database or large information
sources for extracting an unknown information’. At present, three major

AE reports from the FDA AERS database were used for the study. It is a
surveillance program used for detecting serious AEs that have not been
identified during premarketing analysis.12

Study Procedure
FDA AERS database downloaded from USFDA official website. The
database converted into excel from text format for the ease of analysis and computation. Primary suspects and secondary suspect
case IDs of the drug of interest were noted from DRUG file. AE pertaining
to those case IDs were filtered and listed. Different parameters of the
DMA equation (Table 1) were computed and finally applied to the equation
(Table 2).

Statistical analysis
The threshold was predefined as PRR of ≥2.0 with a Chi-squared test
of ≥4.0, at least three reports (n ≥3) of that preferred term(PT), IC with
IC-2SD>0 and ROR with ROR-1.96SE>1. The confidence interval (95%)
were considered to be statistically significant.13
Journal of Young Pharmacists, Vol 10, Issue 4, Oct-Dec, 2018

ROR, PRR and IC were applied on USFDA AERS database to detect five
confirmed DEC and to compare the DMAs.

Propoxyphene
Propoxyphene was approved in 1957 and was withdrawn
from the market in 2010 owing to serious cardiac toxicity. A total of
366 DEC were reported from 2005Q1 to 2010Q4 in USFDA AERS
database (Table 4). ROR, 1.43 (95% CI, 1.26-1.52) and PRR, 2.8 (95% CI,
2.24- 3.32) showed positive signal from 2009Q1 and IC, 0.62 (95% CI,
0.06 -1.02) showed positive signal from 2007Q1 for the selected DEC.
PTs used for data mining were “cardiac arrest” and “cardio-respiratory
arrest”. Positive signals were highlighted with bold letters.

Sibutramine
Sibutramine was approved in 1997 as an oral anorexiant. Later in
2010, it was withdrawn from the market due to severe cardio and
cerebrovascular accidents and associated death. A total of 4182 DEC
were reported from 2005Q1 to 2010Q4 in USFDA AERS database
(Table 4). Only IC, 0.28 (95% CI, 0.05 – 0.54) showed a positive signal
for sibutramine from 2009Q1 whereas ROR and PRR failed to show a
positive signal for the given DEC in the specified duration. PT used for
data mining were “cerebrovascular disease” and “stroke”. Positive signals
were highlighted with bold letters.

Rosiglitazone
Rosiglitazone was approved in 1999 for diabetes mellitus and was withdrawn from the market because of cardiac toxicity and associated death
in 2010. A total of 11839 DEC were reported from 2005Q1 to 2010Q4
in USFDA AERS database (Table 4). ROR, 1.4 (95% CI, 1-1.8) showed
positive signal from 2009Q3, PRR, 2.7 (95% CI, 2.1-3.6) from 2009Q4
and IC, 0.24 (95% CI, 0.02 - 0.5) showed positive signal from 2008Q3
for the given DEC in the specified period. PT used for data mining were
“Myocardial Infarction” (MI). Positive signals were highlighted with
bold letters.

Sitagliptin
Sitagliptin was approved in 2006 for diabetes mellitus. Recently (2012),
the labelling criteria of sitagliptin had changed to include a black box
warning of renal failure associated with sitagliptin. A total of 854 DEC
were reported from 2005Q1 to 2015Q2 in USFDA AERS database (Table
5). Only IC, 0.1 (95% CI, 0 – 0.23) showed positive signal (from 2011Q2)
whereas ROR and PRR failed to show positive signal. PT used for data
mining were “renal failure acute”, “creatinine renal clearance decreased”
and “blood creatinine increases”. Positive signals were highlighted with
bold letters.

Canagliflozin
Canagliflozin is approved in 2013 for the treatment of Diabetes Mellitus and in 2015 it was subjected to a change in labelling criteria to
incorporate safety warning of Urinary Tract Infection (UTI). A total of 566 DEC were reported from 2013Q2 to 2015Q4 in USFDA
AERS database (Table 5). IC, 0.78 (95% CI, 0.53- 0.98) and ROR, 1.42
(95% CI, 1.11-1.94) showed a positive signal at 2015Q3 and 2015Q4
respectively. PT used for data mining were “urinary tract infection”.
Positive signals were highlighted with bold letters.
Sensitivity of DMAs
The sensitivity of three DMAs were assessed (Table 6) in accordance with
its potential to identify the signals prior to the withdrawal date. Out of

five, IC showed maximum sensitivity (100%) followed by ROR (60%)
and PRR (40%).

tively fewer reports to show positive signal than ROR and PRR. Parallel
to the above result, ROR and PRR are almost identical in their sensitivity.

The sensitivity of DMA based on Early Detection

DISCUSSION

DMAs were assessed for their ability for early detection of a signal
(Table 7). Index Date of Withdrawn/Label change (IDW/L) were identified
from literature or official websites of USFDA. The quadrant from which
DEC started showing positive signals were allocated as Index Date of
Detection (IDD). Early detection was quantified by IDD subtracted from
IDW/L. IC was found to be the most sensitive, as it detects positive signal
well before other DMAs and there is no remarkable difference in sensitivity of early detection between ROR and PRR.
Sensitivity associated with the number of reports per DEC
DMAs were assessed for their sensitivity with respect to the number of
reports required to show positive signal (Figure 1). Sensitivity associated
with the number of reports per DEC suggested that IC need compara446

In this study, the most commonly used three DMAs are ROR, PRR and
IC which are applied retrospectively in USFDA AERS database to detect
five known and confirmed ADRs associated with the drug withdrawal
or change in labelling criteria. Further comparisons across the selected
DMAs were executed to identify the sensitivity by means of early detection
and number of reports.
Hitherto, there is no clearly defined method to compare the DMAs with
respect to their sensitivity or performance. The major drawback in
comparing the DMAs is the lack of golden standards.14 In E.P. van
Puijenbroek, A. Bate11 study, they compared the DMAs like PRR, Yule’s
Q and Chi-square with IC, which was considered as a golden standard by
them. Another study conducted by K. Kubota15 in Japanese spontaneous
reports, compared five DMAs. According to Kubota et al., the number of

Limitations of the study
There are some concerns regarding FDA AERS database. Under-reporting
is the main concern with regards to any spontaneous reporting system
(SRS) database. SRS will not reflect the actual picture of the scenario.
Thus, more often the situation was underestimated. Secondly, the reporting
may get biased when there is a change in labelling criteria or any special
updates regarding an ADR of the drug. As a result, over-reporting of
that particular ADR will occur which will decrease the signal strength
of other ADRs of the same drug (change in Ni value will affect the signal
strength).
The selection of brand names for data mining is another limitation which
we had come across. FDA AERS database is a collection of ADR reports
around the world but the main contributor is United States (US). The
brand names used for data mining in this study mainly focused on the
US, European countries and India. Thus, the chances of missing data
cannot be ruled out.

CONCLUSION
DECs identified as signals were considered as the measure of sensitivity.
Compared to the above two studies,11,15 the findings of the present study
seemed to be more reliable because the reference standard considered
is more robust. Comparison of DMAs is possible in many ways, but the
main aspect which directly influences the DMA values is the number of
reports. Thus, according to this study, a cumulative number of reports
should be considered as the measure of sensitivity. Early detection of
ADRs is the main advantage of DMAs,16-17 therefore it can be considered
as a measure of sensitivity.
This study indicates that IC is more sensitive in terms of early detection
as well as the number of reports. However, among the DMAs, the sensitivity difference is statistically not significant. Moreover, the sensitivity of
DMAs may vary if a different database is used hence, we cannot conclude
that IC is the most sensitive DMA. Nevertheless, for a given set of data
and DMAs, IC showed more sensitivity than other DMAs. It has been
observed that the sensitivity is proportional to the number of reports.
According to V.G. Koutkias and M.-C. Jaulent,18 the number of reports is
an important factor for signal strength.
According to the literature review, it was observed that no study has been
attempted to compare DMA to identify the sensitive method among the
existing algorithms. We comply with P. Waller19 study, as the selection
of DMAs should be done on the basis of their specificity, sensitivity and
predictive value in addition to a factor observed from our study. Early
detection of ADR plays a vital role which may reduce the casualties and
provide sufficient time for a regulatory decision.
It is not surprising that IDD is earlier than IDW because once the positive
signal is identified, FDA requires adequate time to evaluate the situation,
assess the risk-benefit profile of the drug and for a regulatory decision.
However, the use of DMAs could trigger the initiation of this process
earlier by recognizing signals in advance. Few studies have compared the
traditional method of ADR detection with computer-based signal detection techniques. A study conducted by A.W. I20 concluded that DMAs
detected safety signals well before the conventional ways. According to
D.J. Graham,21 there were 88,000–140,000 excess of cardiac disorders
associated with rofecoxib. It could have been reduced if the safety signal
was detected earlier.
We rely on the progression between the early detection of an ADR signal
to the final decision that drug withdrawal or labelling change could more
likely be acquired due to the earlier detection of ADR signals as a
result of the applications of DMAs. Consequently, the time when the
FDA makes a decision will correspondingly occur earlier.

The aim of the study was to compare and appraise the performance
of signal detection techniques used in data mining. It is the first study
attempted to address the importance of early detection of ADR and identification of the sensitive method. Even though there is no statistically
significant difference among three DMAs, IC was found to be sensitive
method compared with other two DMAs in FDA AERs database. The
sensitivity and comparability of DMA is proportionate to the number of
reports of DEC.
