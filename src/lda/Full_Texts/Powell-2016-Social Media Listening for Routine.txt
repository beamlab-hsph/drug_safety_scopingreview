Abstract
Introduction Post-marketing safety surveillance primarily
relies on data from spontaneous adverse event reports,
medical literature, and observational databases. Limitations
of these data sources include potential under-reporting,
lack of geographic diversity, and time lag between event
occurrence and discovery. There is growing interest in
exploring the use of social media (‘social listening’) to
supplement established approaches for pharmacovigilance.
Although social listening is commonly used for commercial purposes, there are only anecdotal reports of its use in
pharmacovigilance. Health information posted online by
patients is often publicly available, representing an untapped source of post-marketing safety data that could supplement data from existing sources.
Objectives The objective of this paper is to describe one
methodology that could help unlock the potential of social
media for safety surveillance.
Methods A third-party vendor acquired 24 months of
publicly available Facebook and Twitter data, then processed the data by standardizing drug names and vernacular symptoms, removing duplicates and noise, masking

Facebook. Further analysis revealed that 26 % of posts also
contained benefit information.
Conclusion Social media listening is an important tool to
augment post-marketing safety surveillance. Much work
remains to determine best practices for using this rapidly
evolving data source.

1 Introduction
Pharmacovigilance, or drug safety surveillance, is the science related to the collection, detection, assessment,
monitoring, and prevention of adverse effects with

444

pharmaceutical products [1]. This discipline has advanced
rapidly since the early 1960s when the world experienced
the infamous disaster of phocomelia caused by thalidomide
use during pregnancy. This discovery, along with several
other high-profile safety issues, led to the call for and
realization of a number of advances in the science of
pharmacovigilance.
Prior to approval and marketing, a drug undergoes
several stages of clinical trials to assess its safety and
efficacy within a controlled environment. However, once
the drug is marketed, the number of people exposed to it
can increase exponentially. The controlled environment of
strict inclusion and exclusion criteria does not necessarily
hold in the marketed environment. Real-world use can
expand beyond the strict interpretation of the label,
although updates to the label remain a major avenue for
communication of emerging safety concerns with healthcare providers. As a result, it is important that pharmaceutical companies and regulatory agencies have robust
post-marketing safety surveillance processes that can provide information about real-world drug use.
A key source of post-marketing data is spontaneous
adverse event (AE) reports. Regulatory agencies and
industry stakeholders worldwide have mandatory reporting
systems for certain adverse drug reactions (ADRs), medication errors, and quality problems, as well as systems for
voluntary reporting of any concerns. Although spontaneous
reports provide a valuable source of data, they have many
limitations, including, but not limited to, significant underreporting of events, incomplete data quality for clinical
evaluation, and a lack of geographic diversity in reporting
(e.g., most reports are from the USA and Europe).
In the USA, the Food and Drug Administration
Amendments Act of 2007 (FDAAA 2007) mandated the
development of new pharmacovigilance technologies
focused on observational data (e.g., medical records,
insurance claims databases) [2]. Several initiatives are
underway that further explore ways in which observational
data can be best utilized for post-marketing safety
surveillance [3–6]. Limitations of observational data
include a time delay (e.g., most publicly available data
sources have a lag time of 9–12 months), a lack of geographic diversity (e.g., most data sources are from the USA
or Europe), and insufficient information to determine the
probability that the drug was a causative factor of the
event.
One potential new source of drug safety data may be
social media. A recent survey showed that nearly 90 % of
the US adult population uses the Internet, and 72 % of
those users had searched online for information about
health issues [7]. Furthermore, between 3 and 4 % of
Internet users have posted about their experiences with
healthcare service providers or treatments on social media

G. E. Powell et al.

sites [7]. Much of the data posted by these patients are
publicly available on the Internet, depending on the individual’s use of privacy settings when posting.
Because the Internet is already being used to communicate medical information, social listening—the process of
learning from public conversations on the Internet [8]—is
worthy of further exploration for several reasons, including
those investigated by others [9–17]. First, it may unlock a
large data source that has been previously untapped for
pharmacovigilance. Second, it introduces the voice of the
patient directly into the conversation about drug safety,
using his or her own words, which may prove valuable to
our understanding of real-world medication use. Third, the
worldwide utilization of social media and rapid availability
of data may offer real-time access to geographically
diverse data without a significant temporal lag between an
event’s occurrence and its discovery by the pharmacovigilance community. These social listening attributes could
help overcome some of the limitations of other data
sources.
While public health research efforts have typically
relied on traditional data sources, social media is gaining as
a viable data source that can be used to analyze and forecast epidemiologic trends. HealthMap, developed by the
Computational Epidemiology Group at Boston Children’s
Hospital, is a publicly available online surveillance system
designed to detect infectious disease outbreaks from news
media reports. Recently, HealthMap identified the earliest
public signals of an initial Ebola outbreak in Guinea dating
back to March 2014. Within 6 months of the outbreak,
more than 13,000 alerts were aggregated, classified, and
visualized, enabling researchers to visualize a projected
spread of the disease and high-risk areas of transmission.
HealthMap’s Ebola data were used to support outbreak
surveillance by the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention, Department of Homeland Security, Department
of Health and Human Services, and the World Health
Organization (WHO) [18].
Another study, conducted by Merck and the Computational Epidemiology Group at Boston Children’s Hospital,
investigated whether Twitter data could be of use in
research on sleep issues. Using data acquired from public
Twitter posts, the authors created cohorts of patients to
characterize and compare individuals apparently experiencing sleep issues compared with those who were not. The
authors concluded that social media provided a cost-effective and efficient source of valuable data that could
contribute to research on sleep issues [19].
Overall, we hypothesize that by capturing publicly
available data on social media sites and Internet forums, we
might meaningfully and positively impact current pharmacovigilance processes. In this paper, we describe and
evaluate one applied approach to social media listening for

Social Media Listening for Routine Post-Marketing Safety Surveillance

pharmacovigilance and identify whether any benefit
information was also present.

concepts existed in the dictionary. For the purpose of this
paper, the term ‘drug’ may represent a range of pharmaceutical products (e.g., prescription medicines, over-thecounter products, vaccines, etc.).

2 Methods
2.2 Filtering
After acquisition of publicly available Facebook and
Twitter data using these sites’ public Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), which are commercially
available from authorized data resellers, the following steps
were performed by a third-party vendor:
•
•
•
•

Translation: standardization of drug names and vernacular symptom/event descriptions.
Filtering: highlighting of relevant posts and data
cleaning (removal of duplicates and noise).
De-identification: removal of personally identifying
information.
Supplementation: addition of other data sources to
assist with interpretation.

2.1 Translation
After data were collected, posts underwent an automated
classification process to interpret the wording used to
describe drug and medical condition concepts. Natural
language processing (NLP) software, which refers to the
development and use of computer systems to recognize and
interpret natural human language [20], reviewed each post
and matched the text against a vernacular-to-regulatory
language translation dictionary. At the time of our research,
the dictionary contained over 5,000 phrases linked to
approximately 1,500 Medical Dictionary for Regulatory
Activities (MedDRA) Preferred Terms (PTs). The process
of identifying PTs by tagging verbatim text was conducted
in an entirely automated fashion (e.g., ‘‘I looked like a
lobster’’ would be mapped to ‘‘erythema’’).
In addition to standardizing medical concepts, we also
standardized drug names based on the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classification system for drugs. All
individual product search terms were mapped to the fifth
level of the ATC system hierarchy, with the ability to
group product data at the substance level. If a single post
were to refer to more than one product, human curation
would be used to attribute each symptom to the appropriate
product, where verbatim descriptions made attribution
possible. WHO’s published guidelines for ATC classification and defined daily dose (DDD) assignment were followed for mapping combination products. Products with
more than one ATC code were mapped to multiple hierarchies. We used a proprietary dictionary that maps vernacular terms for drugs, including common misspellings.
At the time of our research, about 1,000 distinct drug

The next step was to identify which posts were relevant for
drug safety. To achieve this, a Bayesian probabilistic
model was developed through statistical machine learning
computation, based on Robinson’s approach to eliminating
spam emails [21], also described in detail elsewhere [20].
The dataset to train the model was developed by manually
coding more than 100,000 posts using a custom curation
interface built specifically for reviewing and labeling posts.
Curators were certified MedDRA coders and trained in
pharmacovigilance, and adhered to standard assessment
practices whereby a priori assumptions of causality did not
influence curation. Analysts labeled the posts as either a
post in which a potential AE is discussed, or not, according
to standard protocol, and coded all symptoms present in the
text according to MedDRA coding guidelines. The
resulting data were then reviewed for concordance with
labeled AEs as well as with spontaneous report data
received by the FDA [20]. Using the Bayesian probabilistic
model, each post was assigned an indicator score on a scale
of 0–1 by the algorithm. A score close to 0 meant there was
a low probability that the post was related to an AE discussion, whereas a score close to 1 indicated a high probability that the post was related to an AE discussion. The
indicator scores, combined with the drug/condition mappings previously discussed, were used to categorize posts
into one of the following four categories (Fig. 1):
•
•
•

•

Junk: spam (e.g., questionable internet pharmacy
advertisements).
Mention: post in which a drug is discussed.
Proto-AE: post in which a potential event is discussed
within the context of drug use and an indicator score of
at least 0.7.
Health System Interaction (HSI): a Proto-AE that also
describes a health system interaction (e.g., ‘‘saw my
doctor,’’ ‘‘went to the emergency room,’’ etc.)

After the automated categorization, the team manually
reviewed and classified approximately 10,000 proto-AEs
and mentions as AEs or non-AEs, using an annotation
tool developed in-house specifically for this purpose. The
annotation tool allowed the team to modify the post
classification (e.g., re-classify a post in the event of a
false positive) and disambiguate the product–event pairs
mentioned in posts. Subsequently, the indicator scores for
these posts were stratified into ten equal strata and
evaluated.

resolution to conduct geospatial analysis). For the purpose
of this research project, the following additional steps were
taken to protect privacy:
•

Tag as Junk

2. Does the post describe a Proto-AE?
No

Yes

•

Once the data had been de-identified by the vendor, no
attempt was made to re-identify the person making the
post. As a result, no attempt was made to obtain followup information about potential AEs.
Posts from the same person were not linked.

interaction (HSI)?

Yes

Once posts were categorized, the data were supplemented
with other sources of information to help the review process. Supplemental data included:

Tag as Clinical Proto-AE/HSI

posts into relevant categories for drug safety. This figure depicts the
logical progression of classification questions used to categorize
social media posts from Twitter and Facebook. If a post did not
contain a valid product name, it was considered junk. If it contained a
valid product, and if it did not describe a proto-adverse event, it was
considered a ‘mention’. Proto-adverse events were then further
dichotomized based on the presence of interaction with the clinical
healthcare delivery system. AE adverse event, HSI health system

The software platform, from data acquisition to visualization, was undergoing GxP validation during the analysis.
Final certification of GxP validation was not completed
until the analysis was complete.
2.3 De-Identification
The next step was to remove personally identifiable
information (PII), such as screen names, user names, first
and last names, and addresses, as well as any uninformative
vulgar content. A hybrid automated–manual process was
used for removing first and last names. Using a ‘PII dictionary’ containing a few hundred thousand names from a
global database of values, the software removed from the
posts any names that were contained in the dictionary. In
addition, text-based pattern matching was used to remove
URLs and other structured information that could lead to
individual identification. Additionally, any geographic
information included in the post was either removed, made
less specific, or otherwise obfuscated (e.g., truncating fivedigit US postal codes to only the first three digits allows for
patient anonymity while preserving sufficient geographical

Drug labeling to identify which events are currently
listed in the drug’s label and which are not.

System (FAERS) for comparison purposes.

2.5 Statistical Methods
Disproportionality was calculated using the proportional
reporting ratio (PRR) at the drug–event pair level and
multiplicate copies were consolidated. For the sake of
brevity, a single product (salbutamol/albuterol) was chosen
for PRR calculations.


ðaþbÞ
PRR was calculated as a=
c=ðcþdÞ , where, for a given drug
X and event Y pair, a is the number of proto-AEs involving
drug X and event Y, b is the number of proto-AEs involving
drug X and NOT event Y, c is the number of proto-AEs
involving NOT drug X and event Y, d is the number of
proto-AEs involving NOT drug X and NOT event Y.
Multiplicate copies were accounted for in two ways.
First, literal duplicates were identified and consolidated
using verbatim matches. For Twitter data, the system further identified duplicate posts according to characteristics
such as the phrase ‘RT’ (used in Twitter to denote a
‘retweet’). Second, a rule-based approach was developed to
consider fuzzy matches as duplicates using increased
computation power. If a post was nearly identical to
another post, but had a number of characters that were
distinct, then it was marked as a duplicate. This character
length was customizable, and was set at 50 characters. The
duplicate removal process was developed based on a
Bloom filter [22], a computationally efficient algorithm
used to determine set membership. This method allows for

Social Media Listening for Routine Post-Marketing Safety Surveillance

a 100 % recall rate (i.e., all duplicates would be captured),
while the probability of finding a false positive was set at
0.001 % (i.e., there is a 0.001 % chance that a post would
be falsely marked as a duplicate). Multiplicate copy
reduction was conducted only using empirical textual
approaches, and did not include attempts to reduce conceptually redundant posts as has been undertaken with
spontaneous report data [23].
2.6 Data Analysis
Two analysis datasets were created. All publicly available
English-language posts from Facebook and Twitter from
October 2012 to October 2014 were collected and analyzed
to understand the general characteristics of the data.
A second dataset was created from 15 GlaxoSmithKline
drugs with varying characteristics (different dosage forms,
acute vs. chronic, prescription vs. non-prescription, older
vs. newer agents, larger vs. smaller target patient populations). This dataset contained 15,490 posts, collected and
processed using the previously described methodology. All
proto-AEs were manually reviewed along with a similar
number of mentions that were randomly selected from
publicly available, English-language posts on Facebook
and Twitter from 01 September 2013 to 31 August 2014. If
a single post referred to more than one product, manual
curation was used to attribute each event to the appropriate
product, when verbatim descriptions made such attribution
possible. The manual review was conducted by experienced pharmacovigilance staff members (curation team)
who assessed a range of attributes.
The following analyses were performed on the second
dataset:

3.2 Medical Products
Among the medical products studied, those with the most
events on Twitter and Facebook were diphenhydramine,
influenza vaccine, dextroamphetamine, codeine, and morphine (Table 2).
3.3 Indicator Scores
Posts with indicator scores of C0.7 had a positive predictive value of approximately 0.5 (i.e., five of every ten posts
would be relevant for drug safety), while keeping almost
92 % of the true AE posts (2291 of 2496) (Table 3). Note
that a true positive was defined as a post that is identified as
an AE by a member of the curation team. On the other
hand, posts with indicator scores of \0.7 had a positive
predictive value of approximately 0.04 (i.e., fewer than one
in every ten posts would be relevant for drug safety).
3.4 Post Classification
The distribution of post classifications by social media
source varied considerably among drugs. The percent of
posts with proto-AEs varied from 11 to 51 % for prescription drugs (Table 4), and were generally lower for
over-the-counter products, ranging from 3 to 34 %
(Table 5). The highest volume prescription drug (drug E)
had 3,104 posts (all mentions in Facebook and Twitter
combined) during the study period, 1,467 of which were
proto-AEs. The lowest volume prescription drug (drug D)
had only 63 posts (all mentions in Facebook and Twitter
combined), with only seven proto-AEs identified.
3.5 Disproportionality Analysis
The proto-AEs with the highest PRRs observed for salbutamol (albuterol) were mostly known side effects (ADRs)
of the drug or events related to the respiratory diseases for
which the drug is indicated, including tremor (PRR 40.1),
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (39.2), wheezing
(38.7), bronchitis (14.6), and pallor (13.9) (Table 6).
3.6 Benefit Discussions

3 Results
3.1 Medical Events
In Twitter, a total of 6,441,679 events (at the PT level, representing 702 unique PTs) were discussed in the same post as
a drug; 15,650,108 total PTs representing 946 unique PTs
were similarly discussed in Facebook. The five most common
PTs discussed were pain, altered state of consciousness,
headache, malaise, and drug ineffective (Table 1).

Of 15,490 total posts reviewed (representing all tagged
proto-AEs and a random sample of an equal number of
mentions), 3976 (26 %) discussed benefits of the drug. Of
the benefit discussions, 524 (13.2 %) went on to contextualize benefits with respect to AEs, other treatment
options, cost, and/or product complaints. See Fig. 2 for
more details (post text has been paraphrased and/or altered
in non-meaningful ways to protect the privacy of
individuals).

4 Discussion
In this paper, we describe a methodology by which raw
social listening data can be effectively transformed into a
usable format for routine post-marketing safety surveillance. The methodology includes collection of raw data,
standardization of vocabularies, identification of

informative posts, and reduction of noise. Additionally, we
have described how the data can be supplemented with
other sources of information (e.g., product label, sales data)
to facilitate the review process and contextualize the
results. Although this process is a promising method of
unlocking the potential of social listening for routine postmarketing safety surveillance, it is only a starting point,

and several limitations exist. Additional research is needed
to better understand the strengths and limitations of the
method we describe, as well as to identify other methods
that might be used. Since social media is a relatively new
data source, more work remains to determine how the data
can be efficiently leveraged and incorporated into an
overall pharmacovigilance strategy.
Other studies have examined the use of social media
data in pharmacovigilance from a hypothetical or research
standpoint [9–17]. These studies have mostly focused on
investigating the availability of AE information in social
media sources and the necessary technology and methods
for processing it. Academic studies that have proposed
alternative methodological approaches to social listening in
pharmacovigilance were also evaluated in the conduct of
the research presented here [20, 24–29]. In addition, many
case studies have been published documenting specific
drug–event associations, Internet-based tools for soliciting
patient reports of AEs, and disease-related discussions that
also mention AEs [30–45]. Finally, there are studies that
articulate general text mining approaches in pharmacovigilance, including from published literature [46, 47]. In

7,357

contrast, this paper aims to provide practical information
from an industry perspective on how social media data may
be used to support specific pharmacovigilance efforts—
both through a technical description of our methods and a
discussion of how we addressed challenges such as individuals’ privacy protection.
One challenge posed by this data source is that it is everchanging, particularly in terms of its availability. This is a
significant factor because, for this study, only public data
from Facebook and Twitter were used, to both respect
individuals’ privacy and comply with site-specific terms of
use agreements. During the study period, individual
account holders on Facebook were able to designate a post
to be private or public, and only the latter were used.
Approximately 25 % of profiles on Facebook [48] and
90 % of Twitter feeds [49] are believed to be completely
public, although the availability of these data is subject to
unanticipated change due to personal user settings, modifications made to APIs, and other site-wide limitations.
While only including public posts signifies that the reports
are only coming from a select number of social media
users, similar biases exist in spontaneous data sources, in

AE adverse event

which AE reports are submitted by patients on a voluntary
basis.
One important task is to understand when and how to
access the various disparate social media data sources and
how best to evaluate newly emerging data sources in the
context of pharmacovigilance. Because of the unique nature of each data source, we anticipate significant variation
in the potential applications for drug safety. For example,
the character restriction of Twitter limits the extent of
discussion of very complex safety issues. Also, certain
disease-specific websites, such as http://www.lupus.org,
focus only on a particular patient population. There is also
a need to understand where the pockets of high-yield data
exist. For example, which data sources provide the most
information for certain disease states (e.g., asthma, diabetes) and which data sources work well for certain medical conditions (e.g., pregnancy).
In addition to understanding these aspects of the data,
much work needs to be done in the field of ontology
(formal vocabularies). For example, we need to understand
how vernacular terminology is used to represent medical
concepts, how this might vary from site to site, and how

this might vary from one geographic region to another. As
communication methods and styles continue to evolve,
there is an increasing need to be aware of new terminology,
colloquialisms, acronyms, and abbreviations. We also need
to develop data-mining capabilities to capture posts in
multiple languages around the world. Although we currently have a vernacular-to-regulatory language translation
dictionary (e.g., mapping ‘‘feeling bad’’ to ‘malaise’), there
are opportunities for improvement as well as a need for
ongoing maintenance.
Similarly, more work is needed to determine how our

relies on human skill to further train the classifier and
remove false positives, a process that increases the overall
positive predictive value to nearly 100 %. While our current understanding of social media discussion is that its
highly nuanced nature warrants this type of manual review,
additional work in ontology and data-mining could ultimately help us reduce the amount of human effort required.
Because we opted to not link posts from the same person
in order to protect individuals’ privacy, it is possible that
duplicative—but distinct—posts describing a single AE
may have been captured and included in the analysis. We
do not believe that the likelihood of these types of

452

G. E. Powell et al.

duplicates occurring in social media data would be much
different from that of duplicates occurring in other, more
traditional data sources or that this would affect overall
results [23].
Further investigation of ways to appropriately and
efficiently leverage quantitative techniques will also help
improve our understanding of the data. We have described a way of calculating frequencies and disproportionality, for example, but other methodologies could be
tested and new techniques may emerge over time. It will
also be important to understand how to utilize the quantitative aspects, such as quantitative signal detection. For
example, rates of AE discussions are likely to have a
baseline rate and a peak rate that may be stimulated by
reports on health conditions in the media. Informal content analysis of the results suggest that the baseline rate
may be more relevant for quantitative signal detection,
since peak rates were observed to be stimulated by news
media coverage, as has been noted in previous studies
conducted by our group [50–53]. Further research is
needed to determine how best to use these rates and
whether a statistical threshold for quantitative signal
detection may be appropriate.
Other methodological areas also need further exploration. Moving beyond identifying a simple drug–event
relationship to include other elements of sentences in
online posts may help to identify the true essence of the
discussion (we call this ‘topic identification’). For example,
in previous published work from our group, we observed
peaks in news media discussion around drug abuse with
opioid analgesics, but applying topic identification methods
revealed that the discussions centered on a famous person
who had overdosed rather than on patients discussing their
own experiences [53]; content analysis of social media
posts displayed the same characteristic, a phenomenon
known as intermedia convergence [54]. Topic identification offers the potential to distill a large amount of data
very quickly and can provide key learnings to safety staff
in an efficient manner.
In addition to the methodological work outlined above, there
is a need to understand how to best utilize the data for signal
detection. It would be helpful to know whether these data are
best suited for specific drugs and events or whether they can be
used more broadly. Based on the events shown in Table 1, the
following areas may be worth exploring in the future:
•
•

•

Dependence, drug abuse: these terms might be used to
better understand the abuse potential of drugs.
Overdose: this might be used to better understand
exaggerated pharmacologic effects typically seen in
overdose cases.
Pregnancy: using this term could identify discussions of
drug use in pregnancy.

We also need to understand what, if any, additional data
elements exist within posts that might contribute to our
understanding of potential events of interest. For example,
concomitant drugs and medical history information might
enable a more accurate clinical assessment of events of
interest. Demographic information, such as sex and age, might
allow better generalization of results, and natural language
processing technology may evolve where these characteristics
can be inferred based on the usage of language.

5 Conclusions
Our research suggests that social media listening is an
important tool to augment the post-marketing safety
surveillance process. Not only can it contextualize realworld drug use, but it also offers the potential to help
identify safety concerns. Social listening also offers additional data not traditionally seen with existing data sources,
such as benefit discussions. Much work remains to better
understand best practices for using these new and rapidly
evolving data sources. As practical experience is obtained,
best practices will start to emerge and should be shared
among all stakeholders. It will take collaboration across a
range of internal and external stakeholders to answer many
of the questions we have raised.
