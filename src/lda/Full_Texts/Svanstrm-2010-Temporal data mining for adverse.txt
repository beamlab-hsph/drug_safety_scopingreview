Abstract

Background: A rarely used opportunity in pharmacovigilance is data mining
for adverse drug reactions (ADRs) in population-based healthcare databases.
Objective: To evaluate the potential of data mining for ADRs in the nationwide Danish healthcare databases. We specifically considered hospital contacts following measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) immunization.
Methods: We constructed a cohort consisting of all children born in Denmark
from 1995 to 2007 (n = 918 831) with individual-level linked data on childhood
vaccinations and hospital contacts from the nationwide Danish healthcare
databases. We applied a cohort-based data mining methodology to compare
the observed versus the expected incidence of adverse event in different time
periods relative to immunization. With this approach we evaluated temporal
associations between MMR immunization and 5915 different diagnoses occurring in the cohort. In order to evaluate the ability of our approach to detect
signals, we singled out a set of four adverse events previously recognized as
being associated with the MMR vaccine.
Results: We were able to link a total of 3 162 251 hospital contacts and 5915 different diagnoses to the children in the cohort. Previously recognized temporal
associations between adverse events (febrile convulsions, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, lymphadenopathy and rash) and MMR immunization
were identified in the Danish databases by our method.
Conclusions: Data mining in the Danish population-based healthcare databases provides adequate ability to detect adverse events. Pharmacovigilance
using electronic healthcare databases holds potential as an important supplement to traditional pharmacovigilance.

Background
Before the marketing of a new medical product, efficacy and safety have been thoroughly

evaluated in randomized clinical trials. However,
rare but important adverse reactions may not be
readily detected even in large trials, and they may
therefore remain unknown at the time of market

launch. Recent examples include intussusception
among infants given oral rotavirus vaccine[1,2] and
the risk of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy following exposure to natalizumab.[3] Hence,
there is a need for effective postmarketing drug
surveillance systems and, despite its limitations,
spontaneous reporting of suspected adverse drug
reactions (ADRs) has traditionally constituted
the cornerstone of these systems.[4] Reports obtained from healthcare professionals and patients
are registered in passive surveillance databases,
and reporting patterns may identify safety signals
worthy of further evaluation.
An interesting opportunity in postmarketing
surveillance is data mining for ADR signals in
linked healthcare databases.[4] These databases
linking drug exposures, potential ADRs and
relevant co-variates on the individual level are
becoming more and more available due to increased
use of electronic data collection and automation
of medical records. Denmark has a number of linkable and comprehensive nationwide databases
allowing for the construction of large prospective
cohorts with detailed information on drug exposures, health outcomes and relevant co-variates.[5]
The objective of this study was to evaluate the
potential of ADR signal detection in the Danish
population-based healthcare databases. Specifically, we implemented a cohort-based data mining
approach to evaluate temporal associations between measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) immunization and hospital contacts. A set of known ADRs
was chosen to assess the validity of our approach
Materials and Methods
Overview

The general approach of our study was to
analyse differences between the observed and the expected number of hospital contacts with a specific
diagnosis in different time periods relative to MMR
immunization. The analysis was performed with
respect to each of 5915 different diagnoses that
occurred in the cohort. Our methodology can be
subdivided into three distinct steps (stratification

contacts and statistical analysis) that are described below.
Study Cohort

All people living in Denmark are assigned an
individual ten-digit identification number in the
Danish Civil Registration System. This registry
was established in 1968 and contains information
on all residents with reference to date of birth,
death and emigration.[6] On the basis of the Civil
Registration System we created a cohort comprising all children born in Denmark from 1 January
1995 through 31 December 2007. Using the
unique personal identification numbers, we were
able to individually link information on childhood vaccinations and hospital contacts to the
children in the cohort.
Immunizations

The dates for MMR immunization were obtained from the National Board of Health. In
Denmark, all immunizations are performed by
general practitioners who are reimbursed only
after reporting immunization dates and details to
the National Board of Health. The MMR vaccine
was introduced in Denmark in 1987 and since
then has been routinely administered, with a first
dose at 15 months of age. Before 2008, the second
dose was administered at 12 years but is now given
at 4 years of age. For this study, we included information on the first dose only. The live vaccine
in use since 1987 is composed from the virus
strains Enders-Edmonston (measles), Jeryl Lynn
(mumps) and Wistar RA 27/3 (rubella).[7] Since
its introduction, the MMR immunization coverage rate has fluctuated around 85–90% in Denmark.
Hospital Contacts

Information on hospital contacts from 1995
through 2007 was obtained from the Danish
National Hospital Register.[8] This populationbased registry has nationwide coverage and holds
diagnosis-specific information, using the International Classification of Diseases 10th revision
(ICD-10), on hospital admissions, emergency
room visits and outpatient visits with practically

responding number of hospital contacts for each
different diagnosis.
In figure 1, the calculation and stratification of
person-time is illustrated by examples of observed
histories. Individual1 and individual2 are immunized and thus contribute age- and calendar-stratified
unexposed, pre-immunization (lightly shaded) and
exposed (darkly shaded) person time. The unimmunized individual3 contributes age- and
calendar-stratified unexposed person-time only.
The follow-up of individual1 is terminated by the
occurrence of a hospital contact.

complete registration. We included ICD-10 codes
with first letters A–N and R–T, thereby excluding
diagnostic events in connection with pregnancy,
the perinatal period, congenital malformations,
codes following contact with health services and
special purpose codes.
To avoid excessive influence from individuals
with large numbers of hospital contacts, we focused
on hospital contacts with an incident diagnosis
only. Subsequent hospital contacts with a repeated
diagnosis were censored accordingly.
Stratification of Person-Time and Observed
Hospital Contacts

Calculation of the Expected Number
of Hospital Contacts

The children of the cohort were followed from
birth until censoring (death, disappearance or emigration) or 31 December 2007, whichever occurred
first. The resulting person-times of follow-up were
summed according to strata defined by age (in
3-month intervals), calendar period (in 2-year
intervals) and immunization status. The 84-day
time period preceding immunization was stratified according to time to immunization in 14-day
pre-immunization intervals. Exposed person-time
lasted 364 days from immunization and was correspondingly stratified according to time since immunization in 14-day exposure intervals. All other
person-time was classified as unexposed.
Records of hospital contacts for each specific
diagnosis were stratified and counted using the
same strata. Furthermore, with regard to each
diagnosis, stratified person-time following first
hospital contact was subtracted from the total
amount of stratified person-time. Hence, we obtained one set of stratified person-time and cor1995

1997

The expected number of hospital contacts
for each specific diagnosis in the respective preimmunization and exposure strata was calculated by indirect standardization. First, unexposed
age- and calendar-specific incidence rates were
calculated by dividing the number of hospital contacts during unexposed person-time by
the sum of unexposed person-time within each
age and calendar stratum. Next, for each preimmunization and exposure stratum, age- and
calendar-specific person-time was multiplied by
the corresponding unexposed age- and calendarspecific incidence rate. The sum of these products
yielded the expected number of hospital contacts
for the specific diagnosis and stratum.
Statistical Analysis

To obtain estimates of disproportionality, we
adopted methodology and notation proposed by
Norén et al.[9] With the object of identifying

temporal patterns, this approach produces an
estimate that contrasts the observed to the expected incidence of an outcome event in different
time periods relative to an index event (e.g. exposure to a medical product).
First, the logarithm of the observed-to-expected
ratio can be defined as:
Otxy
log2 t
Exy
(Eq. 1)
In this expression, O and E denote the observed
and the expected number of events, respectively.
The subscript x refers to the index event of interest, subscript y refers to the outcome of interest
and superscript t denotes a time period relative to
the occurrence of index event x. Accordingly, the
observed-to-expected ratio has a null-hypothesis
value of zero, signifying no association between
events x and y in time period t. A positive ratio
indicates that event y has occurred more often
than expected, whereas a negative value indicates
that event y has occurred more rarely.
Due to sampling variation, the raw observedto-expected ratio suffers from large variance when
frequencies are small. This might in turn cause
excessive measures of disproportionality, making
it difficult to distinguish actual disproportionality
from noise. In disproportionality analysis of crosssectional data (e.g. spontaneous reports), sampling
variation has been effectively adjusted by use of
statistical shrinkage.[10,11] This technique accounts
for sampling variation in a Bayesian manner by
combining the observed real data with a moderating prior distribution. The resulting posterior
distribution is thereby drawn towards the nullhypothesis value when frequencies are small. As
frequencies increase, the impact of the prior distribution decreases.
To handle sampling variation in temporal
pattern discovery, Norén et al.[9] propose a shrinkage approach in an adaptation of the Information
Components (IC) disproportionality measure. We
applied this adapted version of the IC, expressed as:
Otxy þ
IC ¼ log2 t
Exy þ
(Eq. 2)
Here, a and b are the parameters in a Gamma (a,
b) prior distribution. With this specification, the
ª 2010 Adis Data Information BV. All rights reserved.

posterior distribution for the IC is also Gamma,
t
but with parameters (Otxy + a) and (Exy
+ b). The
specified values of a and b can equally be regarded
as a corresponding number of events being added
to the observed and expected number of events,
respectively. By altering the values of a and b, the
strength and direction of shrinkage is adjusted.
For this study, we applied parameter values a = 1
and b = 1, resulting in shrinkage towards IC = 0.
From the posterior distribution, a two-sided 95%
credibility interval for the IC is defined by using
the 2.5 and 97.5 percentiles as the lower and upper
limits, respectively.
Adverse Events

In order to evaluate the resulting IC estimates,
we employed a set of four adverse events (AEs)
previously recognized as being associated with
the MMR vaccine.
Febrile convulsions: MMR immunization has
been shown to be followed by a transient increased
risk of febrile seizures. Vestergaard et al.[12] found
a 2- to 3-fold relative increased incidence rate of
febrile seizures in the first 2 weeks following immunization. We used the ICD-10 code R56.0.
Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP):
Thrombocytopenia is known to occur after natural infection of measles and rubella and is a
documented AE following MMR immunization.
In a study by Miller et al.,[13] a more than 3-fold
change in the relative incidence of ITP in the first
6 weeks after immunization was described. We
used the ICD-10 code D69.3.
Lymphadenopathy: Rubella vaccine is associated
with lymphadenopathy, occurring in up to 9% of
recipients.[14,15] We used the ICD-10 code R59.1.
Rash: A transient rash occurs in about 5% of
all recipients of the measles vaccine.[16] The rash
usually appears 7–10 days after immunization
and persists for about 2 days. The ICD-10 code
used was R21.
Results
The study cohort included 918 831 children,

follow-up. Using personal identification numbers, we were able to link a total of 3 162 251
hospital contacts containing 5915 different diagnoses to the children of the cohort.
In the following section we present a screening
of all IC estimates for the exposure interval of
0–13 days after immunization and IC estimates
for exposure intervals up to 364 days after immunization for AEs listed in the Materials and
Methods section.

for all diagnoses that occurred in the 0- to 13-day
exposure interval. The width of each column corresponds to the relative occurrence of hospital
contacts with a diagnosis code in the respective
ICD chapters. Furthermore, each rectangle represents a specific diagnosis where the colour of
the square corresponds to the size of the estimate
and the area corresponds to its relative occurrence. As an example, the large red square in the
column representing the ICD chapter on symptoms and signs (ICD block R00–R99) corresponds to febrile convulsions, recognized in table I
as commonly occurring with a significant positive
IC estimate.
As seen from the figure, significant positive
estimates occurred across almost all ICD chapters and did not seem to display any clear pattern.
The highest number of positive lower bound
values occurred in the ICD chapters on injury,
poisoning and other consequences of external
cause (S00–T98), symptoms and signs (R00–R99)
and diseases of the musculoskeletal system and
connective tissue (M00–M99). Notably, most
significant estimates corresponded to relatively
common diagnoses.
Furthermore, it can be seen that hospital
contacts in the ICD chapters on injury, poisoning
and other consequences of external cause, symptoms and signs and diseases of the respiratory
system (J00–J99) were the most occurring whereas
neoplasms (C00–D48), mental and behavioural
disorders (F00–F99) and diseases of the circulatory system (I00–I99) occurred relatively rarely.

Screening of Hospital Contacts 0–13 Days
after Immunization

A total of 13 195 hospital contacts, involving
1095 different diagnoses, occurred in the exposure interval 0–13 days after immunization.
The most common diagnoses were febrile convulsions (ICD-10 code R56.0), unspecified viral
infection (B34.9) and unspecified fever (R50.9),
accounting for 1344, 577 and 398 hospital contacts, respectively. For 43 different diagnoses, the
IC estimate was statistically significantly higher
than the null-hypothesis value of zero at the 0.05
significance level. In table I, we present diagnoses
with the top ten highest lower 95% credibility
bound values. As seen from the table, the three
highest lower-bound values referred to diagnoses
directly related to complications following vaccine administration.
In figure 2 we present a graphical representation, often referred to as a heat map, to summarize the lower 95% credibility bound for the IC

Adverse Events

In table II we present IC estimates and 95%
credibility interval limits for AEs listed in the
Materials and Methods section. The presented
results are limited to exposure intervals up to
83 days after immunization. Febrile convulsions
was by far the most common among the selected
diagnoses, with a total of 30 979 incident events.
Conversely, lymphadenopathy was the most uncommon diagnosis with 130 incident events in
total.

Regarding febrile convulsions, IC estimates
for the exposure intervals 0–13 and 28–41 days
after immunization proved statistically significantly
higher than the null-hypothesis value of zero. The
estimate for the 28- to 41-day interval was, however, relatively close to zero and had just marginal
statistical significance. For rash, the positive IC
for the exposure interval 0–13 days after immunization was the sole significant estimate. With
respect to ITP, only the IC estimate 14–27 days
after immunization proved significant. Similarly,

Temporal Patterns

Figure 3 displays IC estimates and 95% credibility interval limits according to time relative to
MMR immunization. The graph regarding febrile
convulsions demonstrates a clear peak in estimates in the immediate time period after immunization. Estimates then rapidly drop toward
the null-hypothesis value of zero. However, from
approximately 2–3 months after immunization,
estimates again tend to increase, indicating a
slight but significant increased risk of febrile
convulsions in time periods up to more than
6 months after immunization. When it comes to
ITP, the graph is characterized by significantly
low estimates for time periods from 2 to 3 months
prior up until immunization. The graph demonstrates a distinct peak in estimates in the time
period up to 6 weeks after immunization. Around
7–8 months after immunization there is one estimate significantly higher than the null-hypothesis
value. The graph regarding rash demonstrates
significantly lowered estimates just prior to immunization and a transient peak in estimates
shortly after immunization. All other estimates
are fairly close to zero. Regarding lymphadenopathy, there is a similar peak in estimates in time
periods just after immunization. Because of the
limited number of observations, the graph is
characterized by comparatively wide credibility
intervals.

Discussion
In this study, we evaluated the potential of
signal detection in population-based nationwide
Danish healthcare databases by application of
cohort-based disproportionality analysis. The
assessment focused on potential ADRs following
MMR immunization.
The screening of all hospital contacts in the
14 days immediately after immunization highlighted
43 different diagnoses. The most significant estimates corresponded to diagnoses specifically related to complications following immunization.
The significantly elevated estimates of fever and
febrile convulsions were anticipated and were
consistent with the safety profile of the MMR
vaccine. Similarly, lymphadenitis and lymphangitis
could well be associated with this live vaccine.
The increased risk of benign neoplasms of scalp
and neck is most likely not causally related to
MMR. More plausibly, this finding is due to detection bias, given that all immunized children
had a recent medical visit.
With regard to the selected AEs, the highlighted
temporal associations were mostly consistent
with prior research. A transient increased risk of
febrile convulsions, rash and lymphadenopathy
shortly after immunization is well recognized.
Regarding ITP, the elevated estimates for the
first 42 days and the significantly high estimate
14–27 days after immunization similarly agree
with earlier research. In the previously cited study
by Miller et al.,[13] the highest relative incidence
of ITP was found between 15 and 28 days after

MMR immunization. However, the persistent
pattern of significantly high estimates for febrile
convulsions from approximately 3 months after
immunization is unexpected and is unlikely to represent an actual causal association. The noticeably low estimates in time periods just prior to
immunization regarding febrile convulsions, rash
and ITP are likely explained by ‘the healthy vaccinee effect’ – healthy children are more likely to
be vaccinated, thus inducing a downward bias on
vaccine-effect estimates.
In summary, the highlighted temporal associations were generally consistent with earlier research. The results suggest that the methodology
and implementation provide adequate ability to
detect AEs.

to detect delayed-onset ADRs up to 1 year after
immunization. As an example, we were able to
clearly identify the relatively delayed increased
risk of ITP.
The applied approach has a broad applicability
and may well be modified to handle a variety of different exposures and outcome events. In Denmark,
the present approach could be applied to exposure data from the nationwide Danish National
Prescription Registry, which holds individuallevel information on all prescriptions filled at
pharmacies.
We recognize several limitations of our study.
The study was limited to data on hospital contacts only. The sensitivity for mild and moderate
AEs and diagnostic events rarely treated in a
hospital setting was accordingly low. Similarly,
the sensitivity for sudden fatal events not leading
to hospital contact was expected to be low.
We also acknowledge the possibility of residual
confounding. Estimates were adjusted for age and
calendar effects only and, accordingly, other potential significant confounders that may exist were
not controlled for. In particular, the unexpected
results with respect to febrile convulsions may
possibly result from confounding factors in the
underlying population. It should also be noted
that due to the large number of intervals considered simultaneously, a number of false significant estimates is expected.
Lastly, it should be noted that associations
detected through disproportionality analysis should
merely be considered signals for further evaluation and do not imply causality.[21] Conversely,
the absence of a signal does not automatically
mean that there is no causal relationship. The
results should aid in hypotheses generation concerning a possible linkage between MMR vaccine
and the respective diagnoses.[22] In order to confirm these hypotheses additional investigations
using analytical study designs are needed.

Strengths and Limitations

Although an important tool for drug safety
surveillance, spontaneous reporting systems have
a number of widely recognized limitations.[17-19]
The utility of spontaneous reports is influenced
by the temporal relationship between the AE and
the exposure and the incidence of the AE in the
underlying population.[20] AEs that occur late after
use, from long-term use or emerge as an increased
risk of a relatively common disease are less likely
to be detected from spontaneous reports. By utilizing healthcare databases in pharmacovigilance,
a number of these limitations can be addressed.
The data employed in this study yielded practically complete coverage of serious AEs (as defined by hospital contacts) in the population.
In addition, the population-based Danish
healthcare databases provided the opportunity
for signal detection in a large, stable, well defined
population. The cohort nature of the data, furthermore, allowed assessment of the absolute
number of specific AEs in different time periods
relative to immunization.
The specific implementation provided additional benefits. Using this approach, we were able
to assess risk over time relative to immunization.
This feature provided valuable information regarding the relative timing of events as well as a
better understanding of temporal associations
over time. In particular, this approach enabled us

Similar Studies

Recent research on data mining in electronic
healthcare databases has primarily involved sequential analytic methods, focusing on real-time
surveillance of the probabilities of selected ADRs

of specific interest. Population-based real-time
surveillance methodology has been applied to
evaluate the association between selected AEs
and influenza vaccination and selected drugs, respectively,[23,24] risk of selected AEs following the
shift from whole cell diphteria-tetanus-pertussis
(DTP) to acellular DTP vaccine,[25] risk of intussusception following rotavirus vaccination[26]
and the risk of Guillain-Barre-syndrome following exposure to meningococcal conjugate vaccination.[27] Furthermore, in a recent study, Hocine
et al.[28] developed a sequential data mining
method based on the self-controlled case-series
method to assess the risk of Bell’s palsy and
bleeding disorders following influenza and MMR
immunization, respectively. The application of
sequential analytic methods allows for early detection of AEs from newly introduced drugs or
vaccines, while at the same adjusting for multiple
testing. However, in contrast to the approach of
our study and the methodological framework by
Norén et al.,[9] these methodologies are best suited for evaluation of short-term AEs and do not
provide explicit information of temporal associations over time.
Conclusions
Electronic healthcare databases have become
increasingly accessible for research. Although
collected for other purposes, the information in
these data sources could play an important role
as a supplement to traditional pharmacovigilance
for ADRs. The results from this study demonstrate that pharmacovigilance by use of electronic
healthcare databases has the potential to contribute valuable information with respect to public
health and, furthermore, allow signal generation
with adequate ability to detect AEs. Signal generation in electronic healthcare databases holds
particular potential as a tool for understanding
temporal patterns and for detection of delayedonset ADRs.
The abundance of information in healthcare
databases requires techniques for research to
move beyond traditional epidemiological study
designs, inherited from an era when data collection was expensive and yielded only a few facts

for each study subject.[29] Our study should help
generate further research in this area. There is an
apparent need for more studies in order to compare
various methods and fully understand the benefits and risks associated with each approach.[30]
Adequate methodologies must be properly validated with proven ability in terms of detecting
ADRs and minimizing the risk of highlighting
spurious associations.
