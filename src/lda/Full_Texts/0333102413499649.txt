Abstract
Aim: The aim of this article is to investigate the vascular safety profile of triptans through an analysis of the United States
Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FDA_AERS) database with a special focus on serious
and unexpected adverse events.
Methods: A case/non-case analysis was performed on the reports entered in the FDA_AERS from 2004 to 2010: Cases
were reports with at least one event included in the MedDRA system organ classes ‘Cardiac disorder’ or ‘Vascular
disorders’, whereas non-cases were all the remaining reports. Co-reported cardiovascular drugs were used as a proxy of
cardiovascular risk and the adjusted reporting odds ratio (adj.ROR) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) was
calculated. Disproportionality signals were defined as adj.ROR value >1. Adverse events were considered unexpected
if not mentioned on the relevant label.
Results: Among 2,131,688 reports, 7808 concerned triptans. Cases were 2593 among triptans and 665,940 for all other
drugs. Unexpected disproportionality signals were found in the following high-level terms of the MedDRA hierarchy:
‘Cerebrovascular and spinal necrosis and vascular insufficiency’ (103 triptan cases), ‘Aneurysms and dissections non-site
specific’ (15), ‘Pregnancy-associated hypertension’ (10), ‘Reproductive system necrosis and vascular insufficiency’ (3).
Discussion: Our analysis revealed three main groups of unexpected associations between triptans and serious vascular
events: ischaemic cerebrovascular events, aneurysms and artery dissections, and pregnancy-related vascular events.
A case-by-case assessment is needed to confirm or disprove their plausibility and large-scale analytical studies should
be planned for risk rate estimation. In the meantime, clinicians should pay special attention to migraine diagnosis and
vascular risk assessment before prescribing a triptan, also promptly reporting any unexpected event to pharmacovigilance systems.

Background
Triptans are speciﬁc antimigraine drugs generally recommended to patients in whom traditional analgaesics
or acetaminophen are ineﬀective (1). The therapeutic
eﬀect of triptans appears to stem from their ability to
activate the serotoninergic 5HT1b/d receptors in the trigemino-vascular system, causing vasoconstriction of
the cerebral vessels and neuronal inhibition. Despite
their relative selectivity, the vasoconstrictive activity
of triptans also aﬀects coronary and peripheral arteries,
although to a lesser extent (2,3). Most of the clinical
evidence on triptans comes from patients without

known vascular diseases (4). For these reasons triptans
should be avoided or prescribed with caution in subjects with a history of cardio- or cerebro-vascular

diseases and in those with pre-existing vascular risk
factors (5).
Although no epidemiological study to date has
highlighted an increased risk of serious vascular accidents (2), a number of published case reports have
documented serious ischaemic adverse events after triptan use (6–9), and summaries of product characteristics
of triptan-containing medicines list ischaemic coronary
accident (e.g. arteriospasm coronary, Prinzmetal
angina, acute coronary syndrome, myocardial infarction) and serious peripheral vascular events (e.g. ischaemic colitis) among possible adverse reactions to triptan
consumption (5,10).
Overall, ﬁndings from clinical practice surveys have
shown that patients and clinicians seem to follow the
recommendations for the safe use of triptans (11), but
some users concomitantly receive prescriptions that
suggest a contraindication or a potentially increased
risk of vascular accidents related to triptan intake (12).
Since triptan use in the general population is relatively low (a one-year prevalence around 1% with
about 50% of the incident users receiving only one prescription (12,13)) and serious ischaemic events appear
to be very rare in patients eligible for triptan treatment
(1:100,000 treated attacks with sumatriptan) (2), spontaneous reporting data can add further information on
the vascular safety of triptans in clinical practice, particularly on serious and infrequent adverse events. To
our knowledge, no independent studies have been published on this topic. Therefore, the aim of the present
analysis was to investigate the vascular safety proﬁle of
triptans by analysing the largest international spontaneous reporting database (the United States (US) Food
and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting
System (FDA_AERS)) with a special focus on serious
and unexpected adverse events.

Materials and methods
The FDA_AERS database collects spontaneous reports
of adverse events associated with the administration of
drugs and therapeutic biologics, using speciﬁc submission forms according to the MedWATCH programme
(for details on required items, see http://www.fda.gov/
downloads/Safety/MedWatch/HowToReport/
DownloadForms/UCM082728.pdf).
Reports
are
mainly submitted to the database by healthcare professionals, consumers and manufacturers, from the US
and other countries (14). Each report can include
more than one concomitantly occurring adverse event,
and many administered drugs.
Since the ﬁrst quarter of 2004, downloading of raw
data extracted from the AERS database has been made
available to the public from the FDA website (http://
www.fda.gov/cder/aers/extract.htm).

Cephalalgia 34(1)
Information included in each submitted report is recorded in seven diﬀerent datasets: DEMO_ﬁle (patient
demographic
and
administrative
information);
DRUG_ﬁle (name of drugs/biologics and the relevant
role in the occurrence of adverse event; e.g. suspected);
REAC_ﬁle (adverse events); OUTC_ﬁle (patient outcomes); RPSR_ﬁle (reporting sources); THER_ﬁle
(date of therapy start/end) and INDI_ﬁle (indications
for use). Two codes, the ‘case number’ and the individual safety report (ISR), link all the datasets. Moreover,
in agreement with FDA_AERS recommendations (as
described in the README ﬁle included in each downloadable dataset), possible duplicates of each single
report were identiﬁed and merged by considering the
‘case number’.
Adverse events are coded into the FDA_AERS using
the preferred term (PT) level of the standardized terminology of the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory
Activities (MedDRA) version 13.0. According to the
hierarchical structure of MedDRA, based on term speciﬁcity, higher levels of the dictionary (HLT: high level
terms; HLGT: high-level group terms; SOC: system
organ classes) are automatically assigned to each PT,
providing a more general diagnostic classiﬁcation of the
coded event (15).
For the purpose of the present analysis, all the
reports submitted to the database FDA_AERS from
2004 through 2010 were considered. Before performing
statistical analyses, the dataset was prepared mapping
each drug reported as suspected or interacting to its
generic name and to the relevant anatomical therapeutic chemical (ATC) code (16–18).
In order to highlight those adverse events disproportionally reported following the use of a triptan, a case/
non-case analysis was performed and the reporting odds
ratio (ROR) values, with the relevant 95% conﬁdence
intervals (95% CI), were calculated by MantelHaenszel univariate analysis. The ROR is a disproportional measure based on the ratio of the odds of cases in
triptan reports in comparison with reports without triptans (Figure 1) (19). In the present analysis, adverse
events coded through PTs belonging to the MedDRA
SOCs ‘Cardiac disorder’ or ‘Vascular disorders’ were
considered outcomes of interest. Each report containing one or more outcomes of interest was considered
one case, whereas non-cases were all the remaining
reports other than cases. Disproportionality signals
were deﬁned when cases were 3 and ROR was statistically >1 (i.e. lower limit of 95% CI >1).
Since the more general diagnostic classiﬁcation provided by higher levels of MedDRA can increase the sensitivity of signal detection (20), we performed the
primary analysis testing on all the HLGTs and HLTs
belonging to the SOCs considered. In contrast, the secondary analysis concerned only PTs subordinated to

those HLTs previously resulting in a disproportionality
signal: The higher speciﬁcity of the PT level may better
describe the event associated with drug exposure (15,20).
As an additional analysis, six standardised
MedDRA queries (SMQs) considered suitable for the
purposes of the present study were also applied. SMQs
are provided by the MedDRA dictionary to allow
grouping of terms describing the same medical
condition (15).
Moreover, the presence in the report of drugs
labelled to treat cardiovascular conditions (ATC code
C) was considered a rough proxy of possible preexisting risk (see also Table 1S in the supplementary
material). This parameter was used to adjust raw
ROR values (adj.ROR) and to estimate the association
between drug and events independently from the preexisting vascular risk.
The disproportionality signals obtained were considered expected or unexpected on the basis of the
information reported in the FDA Prescribing
Information of triptans (5) and the Summary of
Product Characteristics of triptans issued by the
Medicine and Healthcare products Regulatory
Agency (MHRA) (10).
Data management and analysis were performed
using the Microsoft Access Oﬃce 2003 and Epi Info,
version 3.4.3 software packages.

Results
After data cleaning, the dataset included 2,131,688
adverse event reports. Among these, 7808 included at
least one triptan as the suspected or interacting drug.
The mean reported age of subjects exposed to triptans
was 44 years (total age range 0–90 years) with a female/
male ratio of 4.8:1. Sumatriptan was the most frequently reported active ingredient of the class (73.1%
of triptan reports), followed by eletriptan (10.8%, see
Table 1). Out of 668,533 reports in which at least one of
the PTs listed was included in the ‘‘Cardiac disorder’’ or
‘‘Vascular disorders’’ SOCs, 2593 concerned triptans.

(N ¼ 21) yielded four signals of disproportionate
reporting: ‘Coronary artery disorders’ (adj.ROR ¼

NEC (not elsewhere codiﬁed)’ (2.01; 1.34–2.99) and
‘Aneurysms and artery dissections’ (2.01; 1.34–2.99).
Among 102 HLTs tested, ten resulted in a disproportionality signal both before and after statistical adjustment for concomitant cardiovascular drugs (see Figure 2
and supplementary material). The highest reporting disproportions suggested by the adj.ROR values were
‘Ischaemic coronary artery disorders’ (adj.ROR ¼ 2.08;
95% CI ¼ 1.93–2.25), ‘Cerebrovascular and spinal vascular disorders NEC’ (3.55; 3.27–3.87), ‘Gastrointestinal
necrosis and vascular insuﬃciency’ (2.82; 1.78–4.40),
‘Aneurysms and dissections non-site speciﬁc’ (3.45;
1.99–5.86) and ‘Vascular malformations and acquired
anomalies’ (2.36; 1.19–4.51). Two additional HLTs
resulted in a signal only before the statistical adjustment:
‘Ocular haemorrhagic disorders’ (ROR ¼ 2.51; 95%
CI ¼ 1.48–4.25) and ‘Cerebrovascular aneurysm and
dissections’ (1.64; 1.00–2.68).
In the secondary analysis, several triptan-PT

for the study resulted in a disproportionality signal (see

‘‘Cerebrovascular disorders’’ (2.25; 1.09–4.46).

Discussion
This is the ﬁrst independent study to investigate the
vascular safety proﬁle of triptans in a large spontaneous

reporting database since the consensus statement on
cardiovascular safety proﬁle of triptans, which analysed
the FDA_AERS database up to 2002 (4). Our analysis
disclosed three main groups of unexpected associations:
ischemic cerebrovascular events, aneurysms and artery
dissections, and pregnancy-related vascular events. All
the remaining associations highlighted in the study were
consistent with the already known features of the triptan safety proﬁle (5,10) (i.e. expected), thus conﬁrming
the validity both of the data-mining method applied
and the data source used.
Our method identiﬁed speciﬁc events that were more
frequently reported in association with the studied
drugs than with all the other drugs in the dataset. In
particular, analyses of passive post-marketing surveillance data cannot estimate the incidence rate of an
adverse event because of the lack of both the total
number of patients exposed to the drug of interest
and the total number of patients experiencing a particular adverse event (underreporting) (21). For this reason,
our results should be interpreted with caution as a starting point for more speciﬁc studies (e.g. case-by-case
analysis, case-control and cohort studies).

CI: confidence interval; MedDRA: Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities.

In terms of the demographic characteristics of triptan reports, the mean age and female/male ratio were in
agreement with the epidemiological features of
migraine (12).
Almost all disproportionality signals obtained
appeared independent from possible underlying cardiovascular disorders (identiﬁed by co-reported cardiovascular drugs and used for the statistical adjustment),
suggesting that triptans may represent an additional
risk factor for serious vascular events and conﬁrming
the need to pay special attention to underlying risk
before prescribing a triptan. This result is in accordance
with the ﬁnding of Visser et al., who found no diﬀerence in cardiovascular risk between subjects with and
without sumatriptan-induced chest symptoms among
735 migraine patients who had used sumatriptan for
two years (22). Therefore, the apparent independence
of our results from the concomitant use of other cardiovascular drugs could substantiate the hypothesis of
a rare subjective susceptibility (e.g. genetic variations)
to a triptan vasoconstrictive eﬀect, as also suggested by
some cases of serious ischemic events in patients without pre-existing risk factors (6–9).
The main unexpected signals of disproportionate
reporting are discussed below.

sumatriptan 50 mg can also be purchased without a
prescription. Moreover, on the basis of post-marketing
epidemiological studies, triptans are not considered to
increase the risk of ischaemic stroke when adequately
prescribed (2,23). For these reasons, we considered such
associations unexpected. However, our ﬁndings may
have been inﬂuenced by an indication and/or a protopathic bias. The association between migraine and
stroke has yet to be clariﬁed since (a) migraineurs are
considered to have about a twofold risk of ischaemic
stroke (24), (b) migraine per se is identiﬁed as one of the
numerous aetiologies of ‘ischaemic stroke of unusual
causes’ (25) and (c) the symptoms of cerebral ischaemia
may resemble a migraine attack (26). Therefore, in the
light of current knowledge, an accurate diagnosis of
migraine, excluding all other possible mimicking conditions, remains crucial for the safe use of triptans as their
vasoconstrictive eﬀect on cerebral vessels (3,27) may act
as a triggering factor for brain infarction (28).
Appropriateness of use is one of the crucial aspects of
the safety proﬁle of triptans. The European Medicine
Agency (EMA) recently refused the centralised authorisation for a low-dosage sumatriptan formulation as a
non-prescription product (29) because of the ‘theoretical’ increased risk of cerebro- and cardiovascular
events related to a misuse of these antimigraine agents.

Cerebrovascular events
We found a signiﬁcant association between triptan use
and a range of serious cerebrovascular events such as
‘cerebral infarction’ (patients’ mean age 42.6 years;
female/male ratio 3.3:1) and ‘ischaemic stroke’
(patients’ mean age 40.1 years; female/male ratio
1.8:1). The FDA prescribing information of ImitrexÕ
(sumatriptan) currently states that ‘cerebrovascular
events have been reported (. . .). The relationship of
sumatriptan to these events is uncertain’ (5). Instead,
this information is not mentioned in the relevant summary of product characteristics available in the United
Kingdom (UK) (10), where the oral formulation of

Aneurysms and artery dissections
The second group of unexpected signals concerns
aneurysms and artery dissections, which were highlighted at any level of speciﬁcity of the MedDRA classiﬁcation tested. In particular, the speciﬁc combination
triptan-carotid artery dissection (patients’ mean age
47.6 years; female/male ratio 3:1) was striking. To
date there are no published case reports on this association. A case report of carotid artery dissection after
ergotamine abuse hypothesised a causal relationship
between the two (30). A possible role of triptan in triggering or precipitating such an event cannot be

11

Roberto et al.
excluded in the light of the vasoconstrictive eﬀect of
triptans on the carotid arteries (10,27) and of the multifactorial aetiology of carotid artery dissection.
Nevertheless, an indication and/or protopathic bias
could also have inﬂuenced our results in this case (31,32).

Pregnancy-related vascular events
Our ﬁndings raised potential safety issues concerning
maternal and foetal outcomes related to triptan use
during pregnancy.
Concerning maternal vascular risk, an association
between triptan use and ‘pregnancy-associated hypertension’, ‘pregnancy-induced hypertension’ and ‘placental infarction’ was found respectively. A possible
pathophysiological role of 5HT1b/d receptors in preeclampsia had been already hypothesised by Gupta
et al. (33), who also provided evidence of a progressive
increase in contractile response to sumatriptan during
the third trimester in isolated umbilical arteries from
normotensive pregnant women. Therefore, on the
basis of the triptan mechanism of action, such events
could reasonably be included among the conditions to
be monitored when a triptan is used during pregnancy.
In any case, disorders such as pre-eclampsia and gestational hypertension, which are also related to placental
infarction (34), seem to be more frequent in women
with migraine (35,36).
The second interesting disproportional association
in pregnancy concerns foetal outcomes: Three reports
listing the event ‘congenital arterial malformations’
were found. Although this term refers to very nonspeciﬁc outcomes in few reports, the issue probably
merits further evaluation. To date, available studies
on the safety of triptan use in pregnancy appear to be
reassuring, but lack robust evidence (37,38). A preclinical study reported an increased incidence of cervicothoracic vascular malformation in rabbits exposed
to triptans during organogenesis (10), making this association potentially plausible.

Strengths and limitations
The ﬁrst strength of this study is the data source. The
FDA_AERS database has already been widely used for
post-marketing surveillance of drugs and biologics,
showing its usefulness for the identiﬁcation of serious
and rare reactions that resulted in labelling changes and
in some cases market withdrawals (14). Second, we
applied the disproportionality approach to diﬀerent
MedDRA levels and to the appropriate SMQs, to
increase the sensitivity of the analysis for possible detection of unexpected events (20). Third, the statistical
adjustment of the ROR attempted to control the potential confounding factor represented by pre-existing risk,

suggested by co-reported cardiovascular drugs.
Although the proxy used could generate misclassiﬁcation when some beta-blockers or calcium channel
blockers are used for migraine attack prophylaxis, all
triptan reports listing such drugs reported at least one
additional cardiovascular drug as conﬁrmation of
underlying disease.
Diﬀerent factors should also be considered potential
sources of bias for the results obtained.
Underreporting, selective reporting and residual duplicates represent intrinsic limits of the data analysed (18).
Contraindications and precautions concerning cerebroand cardiovascular events included in triptan package
inserts and labels (5,10) may lead prescribers to overreport such events (notoriety bias). Moreover, since
people with migraine are considered to be more at
risk for diﬀerent ischaemic events and other cardiovascular conditions (24,35,36), our analysis could have
been aﬀected by an indication bias. In addition, a
protopathic bias could have also aﬀected our results
for those events easily mistaken for a migraine attack,
(e.g. ischaemic cerebrovascular conditions and carotid
artery dissection (26,32)).

Conclusions
Although triptans remain a safe antimigraine approach
when appropriately used, this study highlights a
number of reports of unexpected serious vascular
events that may represent rare adverse reactions to triptan intake in ‘real’ clinical practice. Our results show a
range of ischaemic cerebrovascular events, aneurysms
and artery dissections, and pregnancy-related vascular
events disproportionally reported after triptan use.
Nevertheless, the associations discussed here should
not be considered deﬁnite evidence of causality.
A case-by-case analysis of the individual reports containing the unexpected events discussed above is necessary to conﬁrm or disprove the plausibility of a causal
relationship between drug and event, and to add useful
evidence for further regulatory decisions on the most
appropriate dispensing regimen of this drug class.
Lastly, validated signals from spontaneous reports
should represent hypotheses to be tested through
large-scale analytical studies based on clinical databases, in order to obtain information on the estimated
risk rate of the suspected adverse drug reaction in
exposed and unexposed subjects.
Although our ﬁndings need to be conﬁrmed, they
raise concerns about triptan use in patients with
risk factors for vascular disorders and during pregnancy. Furthermore, patients with atypical migraine
possibly related to underlying vascular disorders or
malformations should be investigated in depth before
receiving a triptan.

Clinical implications
. Appropriateness of use is one of the crucial aspects of the safety proﬁle of triptans, as in rare instances their
vasoconstrictive eﬀect can cause severe vascular events.
. By analysing the United States Food and Drug Administration FDA Adverse Events Reporting System
database, this study highlights a number of reports of serious and unexpected vascular events associated
with triptan use (i.e. ischaemic cerebrovascular events, aneurysms and artery dissections, and pregnancyrelated vascular events).
. Although our ﬁndings await conﬁrmation, they raise concerns about triptan use in patients with risk factors
for vascular disorders and during pregnancy. Furthermore, patients with atypical migraine disorders possibly related to underlying vascular conditions or malformation should be investigated in depth before
receiving a triptan.
