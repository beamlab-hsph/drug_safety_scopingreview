Abstract
Objectives: Data mining algorithms have been developed for the quantitative detection of
drug-associated adverse events (signals) from a large database on spontaneously reported adverse
events. In the present study, the commonality of signals detected by 4 commonly used data mining
algorithms was examined.
Methods: A total of 2,231,029 reports were retrieved from the public release of the US Food and
Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System database between 2004 and 2009. The
deletion of duplicated submissions and revision of arbitrary drug names resulted in a reduction in
the number of reports to 1,644,220. Associations with adverse events were analyzed for 16 unrelated drugs, using the proportional reporting ratio (PRR), reporting odds ratio (ROR), information component (IC), and empirical Bayes geometric mean (EBGM).
Results: All EBGM-based signals were included in the PRR-based signals as well as IC- or
ROR-based ones, and PRR- and IC-based signals were included in ROR-based ones. The PRR
scores of PRR-based signals were significantly larger for 15 of 16 drugs when adverse events were
also detected as signals by the EBGM method, as were the IC scores of IC-based signals for all
drugs; however, no such effect was observed in the ROR scores of ROR-based signals.
Conclusions: The EBGM method was the most conservative among the 4 methods examined,
which suggested its better suitability for pharmacoepidemiological studies. Further examinations
should be performed on the reproducibility of clinical observations, especially for EBGM-based
signals.

Introduction
The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS, formerly
AERS) is a database that contains information on adverse event and medication error reports submitted to
the FDA [1-3]. Besides those from manufacturers, re-

ports can be submitted from health care professionals
and the general public. The FAERS structure adheres
to the International Safety Reporting Guidance issued
by the International Conference on Harmonisation,
ICH E2B, and adverse events are coded to terms in the
http://www.medsci.org

Int. J. Med. Sci. 2014, Vol. 11
Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities
(MedDRA) terminology [4]. The original system was
initiated in 1969; however, reporting markedly increased following the last major revision in 1997 [5, 6].
To date, the FAERS contains more than 4 million reports and is the largest repository of spontaneously
reported adverse events in the world [5, 6]. The FDA
releases data to the general public, and this has allowed us to conduct pharmacoepidemiological studies and/or pharmacovigilance analyses.
Data mining algorithms have been developed for
the quantitative detection of signals [7-11]. A signal
indicates an association between a drug and an adverse event or drug-associated adverse event, including the proportional reporting ratio (PRR) [12],
reporting odds ratio (ROR) [13], information component (IC) given by a Bayesian confidence propagation
neural network [14], and empirical Bayes geometric
mean (EBGM) [15]. Associations with adverse events
of interests were previously analyzed for 16 drugs
using reports in the FAERS database between 2004
and 2009 [16-22]. Whether an adverse event is detected as a signal has been shown to depend on the
algorithms; however, of the 4 methods, the ROR
method provided the highest number of signals, while
the EBGM method provided the lowest [23]. In the
present study, the commonality of PRR-, ROR-, IC-,
and EBGM-based signals was examined.

Methods
Data were retrieved from the public release of
the FAERS database from the first quarter of 2004
through to the end of 2009. The total number of reports obtained was 2,231,029. Duplicated reports were
deleted and arbitrary drug names were revised, resulting in a reduction in the number of reports from
2,231,029 to 1,644,220. Signal scores, i.e., the PRR,
ROR, IC, and EBGM values, were calculated for 16
unrelated drugs to assess associations with adverse
events, including 2 antimicrobials (colistin and
tigecycline), 4 HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors
(statins) (pravastatin, simvastatin, atorvastatin, and
rosuvastatin), 2 proton pump inhibitors (PPIs)
(omeprazole and esomeprazole), warfarin, 2 antiplatelets (aspirin and clopidogrel), and 5 anticancer
agents
(cisplatin,
carboplatin,
oxaliplatin,
5-fluorouracil, and capecitabine). It is noted that the
associations of these drugs with adverse events have
already been published [16-22]. All values reported
are the mean±standard deviation (SD). The unpaired
Student’s t-test/Welch’s test or Mann-Whitney’s U
test was used for two-group comparisons of the values. P values of less than 0.05 were considered significant.

Results
Figure 1 shows the relationship among the
PRR-, ROR-, IC-, and EBGM-based signals, which was
commonly observed for all 16 drugs. All EBGM-based
signals were included in the PRR-based signals as
well as IC- or ROR-based ones. The PRR- and
IC-based signals were included in the ROR-based
ones. Therefore, ROR-based signals could be stratified
into 5 groups; signals detected by the ROR only, signals detected by the ROR and PRR, signals detected
by the ROR and IC, signals detected by the ROR, PRR,
and IC, and signals detected by the 4 methods. Table 1
lists the numbers of signals in the 5 groups. The ratio
of the total number of EBGM-based signals to that of
signals detected by the ROR only varied from 3.9%
with omeprazole to 57.3% with oxaliplatin. The ratio
of the total number of EBGM-based signals to that of
ROR-based signals varied from 1.7% with omeprazole
to 20.5% with oxaliplatin.
Table 2 lists the PRR scores of PRR-based signals.
Since PRR-based signals could be divided into 2
groups based on whether adverse events were also
detected as signals by the EBGM method (Figure 1),
the effects of additional detection by the EBGM
method on PRR scores was examined. As shown in
Table 2, the scores were significantly larger for 15 of
16 drugs when adverse events were also detected as
signals by the EBGM method. Tables 3 and 4 show
data on the ROR and IC, respectively. The effects of
additional detection by the EBGM method found for
PRR scores were not observed for the ROR, whereas
the IC scores of IC-based signals were the same as the
PRR scores of PRR-based signals.

ROR and IC, signals detected by the ROR, PRR, and IC, and signals detected by the 4 methods. The numbers of signals in the 5 groups are listed
in Table 1.

IC-based signals were divided into 2 groups based on whether adverse events were also detected by the EBGM method.

Discussion
Several studies previously compared data mining algorithms [13, 24-29]; however, as Bate and Evans
recently concluded [7], different algorithms have
slightly different properties such that one may consequently be preferable in a particular application. If
used for pharmacovigilance, data mining algorithms
should be assessed from the standpoint of early and
timely signal detection [30-33]. Although few studies
have published comparative data, Chen et al. recently
compared the timing of early signal detection with
PRR, ROR, IC, and EBGM using the FAERS database,
and concluded that the ROR performed better [30].
We previously reported that the ROR method provided the highest number of signals, while the EBGM
method provided the lowest [23]. The difference in the
number of signals can be attributed to a higher rate of
false positives or lower ability to detect signals. In the
present study, the commonality of signals was clarified, as shown in Figure 1. The EBGM method was
shown to be the most conservative among the 4
methods, which suggested that it was suitable for
pharmacoepidemiological studies. In contrast, the
ROR method was shown to be the most comprehensive, indicating its usefulness for pharmacovigilance.
These results were consistent with the findings of
Chen et al [30]. These 4 data mining algorithms were
used in our previous studies [16-22], and adverse
events were listed as drug-associated, when at least 1
of the 4 indices met the criteria. However, the results
shown in Figure 1 demonstrated that lists of adverse
events were only identical when the ROR method was
applied, which suggested that care should be taken in
interpreting data when signals are not detected by the
EBGM method.
Based on the number of signals, 16 drugs could
be classified into 4 groups. Group 1 included 2 anti-

microbials, which were characterized by the lower
number of signals. The total number of co-occurrences
with colistin was only 1,491, and 1,906 for tigecycline.
These were markedly less than those of the other 14
drugs; from 33,197 with oxaliplatin to 220,194 with
atorvastatin. The lower number of signals can be explained by comparatively infrequent use, and, therefore, a smaller number of reports in the database. This
is not related to the reliability of the signals.
Group 2 included 4 statins and 2 PPIs characterized by a lower number of EBGM-based signals, and
group 3 included warfarin and 2 antiplatelets by a
higher number of EBGM-based signals. Group 4 included 5 anticancer agents characterized by a much
higher number of EBGM-based signals. The total
number of ROR-based signals was similar among
drugs in groups 2-4; from 619 with rosuvastatin to 884
with cisplatin. The ROR method is feasible for detecting more signals, including false positives, than
the EBGM method. The difference observed in the
ratio of EBGM-based to ROR-based signals may reflect whether adverse events are generally found.
A pilot study performed by Hochberg et al. in
2009 concerning drug-versus-drug comparisons revealed that the rank-order of adverse event rates in
the FAERS database was consistent with the results of
published studies [34], which encouraged the use of
the database for comparisons. In other investigations,
the number of reports with or without normalization
by usage or sales during the corresponding period
was used to compare drugs [35]; however, adverse
events are underreported, which may lead to incorrect
conclusions [36-38]. Signal scores have also been considered inappropriate for determining the rank-order
of drugs in terms of risk; however, few studies have
been published to date. In the present study, the
EBGM method was shown to be the most conservahttp://www.medsci.org

tive among the 4 methods; therefore, it is important to
confirm whether this method can provide important
information similar to that in well-organized clinical
studies.
