Abstract. Adverse drug events (ADEs) are common, costly and one of the most
important issues in contemporary pharmacotherapy. Current drug safety
surveillance methods are largely based on spontaneous reports. However, this is
known to be rather ineffective. There is a lack of automated systems checking
potential ADEs on routine data captured in electronic health records (EHRs);
present systems are usually built directly on top of specific clinical information
systems through proprietary interfaces. In the context of the European project
“SALUS”, we aim to provide an infrastructure as well as a tool-set for accessing
and analyzing clinical patient data of heterogeneous clinical information systems
utilizing standard methods. This paper focuses on two components of the SALUS
architecture: The “Semantic Interoperability Layer” (SIL) enables an access to
disparate EHR sources in order to provide the patient data in a common data
model for ADE detection within the “ADE Detection and Notification Tool”
(ANT). The SIL in combination with the ANT can be used in different clinical
environments to increase ADE detection and reporting rates. Thus, our approach
promises a profound impact in the domain of pharmacovigilance.

Introduction
Adverse drug events (ADEs) are responsible for significant morbidity and mortality of
patients. Current post-market drug safety surveillance activities are largely based on
reports of suspected ADEs sent to the regulatory bodies by medical professionals. This
process is historically referred to as “spontaneous reporting” as it relies on the active
efforts by the reporter rather than systematic screening of a predefined cohort [1].
The major problem of the current drug surveillance system is underreporting. It has
been estimated that only around 5% of all ADEs are reported through spontaneous
reporting [2]. This is partially due to the fact that overwhelmed medical personnel does
not always see reporting as a priority. Another issue is that detecting ADEs may not
always be straightforward, hence can be overlooked. Identification of ADEs on a
routine basis has been rather ineffective. In inpatients, manual chart review is used for

ADE detection, but it is too time-consuming and costly to be routinely practical. To
overcome this problem and utilize the increasing amount of digitally recorded clinical
patient data, several studies have been carried out to monitor electronic health records
(EHRs) for the detection of possible ADEs [3]. However, these efforts usually try to
build ADE detection monitors directly on top of proprietary clinical information
systems (CIS). Hence, each integration is a project in itself, and it is not possible to run
different data analysis tools on top of already existing CIS in an ad-hoc manner.
In this paper, we will introduce the European project SALUS („Scalable, Standard
based Interoperability Framework for Sustainable Proactive Post Market Safety
Studies“), which aims to provide the necessary infrastructure and tool-set for accessing
and analyzing the patients’ EHR data to be collected from heterogeneous CIS [4]. The
focus is on the SALUS “Semantic Interoperability Layer” (SIL) that enables a
semantically standardized clinical data access, used by the “ADE Detection and
Notification Tool” (ANT) in order to detect and notify suspicious cases of potential
ADEs to the treating physician (see chapter 1). The implementations of the SALUS
architecture and tools demonstrate the feasibility of our framework and are described as
initial results in chapter 2, followed by a brief discussion in chapter 3.

1. Methods
Existing ADE detection approaches indicate that computer-based ADE detection is
more effective than spontaneous reporting systems [3]. However, the systems
developed so far are very specific. In contrast, we have designed comprehensive
generic interoperability mechanisms in the context of the SALUS project.
Figure 1 gives an overview of the SALUS software architecture. At the bottom, the
Interoperability Framework is depicted. This framework acts as a means for semantic
mediation, utilizing several medical content/terminology standards and communication
profiles. Using a single mediation framework enables the creation of n-to-n mappings
between CIS and analysis tools to be run on top of these systems. The upper part of the
figure depicts the internal mechanics of the ANT, and its integration with the SIL.
In this chapter, first, the semantic interoperability approach is further described in
section 1.1, followed by a presentation of ANT in section 1.2.
1.1. SALUS Semantic Interoperability Layer (SIL)
The SALUS SIL enables access to disparate EHRs sources to retrieve structured patient
medical summaries to be used for ADE detection. Medical summaries are made
available in a common semantic model, the SALUS “Common Information Model”
(CIM), on this layer.
SALUS CIM is a harmonized data model represented in an ontological format that
covers the data requirements of the SALUS project. It acts as a common denominator
for the existing standards used in the clinical care and clinical research domains. While
building this model, several standard content models such as HL7/ASTM “Continuity
of Care Document” (CCD), IHE “Patient Care Coordination” (PCC) templates,
ISO/CEN “EN 13606 archetypes”, and “Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership”
(OMOP) were examined, and data elements were identified considering the SALUS
data requirements. To avoid creating entities from scratch, already existing
vocabularies were used as much as possible [5].

Two different methods are being used to retrieve medical summaries from the
underlying CIS. For semantically enabled EHRs systems, we use an interface to query
the CIS through the native “SPARQL Protocol And RDF Query Language” (SPARQL)
endpoint they expose. In such systems the medical summary is retrieved in a local
“Resource Description Framework” (RDF) model of the underlying EHR database. As
an alternative option, we implement IHE based standards to query and subscribe to the
CIS to collect medical summaries; namely IHE “Query for Existing Data” (QED) and
“Care Management” (CM) have been implemented. In this way we communicate with
the CIS through standard interfaces and are able to collect medical summaries in a
format conforming to IHE PCC “Clinical Document Architecture” (CDA) based
templates. The IHE PCC templates used in the SALUS project are introduced in [6]. In
both cases, the CIM-Converter component executes transformation rules using the EYE
reasoned engine [7] to represent the EHR response with SALUS CIM data elements.
SALUS SIL supports both query and subscription to patient medical summaries.
The query feature enables the retrieval of clinical summaries for certain patients when a
query is issued to SIL. The subscription feature allows a client application to receive
notifications whenever the clinical summary of a patient is updated in the CIS.
Another important part of SALUS SIL is the terminology server. Since CIS and
analysis applications use different code systems to represent clinical entities, the
terminology server provides mappings between different code systems utilized in the
SALUS project.

1.2. Adverse Drug Event Detection and Notification Tool (ANT)
The SALUS ANT enables a semi-automatic ADE detection and notification of
suspicious cases of potential ADEs to the treating physician. ANT can be divided into
two major processes, the ADE detection process to reveal suspicious cases of ADEs in
the patient data, and the notification process in order to present the detection results to
the treating physician in an appropriate manner.
The primary objective of the overall ADE detection process is to detect currently
unknown ADEs which are of interest to the regulatory bodies. Starting with a patient’s
EHR as input obtained by the SIL, the ADE detection process consists of a procedure
involving three analysis steps. First, the current knowledge on known ADEs is

114

considered to filter out the already known ADEs. Therefore, a database containing
known ADEs was created. Second, several detection rules are executed on the EHR in
order to find ADE indicators. These rules are based on ADE detection approaches
published in the literature, such as monitoring laboratory values, antidote prescriptions,
ADE related diagnoses, reported but unconfirmed ADEs, and drug interactions. Third,
a data mining algorithm is executed that analyses all EHRs of the clinical information
system stored in a pre-processed EHR database according to the OMOP data model [8].
When an indicator or suspicious event is found during the ADE detection process,
the notification process gets triggered. The objective is to facilitate a comfortable
decision making process for the physician, whether or not a suspicious event really
describes a present ADE. Consequently, the information presented to the doctor
represents a compromise between the complete patient’s EHR data and the relevant
data for the decision. The physician needs to see the patient’s course of treatment to
understand the context. Thus, as a part of the ADE notification, we implemented a
timeline visualization enabling an intuitive overview of the clinical data (see Figure 2).
Additionally, the doctor can “zoom” into the timeline to see exact times of medications
and diagnoses, or add further information like laboratory results or procedures.

Figure 2. Timeline indicating the patient’s course of treatment.

Finally, if the physician confirms a notification being a present, unknown ADE,
the ADE reporting system of the SALUS project gets triggered [9] where the report is
pre-populated using the patient data available from the EHR.

2. Results
Two CIS are available at the SALUS pilot sites: (1) a regional clinical Data Warehouse
maintained in the Lombardy region in Italy, which collects data necessary for
administrative and statistical purposes from almost all the public healthcare providers;
(2) the AGFA ORBIS installation used as the CIS at the university clinic Dresden
(UKD) covering 21 clinics in Saxony, Germany.
The first prototypes of the SALUS components have been deployed and tested in
both pilot sites. The retrieval methods of SIL are utilized in these deployment sites and
a unified interface is provided to ANT while consuming SIL. Considering these
different pilot sites, the ADE detection rules of the ANT have been specifically
designed by local experts according to their medical domain, but there are also general
rules implemented that are used in both settings. In the current phase of the study,
artificial patient data for testing purposes is generated in the CIS’ own data formats and
ADEs were detected for those test cases using the whole integrated SALUS system.
Furthermore, initial tests with real patient data of the Italian clinical Data Warehouse
were conducted successfully.

3. Discussion
Different rule-based data analysis algorithms can be used to detect ADE incidents and
report them to the medical practitioners in order to increase ADE reporting rates. In the
past, such algorithms were usually implemented in a proprietary way that is specific to
the CIS on whose database the algorithm would be run. By introducing the standard
based Interoperability Framework of SALUS, we enabled data screening in a machine
processable manner, feeding these data to the analysis algorithms, and sending the
analysis results back to the medical practitioners within an EHR session seamlessly.
In the next months, the SALUS prototypes will be evaluated with real EHRs at the
university hospital Dresden, the largest hospital structure of Saxony, Germany, and in
the Lombardy region in Italy, covering a population of 9.9 million citizens with about
215 million yearly records.
To conclude, one significant limitation of the SALUS approach is that data
analysis is still limited to the data of individual CIS and thus individual health
providers. Of course it would be very useful to perform such analyses on the complete
clinical history of the patient, taking into account EHRs at hospitals as well as at
ambulatory care providers, such as family doctors. Furthermore, it is well known that
“over the counter” (OTC) medication may also play an important role in causing ADEs,
and such information can only be tracked if a complete medication record of the patient,
including OTC medication sold in pharmacies and drug stores could be taken into
account. Nevertheless, we believe that the potential that even today’s fragmented EHR
landscape offers for improving our knowledge about health and care is far from being
fully utilized, and SALUS is certainly one step in the right direction.
