Abstract
Aims: Stevens-­Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis are viewed as the
most severe drug-­induced types of cutaneous adverse reactions, with high rates of
morbidity and mortality. We aimed to examine carbamazepine-­and oxcarbazepine-­
associated Stevens-­Johnson syndrome or toxic epidermal necrolysis, by data mining
the US Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS).
Methods: Reports in FAERs were analysed, from the first quarter of 2004 to the last
quarter of 2019. Pharmacovigilance tools were employed for the quantitative detection of signals, where a signal represents a drug-­associated adverse event, including the reporting odds ratio, proportional reporting ratio, an information component
given by a Bayesian confidence propagation neural network, and the empirical Bayes
geometric mean.
Results: The total number of reports identified as Stevens-­Johnson syndrome or toxic
epidermal necrolysis associated with carbamazepine or oxcarbazepine included in this
study was 1231. FAERS reports associated with carbamazepine were 1048, including
Stevens-­Johnson syndrome (n = 668) and toxic epidermal necrolysis(n = 380). FAERS
reports associated with oxcarbazepine were 183, including 142 Stevens-­Johnson
syndrome and 41 toxic epidermal necrolysis reports. The risk for Stevens-­Johnson
syndrome is higher than for toxic epidermal necrolysis and carbamazepine is associated with a higher risk than oxcarbazepine.
Conclusions: The results of our study are consistent with clinical observations, suggesting the necessity for further clinical research on Stevens-­Johnson syndrome and
toxic epidermal necrolysis associated with carbamazepine or oxcarbazepine.

Stevens-­Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis are
life-­threatening mucocutaneous reactions,8,9 with reported mortality rates as high as 30%.10 Stevens-­Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis are amongst the few dermatological diseases that
constitute true medical emergencies.9
Within the last few years, assessments of drug utilisation safety
during clinical practice have been performed by data mining of large
11,12

spontaneous adverse event reporting system databases.

The

US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Adverse Event Reporting
System (FAERS) is a publicly available database designed to facilitate
the FDA's post-­marketing safety monitoring of drug and therapeutic products. This database depends on the voluntary reporting of
adverse events by health professionals, consumers, manufacturers, and others. Pharmacovigilance methods for quantitative signal
detection were used to review and summarise reports of Stevens-­
Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis associated with
carbamazepine or oxcarbazepine.13

What’s known
• Carbamazepine and oxcarbazepine are associated with
an increased risk of Stevens-­Johnson syndrome and (or)
toxic epidermal necrolysis.
• Over the past few years, safety assessments of drug utilisation in clinical practice have been performed by data
mining of adverse event spontaneous reporting system
databases.

What’s new
• To our knowledge, this is the first pharmacovigilant analysis examining the adverse events of Stevens-­Johnson
syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis associated
with carbamazepine or oxcarbazepine, utilising the
FAERS.
• Furthermore, risk for Stevens-­
Johnson syndrome is
higher than for toxic epidermal necrolysis, and car-

bamazepine is associated with a higher risk than
oxcarbazepine.

This study was aimed to assess Stevens-­Johnson syndrome and toxic
epidermal necrolysis induced by carbamazepine or oxcarbazepine,
based on an analysis of the FAERS database.

Our pharmacovigilance analysis of the FAERS database revealed
that the use of carbamazepine or oxcarbazepine is associated with
increased risks of Stevens-­Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis. The careful monitoring for these adverse events is
recommended in all populations, especially amongst HLA-­B*1502
