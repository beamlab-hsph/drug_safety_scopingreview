Abstract
Background and Objective Oral nucleoside/nucleotide analogues (NAs) have been advocated for chronic hepatitis B (CHB)
treatment with good efficacy. However, less attention has been put on their adverse events. Therefore, a Bayesian network
meta-analysis (NMA) was performed to evaluate the relative safety of five NAs (lamivudine, adefovir dipivoxil, entecavir,
telbivudine, and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate) in CHB treatment among adults.
Methods Eligible randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and prospective cohort studies were systematically and thoroughly
searched until May 1, 2019. Poisson-prior-based Bayesian NMA was performed to synthesize both direct and indirect evidence with reporting hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% credible intervals (CrIs) for serious adverse events (SAEs) and hepatic/
renal impairments.
Results Thirty-three RCTs and 11 prospective cohort studies were identified. As to SAEs, no statistically significant difference was found of any comparison among five NAs. In terms of hepatotoxicity, lamivudine was safer than telbivudine (HR
0.45; 95% CrI 0.21, 0.85), and entecavir increased the risk by 102% (entecavir vs lamivudine: HR 2.02; 95% CrI 1.19, 3.27).
Conclusions The findings from this large NMA could influence clinical practice, and the methodological framework of this
study could provide evidence-based support to analyze sparse safety data in the field.

Key Points
Incidence of adverse events with nucleoside/nucleotide
analogues (NAs) is low.

Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is an extremely important public-health problem, which is estimated to cause ~ 1
million deaths each year globally as a result of the progression of liver fibrosis to cirrhosis, liver failure and hepatocellular carcinoma [1]. In 2014, the World Health Assembly
ranked HBV as the 15th most common cause of death over
worldwide. Although vaccination can prevent HBV infection

effectively in a subset of neonates [2], it is unsatisfactory for
HBV-infected adults. Therefore, effective antiviral therapy is
essential to control chronic hepatitis B (CHB) virus infection
and the progression of its complications in adults.
Fortunately, therapy for CHB has been revolutionized
by the development of oral antiviral agents that directly
block replication of the HBV genome by selectively targeting the viral reverse transcriptase and mitochondrial DNA
(mtDNA) polymerase gamma [3]. Currently, there are three
such nucleoside drugs (lamivudine, entecavir, and telbivudine) and two nucleotide drugs (adefovir dipivoxil and
tenofovir disoproxil fumarate) [4] that have been approved
for the treatment of CHB infection. These oral nucleoside/
nucleotide analogues (NAs) have been utilized in largescale, endemic HBV-infected populations, with good efficacy in clinical practice [5]. However, much less is known
about their adverse events. Although they generally have
few adverse effects and are well tolerated, infrequent serious
adverse events (SAEs) (e.g. death or hepatorenal syndrome)
have been reported [6]. In addition, it is very difficult to
integrate data of adverse events by traditional methods, since
the incidence of these events is very low, and the studies are
often small sample-sized.
A Bayesian idea, which includes all treatment arms as
random effects, can be incorporated with network meta-analysis (NMA) for handling rare event [7]. Of note, exposure
duration (i.e. person-time for a single person), an important
component in modeling safety data, generally follows a Poisson distribution. Poisson prior can be specified to model
heterogeneous incidences of adverse events across different
studies [8]. The methodological framework of Poisson-priorbased Bayesian NMA is well suited for handling the sparsity
of safety data and could provide evidence-based support for
close monitoring of risks of antiviral medication [9].
Therefore, in this study, we aimed to evaluate the relative safety of five approved oral NAs for CHB treatment in
adults, focusing on SAEs and hepatic/renal impairments by
conducting a Poisson-prior-based Bayesian NMA of randomized clinical trials (RCTs) as well as prospective cohort
studies.

2 Methods
This meta-analysis was reported according to the Preferred
Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses
(PRISMA) guidelines, and it also complied with previously
published guidance on the implementation and reporting of
a drug safety Bayesian NMA [10, 11].

Y. Shen et al.

2.1 Search Strategy
An electronic multiple retrieves of databases (PubMed,
EMBASE, Web of Science and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials) was carried out for articles published up to May 1, 2019 using the terms (“hepatitis B” or
“chronic hepatitis B” or “CHB” or “hepatitis B chronic” or
“HBC” or “hepatitis B virus” or “HBV” or “HBV infection”
or “Anti-HBV” or “HBsAg” or “HBeAg” or “liver disease”
or “chronic liver disease” or “CLD”) and (“telbivudin*” or
“ldt” or “tenofovir disoproxil fumarate” or “tdf” or “tenofovir” or “etv” or “entecavir” or “ADV” or “adefovir dipivoxil” or “adefovir” or “3-tc” or “lam” or “lamivudine”) and
(“side event*” or “side effect*” or “side react*” or “adverse
event*” or “adverse effect*” or “adverse react*” or “bad
event*” or “bad effect*” or “bad react*”). Reference lists
from the identified articles as well as recently published
reviews were also manually searched for additional eligible
studies.

2.2 Study Selection
Two investigators (YLJ and JZ) independently reviewed the
references and identified all the relevant studies. Discrepancies were resolved by consensus, or by a group discussion
with the co-principal investigator (YS).
Eligible for inclusion were, on the one hand, RCTs or
prospective cohort studies on initial monotherapy with ≥ 1
of the five oral NAs at the standard dosages (Supplementary
Table 1) among CHB patients with viral replication and, on
the other hand, SAEs (according to WHO classification criteria) [12], hepatotoxicity (increased levels of alanine/aspartate transaminase, abnormal liver-function results, hepatic
steatosis, and flare) or nephrotoxicity [increased creatinine
levels, kidney calculus, kidney pain, decrease of estimated
glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) > 20 mL/min and eGFR
< 60 mL/min] were examined with hazard ratio (HR) and the
corresponding 95% credible intervals (CrIs) reported or such
information was derivable. In addition, studies were required
to be original articles published in English.
Studies on children, pregnant women, or post-operation
transplant recipients; or with patients co-infected with hepatitis C or D virus, cytomegalovirus, or human immunodeficiency virus; or without describing the duration of followup, were excluded.

2.3 Data Extraction
Data on characteristics related to publication, demography,
intervention, and outcomes were independently extracted
by two authors (YLJ and JZ) by using a standardized form.

837

Bayesian NMA for Assessing Adverse Effects of Anti-HepB Drugs

Publication characteristics were first author, year of publication, study design, geographic location, and sample
size. Demographic characteristics included mean age and
sex proportion (%). Intervention characteristics consisted
of drug used, duration of intervention (in the week), and a
number of participants in each intervention group. Adverse
outcomes resulting from antiviral treatment were the number of SAEs or the number of patients with hepatotoxicity
or nephrotoxicity. For published papers with overlapping
study populations, the information was included in the most
comprehensive manner.

2.4 Study Quality Assessment
The quality of studies was assessed independently by two
authors (YLJ and JZ). The Jadad scale was applied to assess
the quality of RCTs [13]. It is based on the description of
the randomization method, blinding method, concealed, and
withdrawals.
In addition, the quality of RCT methodology was assessed
with the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool. This tool assesses
potential bias in the following items: random sequence generation and allocation concealment (for the randomization
of subjects), blinding, incomplete outcome data, selective
outcome reporting, and other sources of bias [13]. Each item
can be given a score of high, low, or unclear. Trials with a
low score in three of these components were regarded as
having a low risk of bias. Otherwise, they were considered
to have a high or unclear risk of bias (Supplementary Fig. 1).
The Newcastle–Ottawa quality-assessment scale (NOS)
was adapted to assess the quality of prospective cohort studies [14]. NOS scores of 7–8, 5–6, 4, and 0–3 points were
identified as very good, good, satisfactory, and unsatisfactory, respectively.

2.5 Statistical Analysis
Design and Bayesian modeling of our NMA complied with
relevant guidance [11]. Person-time, the sum of units of
time (in the week) associated with risk, was calculated from
patient-level information. If the exact number of persontimes was unavailable, the time interval between the first
and last treatment data on the drug of interest was used as
an estimate [8].
A random-effects Bayesian model was estimated using
Markov-chain Monte Carlo simulation by using WinBUGS
1.4.3 (MRC Biostatistics Unit, Cambridge, UK). Poisson
distribution was used to model person-time with “noninformative” inverse-gamma (0.001, 0.001) as the prior for
its variance [15]. The pooled HR and its 95% CrI were estimated by median, 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles of the posterior distribution of HR, respectively. Initial 5000-simulation
was dropped as a burn-in. Parameters were estimated with

10,000 iterations. Precedence codes are partially shown in
Supplementary Table 2.
Interventions were ranked according to their predicted
probability of each outcome, which was determined by
the proportion of the surface under the cumulative ranking area (SUCRA), while a low rank indicated a positive
safety profile for the intervention. Deviance information criterion (DIC) was used to check the overall model fitting [16].
Visual distributions of the network construction included
network plots and comparison-adjusted funnel plots of five
NAs by the NMA package of STATA 13.0.
To examine the robustness of our findings, sensitivity
analyses were performed: (1) deleting studies by using leaveone-out strategy; or (2) excluding all 11 prospective cohort
studies.

3 Results
3.1 Characteristics and Quality of the Included
Studies
A total of 1621 potentially eligible articles were initially
identified. After evaluating these articles and their bibliographies, 91 full texts were analyzed in detail. Finally, 33 RCTs
[6, 17–48] totaling 10,695 participants during an average of
69 weeks of intervention, and 11 prospective cohort studies
[49–59] with 1802 participants during an averaged 91 weeks
of follow-up, were included in this meta-analysis (Fig. 1).
Table 1 provided details of the study characteristics. The
44 included studies represented 11,900 participants totaling 872,816 person-weeks receiving NA treatments, with a
mean of 73.3 person-weeks of follow-up; 597 participants
totaling 30,684 person-weeks received placebos (PLAs),
with a mean of 51.4 person-weeks of follow-up. Most of
the studies were designed as two-armed trials, but two trials
[53, 58] were three-armed and two trials [50, 55] were fivearmed. Among 33 RCTs, double-blinding was described in
30 studies, whereas two studies were open-label designs,
and one did not report information on blinding. Jadad scores
varied from 2 to 6, with a mean of 4.4. Among 11 prospective cohort studies, NOS scores varied from 4 to 6, with a
mean of 5.3.

disoproxil fumarate with 1872 person-weeks. The comparison-specific effect of SAEs (generated by WinBUGS),
including 10 estimations of HR with corresponding 95%
CrIs is shown in Table 2. When the 95% CrIs did not include
the value 1, the HR was considered to demonstrate a significant difference in risk between the treatments under
comparison. As to SAEs, no statistically significant difference was found between any pairs of comparison among
five NAs, which was evidenced by each CrI for HR contains
the value 1.
3.2.3 Ranked Diagram
The results indicate that lamivudine is safer than entecavir
and telbivudine, adefovir dipivoxil and tenofovir disoproxil
fumarate, which are supported by the ranked SUCRA values of the five interventions in relation to the probability of
SAEs, as shown in Table 3. Lamivudine was associated with
the lowest SUCRA value, indicating the lowest risk of SAEs.

in at least one study) between pairs of interventions. Lamivudine is represented by the largest node, indicating that
it was the most frequent comparator, and the edge joining
lamivudine and entecavir is the widest edge, indicating that
the most common comparison in these trials was between
lamivudine and entecavir. However, there are no edges either
between lamivudine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, lamivudine and adefovir dipivoxil, entecavir and placebo, adefovir dipivoxil and telbivudine, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate
and telbivudine, or between telbivudine and placebo.
3.2.2 Presentation of Results
For determination of SAEs, our NMA include 13 studies
involving lamivudine with a total follow-up time of 19,892
person-weeks, four studies involving adefovir dipivoxil with
a total of 1152 person-weeks, 10 studies involving entecavir
with 11,812 person-weeks, 5 studies involving telbivudine
with 7200 person-weeks, and 4 studies involving tenofovir

For determination of hepatotoxicity, our NMA include 18
studies involving lamivudine with a total follow-up time of
25,340 person-weeks, 5 studies involving adefovir dipivoxil
with of 1828 person-weeks, 12 studies involving entecavir
with 12,352 person-weeks, 8 studies involving telbivudine
with 2208 person-weeks, 6 studies involving tenofovir disoproxil fumarate with 1752 person-weeks. Table 2 shows that
lamivudine is associated with a significantly lower risk of
hepatotoxicity than entecavir (entecavir vs lamivudine: HR
2.02 (95% CrI 1.19–3.27)] or telbivudine [lamivudine vs
telbivudine: HR 0.45 (95% CrI 0.21–0.85)].

lower risk of SAEs, hepatotoxicity and overall.

3.4 Nephrotoxicity
A network plot relating to nephrotoxicity is shown in Fig. 2c.
Only 15 studies provided nephrotoxicity data, 5 for the kidney pain, 8 for increased creatinine levels, 1 for kidney calculus, 2 for a decrease of eGFR > 20 mL/min and two for
eGFR < 60 mL/min (Supplementary Table 3). Although one
aim of this study was to compare nephrotoxicity with the
five NAs, further analysis cannot be performed with such
little information.

3.5 Evaluation of the Model Fitting
The model fit can be evaluated using residual deviance and
DIC; we calculated the values of DIC for all outcomes,
shown in Supporting Supplementary Table 4.

3.6 Sensitivity Analysis
The results of a sensitivity analysis using leave-one-out
approach are shown in Supplementary Tables 5–7. Although
a few of the individual studies [40, 44] influenced the results
to some extent, lamivudine and entecavir are consistently
regarded as the safest drugs for treating HBV infection,
and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate performs the worst. The

results of pre-specified sensitivity analyses (excluding 11
prospective cohorts) for relative safety and probability ranking are shown in Supplementary Table 8 and Supplementary
Table 9, respectively.

Serious adverse events; b hepatotoxicity; c nephrotoxicity

Among all 33 RCTs and 11 prospective cohort studies that
were included, the incidence of adverse events was generally
low, and no clear association was observed between 5 NAs
and SAEs. However, in terms of hepatotoxicity, lamivudine
was safer than telbivudine, and entecavir increased the risk
as compared to lamivudine.
Lamivudine is the first oral NA that was approved for
the treatment of CHB (at a dose of 100 mg daily). Although
lamivudine is well tolerated, with an adverse effect profile
similar to placebo in registration trials [18]. In our NMA,
the long-term histological benefit of treatment with lamivudine is clearly blunted by the emergence of genotypic resistance (14–32% after 1 year of treatment and up to 70% after
5 years of treatment) [24, 60]. It is now considered secondline therapy for treatment-naïve patients because it is associated with a high rate of development of viral resistance [61].
Entecavir was approved in 2005 at a dose of 0.5 mg daily for
use in treatment-naïve patients with CHB. Our result suggested that entecavir is the next best after lamivudine with
regard to SAEs. Entecavir is generally well tolerated even in
patients with advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis [62]. In a posthoc analysis of three prospective, randomized multicenter,
double-blind trials, no entecavir-treated patients discontinued therapy because of adverse events [63].
Telbivudine is a potent L-nucleoside analogue that
was approved for the treatment of CHB in 2006 at a dose
of 600 mg daily. Treatment with telbivudine is associated with a higher rate of hepatitis B e-antigen (HBeAg)
seroconversion than treatment with other analogues [64].
However, as with lamivudine, the potential for deriving
long-term clinical benefit from treatment with telbivudine
is limited by the frequent development of resistance. In
our result, telbivudine treatment has a moderate risk for
SAEs, while the highest risk for hepatotoxicity. Adefovir
dipivoxil was approved in 2002 at a dose of 10 mg daily.
The main adverse events associated with adefovir dipivoxil
are reversible nephrotoxicity and antiviral resistance [4]. It
carries a warning of nephrotoxicity at high doses. Severe
hypophosphatemia related to adefovir dipivoxil treatment
has also been reported [65]. Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate is structurally similar to adefovir dipivoxil. It was
approved for treatment of CHB at a dose of 300 mg daily
in 2008 and confers better antiviral activity than other NAs
in clinical studies currently. In a Bayesian NMA of the efficacy of the five NAs, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate was the

most effective for HBeAg-positive patients [66]. Tenofovir
disoproxil fumarate is also effective against lamivudineresistant strains of HBV [34] but has less nephrotoxicity,
so higher doses have been used to confer better antiviral
activity in clinical studies. Tenofovir alafenamide (TAF),
a novel prodrug of tenofovir, was developed to have better stability in plasma than tenofovir disoproxil fumarate,
enabling more efficient delivery of the active metabolite
to hepatocytes when administered at a substantially lower
dose [67]. However, so far there is a lack of research on the
relative safety of tenofovir alafenamide for CHB treatment
in adults, therefore, tenofovir alafenamide is not included
in this study.
NA medications make up an important class of drugs that
are changing the way that CHB is treated. A recent report by
WHO detailed that 66.7% of its member states (126 states)
listed or subsidized lamivudine on their essential medicine
lists, with 48.4% for tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and 34.9%
for entecavir [68]. Despite the merits of oral antiviral agents,
concerns exist with regard to their long-term safety. With
widespread, long-term use of oral NAs to treat CHB infection, more and more attention has been placed on studies that
relate exposure levels (dose and duration) to specific toxic
effects in a real-life setting. A number of meta-analyses have
been performed to establish the evidence-based foundation
for NA use [69–80]. However, all of these studies focused

on efficacy rather than safety, or simply reported isolated
adverse events as summary statistics.
One possible reason for the lack of comparison of the
safety of each NA is that well-designed RCTs with long-term
intervention are scarce, given the recent approval of NAs by
the US Food And Drug Administration (FDA). Another reason might be that the complexity and variety of clinical manifestations of adverse events make it difficult to synthesize
routinely. NA activity against mtDNA polymerase gamma
can lead to mitochondrial dysfunction, which manifests clinically as one or more of the following conditions: myopathy,
neuropathy, pancreatitis, macrocytosis, hyperlactatemia, lactic acidosis, hepatotoxicity, and nephrotoxicity. Yet another
possible explanation is that adverse events usually have a
low incidence rate (sometimes zero), which results in “structural zeros” (where multiple studies have counts of zero in
one or both arms) rather than missing values.
Safety of medications is an important issue independent of their efficacy and underlying diagnoses for which
they are prescribed. As evidence accumulates, even rare
adverse events become apparent. Pooling the rare safety
data from studies of different interventions for particular
conditions is worthwhile to improve our understanding
of toxicity. Bayesian NMA is a powerful tool that can
bring together data to form a network of trials based on
a set of independently performed studies with multiple

844

competing interventions. It enables the expression of
uncertainty about any unknown quantity, to estimate more
parameters with greater precision, because of its borrowing of strength, particularly in the case of sparse data [11].
Meanwhile, random-effect models have the flexibility to
incorporate full uncertainty in all parameters and to yield
more readily interpretable inferences when there is heterogeneity in the intervention effect [11].
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first NMA to
provide an evidence-based assessment of the safety of antiviral drugs in CHB treatment. Evidence-based analysis of
safety data is important to understand the clinical roles of
NAs, to give meaningful support to CHB therapeutics. In
addition, we used Poisson distribution to include the information of study duration in the estimation of background
rates of events under Bayesian frame, which facilitated the
evaluation of potential time-independent risks. This method
has been proposed to deal with varying exposure time [81],
while it may also be useful when there are a number of structural zeros in the data [15]. This methodology takes into
account the time-dependent covariates and between-study
heterogeneity and also adaptively modulates the extremes
in the rare-adverse-event setting, such that the inferences
are robust and reliable. This modeling strategy and overall
analytical framework will be helpful for the meta-analysis
of rare events, not only for safety data but also for efficacy
in the treatment of orphan diseases [8].
Our study has some limitations. First, the assessment of the hepatotoxicity of NAs may be confounded by
hepatic impairment process associated with HBC infection. However, randomization technique helps to control
the unmeasured potential confounders, and the confounding effect could not substantially affect the estimation of
relative risk between two NAs. Second, we could not assess
nephrotoxicity due to limited data. Third, 6 of 38 included
studies were prospective cohort studies rather than RCTs.
However, RCTs often have short-term intervention period
due to some practical considerations such as budget limit
and ethical issue; while prospective cohort studies could
strengthen safety evaluation of NAs with their prolonged
use in post-marketing surveillance. In addition, our sensitivity analysis demonstrated that all the conclusions remained
after excluding these studies. Fourth, although some studies reported that SAEs did not correlate with treatments,
all the data relating to SAEs were included in our NMA,
because the individual study did not have sufficient power to
reliably assess drug effects on these clinical outcomes. It is
very difficult to determine the bias that this inclusion might
cause, it may have resulted in an overestimation of the risk
of SAEs. Finally, only monotherapy results were included
in our NMA, because the appropriate use of combination
therapy has not yet been determined, although it seems likely
to be important in the future in HBV therapy.

5 Conclusion
In conclusion, the incidence of adverse events is low with
NA monotherapy. Among the five NAs, lamivudine and
entecavir are consistently ranked as top 2 in relation to the
probabilities of SAEs and hepatotoxicity. The methodological framework of this study can provide evidence-based support to analyze sparse safety data during monitoring risks
of antiviral agents. Future studies, especially large-scale
multicenter clinical trials, are warranted.
