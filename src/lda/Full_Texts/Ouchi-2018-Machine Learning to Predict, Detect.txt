Abstract
Adverse drug events (ADEs) are common and have serious consequences in older adults. ED visits are opportunities to identify
and alter the course of such vulnerable patients. Current practice, however, is limited by inaccurate reporting of medication list,
time-consuming medication reconciliation, and poor ADE assessment. This manuscript describes a novel approach to predict,
detect, and intervene vulnerable older adults at risk of ADE using machine learning. Toxicologists’ expertise in ADE is essential
to creating the machine learning algorithm. Leveraging the existing electronic health records to better capture older adults at risk
of ADE in the ED may improve their care.

Introduction
An adverse drug event (ADE) is an injury resulting from medical intervention related to a drug, which includes medication
errors (i.e., inappropriate use of drugs), adverse drug reactions
(i.e., harm caused by drugs at normal doses), allergic reactions, and overdoses [1]. In 2008, 1.9 million hospitalizations
were recorded due to ADEs. The rate of hospitalization due to
ADEs increased 52% from 2004 to 2008 [2]. In patients
65 years old or older, the rate of hospitalization due to ADE
is four times higher compared to younger patients [3]. Older
adults experience serious consequences from ADE. One in

five older adults may fall due to ADE, which results in a
fracture, functional decline, and death [4, 5]. Up to 39% of
delirium could be caused by ADE, which results in increased
hospital length of stay, mortality, and decreased functional
status [6, 7]. In addition, 88% of these hospitalizations are
considered to be preventable [3, 8]. In the course of morbidity
experienced from ADE, individuals are commonly evaluated
in the emergency department (ED). These ED visits are significant in older patients—they may signal an inflection point
in their functional status and worsening progression of diseases [9].
Although pharmacists have led the initiative to reduce
medication errors [10], toxicologists have clinical experience
of detecting and treating ADEs. ED visits are opportunities to
identify and alter the course of such vulnerable patients. ED
visits due to ADE is estimated to occur in four per 1000 individuals in 2013 to 2014, and the rate of these ED visits is
increasing from 26 to 35% among older adults between
2005 and 2013 [11]. The Geriatric Emergency Department
Guidelines recommend that all geriatric patients have medication reconciliations and identify patients at high risk
(polypharmacy > 5 medications and presence of high-risk
medications using BBeers criteria^) to review appropriate
use of such medications [12]. Current practice, however, is
limited by inaccurate reporting of medication list, timeconsuming medication reconciliation, and poor ADE assessment. A novel approach to accurately identify and intervene
vulnerable older adults at risk of ADE is desperately needed.

J. Med. Toxicol. (2018) 14:248–252

One potential mechanism to help identify vulnerable patients due to ADE is machine learning. Machine learning is an
approach of artificial intelligence that Btrains^ mathematical
algorithms to reveal potential patterns and relationships (e.g.,
the presence of ADE and other comorbid conditions) that may
not be previously anticipated using existing data. Unlike traditional statistical method with parametric or non-parametric
assumptions, machine learning can iteratively Blearn^ from
patterns seen in the data alone [13]. Machine learning approaches use big data stored in the electronic health records
(EHRs) to provide a data-driven approach to quickly and reliably identify patients who are at high risk for a clinical outcome (e.g., death), as well as to predict future likelihood of
such outcomes [14, 15]. In this manuscript, we will explore
the use of machine learning to identify older adults at high risk
of ADE in the ED as well as to predict the future ADE.

Advantages of Machine Learning
as an Approach to Predict Future Adverse
Drug Events
Unlike traditional statistical methods used in medicine based
on deductive reasoning (i.e., theory-based hypothesis testing),
machine learning relies on inductive reasoning (i.e., recognizing patterns within data to infer associations). Machine learning approaches can account for far greater number of prespecified variables (e.g., single heart rate reading) embedded
within the EHRs compared to a limited number (e.g., age,
comorbid conditions) that can be included in traditional statistical analysis approaches. [16, 17] Most widely used machine
learning approaches are supervised learning and unsupervised
learning. In supervised learning, the mathematical algorithm is
trained using known, labeled examples (e.g., age > 90 years)
to learn by comparing its actual outcome (e.g., mortality) with
correct outputs (e.g., age > 90 years, high predicted mortality)
to find errors. In unsupervised learning, no historical labels are
used, and the algorithm must figure out what is being shown.
The inductive reasoning of machine learning hinges on the
availability of robust data (such as that generated from every
patient encounter and stored in the EHR) and analytical ability
to harness the meanings in available data. Although these
techniques have been commonly applied to biological and
computer research, the frontier for adapting them to medical
research has recently opened.
Traditional statistical methods are insufficient to predict
patients with future ADEs [18, 19]. Such methods are limited
due to selection bias for choosing the variable of interest (i.e.,
deductive reasoning), parametric and non-parametric statistical assumptions, and a limited number of variables included in
the statistical model. Machine learning can overcome these
barriers and predict clinical outcomes more accurately than
the traditional statistical methods or experienced physician

249

coders, such as mortality [20, 21], drug-drug interactions
[22], and clinical impressions documented by the clinicians
(e.g., advance care planning conversations) [23].

Roles of the Toxicologist in Machine Learning
and Adverse Drug Events in the ED
Medical toxicologists have growing experience with machine
learning [24–27] and stewardship in ADE detection/
management [28, 29]. Harnessing the potential of machine
learning in the ED may allow better detection, prediction,
and possible intervention to address the growing number of
ADE-related ED visits for vulnerable older adults. While validated decision criteria like the Beers and Screening Tool of
Older Persons’ Potentially Inappropriate Prescriptions
(STOPP) have been demonstrated to enhance the detection
of ADE, they remain complex and lengthy, making their application in the ED difficult [30]. Machine learning can enhance our understanding of ADE, using the Beers or STOPP
criteria as a training point to create an algorithm that identifies
patients before the onset of ADE ED visits. Identification of
these patients may allow medical toxicologists to concentrate
their efforts towards a high-risk population to prevent ADE
[31]. Machine learning may also identify effective interventions that prevent ADE while boosting medication adherence
through long-term follow-up in identified individuals [32]. An
improved understanding of how to leverage both unstructured,
text (e.g., clinician progress notes) and structured, non-text
(e.g., vital signs, laboratory test results) data within EHR will
help by extracting as much information available to detect and
predict ADE. Toxicologists may apply their expertise in medication side effects and interactions to create this algorithm for
non-toxicologists to use in the ED setting.

Potential Concepts and Preliminary Data
to Use Machine Learning for Vulnerable Older
Adults in the ED
At present, the potential to leverage the EHR data to detect,
predict, and intervene ADE in the ED is understudied. We
propose the following line of investigations to fill this knowledge gap for older adults in the ED.
Prediction models with high accuracy can be developed
using the structured, non-text data (e.g., vitals, laboratory test
results) and established methods like random forest. Random
forest is a supervised machine learning approach based on
traditional decision tree algorithm. Like decision tree algorithm, the data is categorized into binary splits (e.g., age >
90? yes/no) until certain pre-set criteria is met. Each decision
point has an attribute (i.e., the reason to be related to the
outcome of interest) and a label (e.g., age > 90? yes/no for

250

mortality prediction). The available data is categorized one
attribute after another and assigned a final probability for the
outcome of interest. In random forest approach, the data is
split randomly and decision tree algorithm is performed iteratively to generate a higher accuracy for the outcome prediction
[33]. Random forest approach has been used to predict 6month mortality for older adults with congestive heart failure
(a nationally representative 5% sample of all Medicare feefor-service beneficiaries, N = 2,000,000). Using traditional
predictors (e.g., age, sex, comorbid conditions) augmented
by markers of disease progression (e.g., number of medical
encounters), this model correctly classified patients who died
from patients who lived 82.6% of the time (AUC = 0.826).
This was substantially higher than traditional model building
(AUC = 0.563) [34]. This study demonstrates the feasibility of
predicting ADEs using random forest approach. This type of
approach would leverage the entire EHR and yield a much
higher accuracy of the prediction model compared to the traditional statistical models.
In addition to using the structured, non-text data in EHR,
unstructured, text data (e.g., physician notes) could also be
leveraged to better capture likely ADE embedded. Natural
language processing is another machine learning approach
that allows the computers to analyze the unstructured data
(e.g., free-text clinician notes) and learns to interpret human
language. It breaks down language into shorter, elemental
pieces and tries to learn the relationships between pieces of
text [35]. Natural language processing approach has been used
to detect patient-reported symptoms from free-text EHR
notes. Among clinical notes of 2695 breast cancer patients
between 1996 and 2015, 103,564 sentences were analyzed
to detect patient-reported symptoms like pain, fatigue, and
nausea and compared against a gold standard of physician
manual review. The final model achieved precisions of 0.82,
0.86, and 0.99 for an active symptom, the absence of a symptom, and no symptoms at all, respectively under 2 min (>
18,000 times faster than physician coders) [23, 36]. These
studies demonstrate the feasibility of detecting difficult to detect symptoms of ADEs using natural language processing.
Upon successful development and validation of above algorithms, implementation into the existing ED workflow
could be explored to better understand the acceptability and
feasibility of such algorithms to alter the clinical course of
vulnerable older adults.

Pitfalls and Future Use of Machine Learning
to Predict, Detect, and Improve Adverse Drug
Events

the integrity of data entered in the EHR. Intentional or
unintentional omission or misclassification by the person
who entered the data (e.g., harried physician choosing
appropriate diagnostic codes) can greatly alter the integrity, yet such incidences are not readily detectable [37].
Further, the data being used is the product of human decisions (e.g., physician’s decision to obtain diagnostic
tests), rather than the biologic phenomenon itself (e.g.,
empiric mechanism of a drug side effect producing the
phenotype of ADE) [38]. A large number of variables
are included in the machine learning models which may
fit too closely to the data (i.e., overfitting). Such overfitted model may fail to fit in a different dataset and limit
its generalizability. When a machine learning model is
created, implementation of this model into the EHR in
real-time clinical practice will be an additional barrier to
its usefulness. The machine learning algorithms may not
surpass the human judgment; rather, they could be a powerful tool to circumvent when correctly applied by trained
clinicians. Finally, machine learning algorithms are designed to discover meaning within data (i.e., associations)
and may not be interpreted as causality (i.e., predictors
may not cause ADEs).
In the future, integration of other sources of data that may
predict ADE may enhance the predictive strength of a machine learning algorithm. For example, investigations that integrate wearable biosensor data which has previously identified opioid use may be combined with EHR prescribing data
to identify the onset of ADE in this population, prompting
intervention by a medical toxicologist [39, 40].

Conclusion
Machine learning approaches can be an innovative method to
predict, detect, and intervene adverse drug events in the ED.
Toxicologists’ expertise in adverse drug events is essential to
creating the machine learning algorithm. Leveraging the
existing electronic health records to better capture older adults
at risk of adverse drug events in the ED may improve their
care.
