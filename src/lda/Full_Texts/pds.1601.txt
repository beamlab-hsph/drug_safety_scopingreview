SUMMARY
Purpose To examine the concordance of various measures to Bayesian Confidence Propagation Neural Network (BCPNN)
measure used by the WHO Collaborating Centre for International Drug Monitoring based on the database of Guangdong
province in China.
Methods The Reporting Odds Ratio (ROR)  1.96 standard errors (SE), Proportional Reporting Ratio (PRR)  21.96 SE,
combination x2-PRR measure used by the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) were compared
with the IC  2 standard deviations (SDs) with the tested database collected from 1 January 2002 to 30 June 2007 in
Guangdong. Additionally, the concordance of the various measures, in respect to the number of reports per combination, was
examined.
Results Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value were high in respect to the BCPNN
measure when a combination of point and interval estimate was used based on four types of signal detection for the ROR and
PRR measures, and the four evaluation indexes increased when A (the number of reports per combination) increased.
However the MHRA measure had decreasing sensitivity and increasing specificity with A increasing.
Conclusions The ROR, PRR and BCPNN measures used are broadly comparable when three or more cases per
combination have been collected. The MHRA measure is comparable to the BCPNN when seven or less case per
combination have been collected for ‘drug–ADR’, ‘drug category–ADR’, ‘drug–ADR category’ combinations based on
the Guangdong database, and the MHRA is unsuitable for detecting signals from ‘drug category–ADR category’
combinations based on the Guangdong database because of its low sensitivity. Copyright # 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

fast and reasonably efficient way of detecting adverse
drug reactions (ADRs).1 Over the years, in various
centres, different measures are applied to quantify
the extent to which an ADR is reported disproportionally to a certain drug compared to the generality
of the SRS database, such as the proportional ADR
reporting ratio (PRR) and the reporting odds ratio
(ROR), combination x2 test-PRR measure used by
the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory
Agency (MHRA), and Bayesian Confidence

WHO Collaborating Centre for International Drug
Monitoring (the Uppsala Monitoring Centre).2–8
There is no ‘gold standard’ that establishes universal
thresholds for ‘statistical signals’ currently. The
various measures that are being applied in quantitative
signal detection in various national centres are
comparable when four or more reports constitute
the drug–ADR combinations.6
Guangdong ADR SRS was set up in 2001. It is a
large database now, and about 3000–5000 new reports
are added quarterly. The task of trying to find new
drug–ADR signals by manual review is daunting.
Automatic quantitative signal detection system is
needed to be established urgently in Guangdong.
Guangdong database covers the 21 cities of Guangdong
province with a population over 82.9 million for drug
monitoring. The database reflects the characteristics and
quality of ADR reports about Chinese, for example, the
frequency distribution of the count of drug–ADR pairs.
It is a part of Chinese national database, which covers a
population over 1.3 billion and reports over 0.36 million
per year. Because of the specificity of Guangdong
database, the adaptability of various measures needs to
be confirmed. All results of comparison are based on
other countries’ databases, but no research had
performed in Guangdong in practice. It is necessary
to take a comparison of measures of disproportionality
for signal detection on ADR spontaneous reporting
database of Guangdong province in China.
The aim of this study is to examine the concordance
of the various measures, and to clarify the way they are
related to each other, when applied to the dataset of
suspected ADRs reported to Guangdong Monitoring
Centre. Although various approaches differ from each
other in the principles and the methodology, they
all share the same characteristics that they search
the databases for disproportionality. Since all the
measures of disproportionality are based on the same
principles of calculation using a 2  2 table, results
should be closely concordant.
The BCPNN method has been tested for performance for signal determination against standard
literature sources on a retrospective basis and used
as reference standard.6–8 So it was decided to express
the level of concordance of the other measures with
the BCPNN in our study.

province for drug monitoring contains 41 596 reports
from the beginning of year 2002 to 30 June 2007 based
on the SRS. It includes many instances of multiple
drugs and multiple reactions. Generic names for drug
records were standardised based on new pharmacology.9 ADR names were coded with the WHO
Adverse Reaction Terminology.10
Relating to the hierarchies in the dictionaries, four
types including ‘drug–ADR signal detection’, ‘drug–
ADR category signal detection’, ‘drug category–ADR
signal detection’ and ‘drug category–ADR category
signal detection’ were constructed in the SRS. For
example, four types of signal detection, which means
detection for ‘cefradine induced haematuria’, ‘cefradine
induced urinary system disorders’, ‘cephalosporins
induced haematuria’ and ‘cephalosporins induced
urinary system disorders’. The data presented in
‘drug–ADR’ signal detection which is carried out at
the level of specific drug and preferred term are the most
important and those in other three types signal detection
are extremely useful adjuncts.
It is generally agreed that, in most circumstances, at
least three cases are required to generate a signal from
spontaneous ADR data. Four measures were applied to
detect signals in the Guangdong database for the
number of reports per combination more than 2.
Four measures for disproportionality
Based on a 2  2 table and with respect to the
background frequency of associations of drugs and
suspected ADRs in the database, the following point and
interval estimates were calculated for all combinations:
IC  2 standard deviations (SD) (for BCPNN),
ROR  1.96 standard error (SE), PRR  1.96SE and
PRR and x2 with Yates correction (for MHRA). A is the
number of combinations between a specific drug and a
suspected ADR, and a positive association of the
MHRA was defined as PRR  2, A  3 and x2  4.
In addition, a positive association of the ROR, PRR
and BCPNN was defined as ROR  1.96SE > 1,
PRR  1.96SE > 1 and IC  2SD > 0, respectively.
For ROR  1.96SE, PRR  1.96SE and MHRA
(PRR and x2), sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value as well as
the number of cases in which the various measures
could be calculated, were determined with IC  2SD
as the reference measure.

calculation were shown in Table 1. The first quartile
(Q1), Q2 and Q3 of ‘drug–ADR’ combinations was 3,
5 and 11, respectively. Considering the sample size,
we calculated sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value based on
A  3, A  4, A  5, A  6 and A  7 for the four types
of combinations. In addition, the four evaluation
indexes were calculated based on A  11 for
‘drug–ADR’ combinations, A  15 for ‘drug–ADR
category’ combinations, A  17 for ‘drug category–
ADR’ combinations and A  13 and A  40 for ‘drug

of combinations, for which a point estimate could be
calculated, is provided. The ROR and PRR measures
have high sensitivity. However the sensitivity of the
MHRA decreases from 0.91 to 0.79 when the number
of per combination increased from A  3 to A  11.
All specificities of the three measures increase when
the number of per combination increases, especially to
the MHRA measure.
Results of ‘drug–ADR category’
combination database
The ROR  1.96SE, PRR  1.96SE and MHRA of 56
cases cannot be calculated from the database. Table 5
shows the changes of evaluation indexes of the tested
three measures with the number of reports for
‘drug–ADR category’ combinations changed, which
is in concordance with the results for ‘drug–ADR’
combinations. For ‘drug–ADR category’ combinations,
it has higher specificity than that for ‘drug–ADR’ signal
detection. The specificities of the ROR, PRR and
MHRA are 0.88, 0.88 and 0.96, respectively when
A  3, and which reach to 0.94, 0.94 and 0.99,
respectively when the combinations of A  15 were
selected (734 combinations were selected).

RESULTS
Signal detection results of Guangdong monitoring
database collected during 1 January 2002 and 30 June
2007 when A  3 are shown in Table 3. The PRR
detected more potential signals than those mined by
the other three measures. These signals should be
distinguished from ‘clinical’ significant ones.

high specificity. However the MHRA measure has the
lowest sensitivity in the three tested measures
(Table 6).
Results of ‘drug category–ADR category’
combination database
The ROR  1.96SE of six cases, PRR  1.96SE and
MHRA of two cases cannot be obtained from the
database. The MHRA measure has the lowest
sensitivity (0.38 when A  40) and highest specificity
(1.00 when A  40) for ‘drug category–ADR
category’ combinations (Table 7).
DISCUSSIONS
We have compared four measures to detect signals in
Guangdong database for the number of reports per
combination more than 2. Two is a temporary
statistical threshold of ‘interestness’ but not a clinical
one. For the ROR and PRR measures, results are more

comparable with IC  2SD when the number of
reports per combination increases. The PRR and ROR
have comparable sensitivity, specificity, positive
predictive value and negative predictive value, but
the results using the PRR measure are different to the
results by the MHRA measure. A positive association
of the MHRA was defined as PRR  2, A  3 and
x2  4, while a positive association of the PRR was
defined as PRR  1.96SE > 1. The sensitivity of the
MHRA decreased when the number of reports per
combination increased, so the MHRA measure was
unsuitable for detecting signals when higher A
collected from Guangdong database referred to the
BCPNN method. The MHRA is not necessarily
‘worse’ because there is no gold standard.
An alternative method of comparison could have
been used such as the k statistic, but van Puijenbroek
et al. proposed that the method did not distinguish
between a situation of high sensitivity and low
specificity, and one of poor sensitivity and high
specificity.6 Another method of comparison could

have been used such as correlation coefficient, but it
has the same drawback with k statistic. Correlation
coefficient was analysed between the ROR and the
BCPNN and higher correlation coefficient (spearman
r ¼ 0.96) was obtained. However, the top 10 strong
signals detected by the ROR are very different to
the top 10 strong signals detected by the BCPNN.
Only ‘Haloperidol–Dystonia’ association is common
strong signal detected by the two measures about
‘drug–ADR’ signal detection in the Guangdong
SRS database (Appendix), and only ‘Aprotinin–
haematological system ADR’ is common strong

signal of the top 10 for ‘drug–ADR category’ signal
detection. In addition, there are three common strong
signals detected by the ROR and BCPNN measures
on the top 10 list for both ‘drug category–ADR’
associations and ‘drug category–ADR category’
associations. So the highest signal score doesn’t
represent the strongest signal.
For the ROR and PRR, sensitivity is still high with
respect to IC  2SD, but specificity declines with A.
This implies that all combinations highlighted as
potential signals by the BCPNN are also highlighted
by the ROR and PRR measures, whereas not all

combinations mined by the other measures have a
positive IC  2SD. Discrimination of true and false
signals is becoming harder due to the lack of a gold
standard.6 Higher sensitivity reflects lower false
negative rate, and higher specificity represents lower
false positive rate. False negative and false positive
both have risk to some extent. Method selecting is
based on what should be paid more attention,
sensitivity or specificity. If the risk of making false
positive error is higher than the risk of making false
negative error, we choose the method with higher
specificity. However our main concern is to avoid
missing important signals for ADR signal detection.
Every measure has its advantages and disadvantages. The ROR, PRR and MHRA are always
applicable and easy for calculation. However point
estimate and SE cannot always be calculated. Just as
mentioned above, the ROR  1.96SE of 13 cases,
PRR  1.96SE and MHRA of 5 cases cannot be
obtained from the ‘drug–ADR’ combinations database. The BCPNN is always applicable and efficient
calculation for large numbers, but it is relatively
nontransparent for people unfamiliar with Bayesian
statistics. Regardless of which method being used, the
results of the quantitative approach should be
considered as additional information and be interpreted in combination with clinical information,
findings reported in the literature and other sources.1

Signal analysis and interpretation is still the decisive
factor in the signal detection process.
Although similar studies have been carried out in
the past with comparable results, we compared
different methods using Guangdong database in which
the frequency distribution of A is different from other
databases and considered four types of signal
detection based on the hierarchies in the dictionaries.
Another uniqueness of our study is that the quartiles
were considered as cut points to examine the
concordance of the various measures with respect to
the number of reports per combination. Different
databases induced different consequences. For
example, Kubota et al. 8 revealed that the sensitivity
of the MHRA was 0.98, 0.97 and 0.95 when A  3,
A  4 and A  6, respectively, and the sensitivity of the
MHRA measure decreased when A increased. We
obtained 0.91, 0.90 and 0.87 from ‘drug–ADR’ signal
detection in our research, showing declining trend.
Similar trends between the comparable studies may be
attributed to the criterion of the MHRA measure.
Different values mentioned above are likely to be
related with different databases. The highest number
of reports for ‘drug–ADR’ combinations collected
from the Guangdong database is 997, which means
that 997 reports about the same combination were
observed. These cut off values such as 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 11,
15, 17 and 40 were obtained based on the frequency

measure is comparable to the BCPNN when seven
or less case per combination have been collected for
‘drug–ADR’, ‘drug category–ADR’ and ‘drug–ADR
category’ combinations based on the Guangdong
database, and the MHRA is unsuitable for detecting
signals for ‘drug category–ADR category’ combinations based on the Guangdong database because of
its low sensitivity.

KEY POINTS
 Four measures for detecting possible ADR signals are compared based on Guangdong spontaneous reporting database considering the
frequency distribution of A (the number of
reports per combination) and four types of singal
detection.
 Four indexes, sensitivity, specificity, positive
predictive value and negative predictive value,
are applied to evaluate the concordance of the
various measures.

distribution of A. If we choose 2, 3, 4 and 6 as cut
points (It was the choice of van Puijenbroek et al. and
Kubota et al.) instead of the quartiles, the corresponding number of combinations is with minute change,
and the dramatic-decreased trend of the sensitivity
with A increased might not be found.
Although no gold standard is available, each
measure has its own advantages and disadvantages
with respect to applicability in different situations and
possibility for implementation. Quantitative detection
of significant signals from the database of Guangdong
drug monitoring is an extremely useful adjunct to the
expert assessment of very large numbers of spontaneously reported ADRs. Automatic signal detection
system can greatly enhance the efficiency of ADR
monitoring and find out new drug–ADR signals and
important safety problems in China.
