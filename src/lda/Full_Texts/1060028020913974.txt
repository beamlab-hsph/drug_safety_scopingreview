Abstract
Background: Osteoporosis, which is a major public health concern, has been known to reduce health-related quality
of life. Some studies have suggested that antipsychotics could perhaps cause osteoporosis by increasing serum prolactin
levels. However, the association between antipsychotics and the risk for developing osteoporosis has been controversial.
Objective: The present study aimed to assess the association between antipsychotic use and onset of osteoporosis in
real-world settings. Methods: A multimethod data-mining approach using different algorithms and databases was used.
First, disproportionality analysis was conducted using the US Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting
System (FAERS) database (2004-2017) with reporting odds ratio (ROR) and information component (IC) being used
to indicate a signal. Furthermore, a sequence symmetry analysis using data from a large Japanese administrative claims
database (2005-2017; JMDC Inc, Japan) was conducted. Short-term intervals (ie, 12, 24, and 36 months) were set to
investigate the association between antipsychotic use and onset of osteoporosis using the adjusted sequence ratio (SR)
to indicate a signal. Results: No potential association between osteoporosis and all antipsychotics was observed in
the FAERS database, except for perphenazine, which exhibited significant signals using both ROR and IC. Moreover, no
potential association between osteoporosis and antipsychotics was observed in the JMDC claims database, except for
sulpiride and aripiprazole. None of the antipsychotics indicated significant signals using all analyzed items (ROR, IC, and
adjusted SR). Conclusion and Relevance: Real-world data show no association between antipsychotic use and the
onset of osteoporosis. Further pharmacoepidemiological studies are needed for causality assessment.

Introduction
Osteoporosis, which is defined as a systemic skeletal disease characterized by low bone mineral density and microarchitectural deterioration of the bone tissue that induce
increased bone fragility and fracture risk, has posed a major
public health concern and is the most frequently occurring
debilitating disease. Consequently, osteoporotic fractures
have been found to reduce health-related quality of life.1
Several etiologies for osteoporosis, which is of 2 types
(ie, primary and secondary), have been investigated.
Accordingly, primary osteoporosis has been known to be
primarily caused by aging and menopause for a long latent
period,2 whereas secondary osteoporosis can be induced by
the use of certain drugs. Whereas glucocorticoid-induced
osteoporosis is the most common form of secondary osteoporosis,3 and most of the bone loss occurs during the first 6
months of corticosteroid treatment, some studies have suggested that antipsychotics could perhaps cause the same.4

Antipsychotic-induced blockade of dopamine D2 receptors
increases serum prolactin levels, which in turn suppresses
gonadotropin secretion. Consequently, hypogonadism
increases osteoclast activity and decreases osteoblast activity. Prolactinoma, which induces prolactin hypersecretion,
has also been reported to increase the risk for developing
osteoporosis.5 Nonetheless, the association between antipsychotic-induced hyperprolactinemia and the risk for
developing osteoporosis has been controversial.
Data-mining approaches using real-world data have been
utilized in pharmacovigilance for the rapid determination of

the association between drugs and adverse events. These
methods, which include disproportionality analysis (DPA)
and sequence symmetry analysis (SSA), detect the potential
association between a drug and an adverse event using signals. DPA has been used in postmarketing surveillance signal detection from spontaneous reporting systems,6 whereas
SSA has been used for investigating the association between
drugs and outcomes using the administrative claims
database.7,8 Considering some reports in multimethod
approaches using different algorithms and databases,9,10 the
present study aimed to investigate the association between
antipsychotics and osteoporosis using a multimethod approach.

with each version of MedDRA. The SMQ “20000178:
Osteoporosis/osteopenia” contained 10 preferred terms
(10049470: Bone density decreased; 10056809: Bone formation decreased; 10065687: Bone loss; 10064269: Bone marrow edema syndrome; 10049088: Osteopenia; 10031282:
Osteoporosis; 10031285: Osteoporosis postmenopausal;
10031290: Osteoporotic fracture; 10038642: Bone resorption increased; and 10039984: Senile osteoporosis). Preferred
terms for “10020739: Hyperprolactinemia” were also identified as a positive control.

Methods

DPA was originally developed to determine associations
between the use of certain targeted drugs and potential
adverse events. The present study used reporting odds ratio
(ROR) and information component (IC) to detect spontaneous report signals calculated according to previously
reported methods.11 Accordingly, a significant signal was
detected when the lower limit of the 2-sided 95% CI was
more than 1 for ROR or more than 0 for IC. The current
study utilized 2 methods with different algorithms to detect
significant signals.

Antipsychotics
The present study investigated first-generation antipsychotics chlorpromazine, levomepromazine, perphenazine, haloperidol, and sulpiride and second-generation antipsychotics
olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone, aripiprazole, paliperidone, blonanserin, and perospirone.

Analysis of the US Food and Drug
Administration Adverse Event Reporting System
Database
The US Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event
Reporting System (FAERS) database was accessed from the
US Food and Drug Administration’s website (https://www.
fda.gov/drugs/surveillance/questions-and-answers-fdasadverse-event-reporting-system-faers). The present study
included data from the first quarter of 2004 until the end of
2017, obtaining a total of 111 999 562 reports. Preferred terms
from the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities
(MedDRA version 22.0) were used to classify adverse events.
Arbitrary drug names, including trade names and abbreviations, were mapped into unified generic names via text mining
using the Martindale website (https://www.medicinescomplete.com). Each antipsychotic drug was identified by linking
the aforementioned archive with the FAERS database. All
records related to each antipsychotic drug in the DRUG files
were selected, after which relevant reactions from the
REACTION files were identified.
Adverse events in the FAERS database were coded using
MedDRA preferred terms, which are grouped by defined
medical conditions of the area of interest. Preferred terms
related to osteoporosis or hyperprolactinemia were identified
using standardized MedDRA version 22.0 queries.
Spontaneously reported adverse events related to osteoporosis were identified using the preferred terms in the standardized MedDRA Queries (SMQ) “20000178: Osteoporosis/
osteopenia.” SMQs are validated and maintained by the
Maintenance and Support Services organization and updated

Signal Detection Via Disproportionality Analysis

Analysis of JMDC Administrative Claims
Database
The JMDC administrative claims database is a large and
chronologically organized Japanese claims database (JMDC
Inc, Japan) that uses standardized disease classifications and
anonymous record linkage.12 This database (January 2005 to
April 2017) includes a total of approximately 4.1 million
insured individuals in Japan (approximately 3.2% of the
population) and mainly comprises company employees and
their family members. It provides information on beneficiaries, including encrypted personal identifiers, age, sex, and
International Statistical Classification of Diseases and
Related Health Problems 10th Revision (ICD-10), and procedure and diagnostic codes, as well as the name and dose of
the prescribed and/or dispensed drugs and number of days
they were supplied. All drugs were coded according to the
Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) Classification of
both the European Pharmaceutical Market Research
Association and World Health Organization. An encrypted
personal identifier was used to link claims data from various
hospitals, clinics, and pharmacies.

Rationale for Sequence Symmetry Analysis
SSA, which is highly specific for detecting adverse events
using claims databases, was performed to evaluate the association between the use of certain targeted drugs and outcomes of interest.13 SSA evaluates the asymmetry in the
distribution of an incident event before and after the

990
initiation of a specific medication, which may indicate an
association between a specific treatment of interest and outcome. The crude sequence ratio (SR) is defined as the ratio
of the number of cases with outcomes of interest after initiating a targeted drug to that before initiation. In addition,
SRs were adjusted (adjusted SR) for temporal trends in
medication and outcomes of interest using the method proposed by Hallas.13 The probability that targeted drugs were
prescribed first, in the absence of any causal relationship,
can be estimated using the so-called null-effect SR generated by the proposed model, which may be interpreted as a
reference value for the SR. Therefore, the null-effect SR is
the expected SR in the absence of any causal association
after accounting for incidence trends. The adjusted SR corrected for temporal trends can be obtained by dividing the
crude SR by the null-effect SR.

Signal Detection Via Sequence Symmetry
Analysis
Outcomes of interest were defined as osteoporosis diagnosis. Furthermore, bisphosphonate use was also defined as an
outcome because bisphosphonates are currently considered
first-line treatment options. All incident users of antipsychotics and newly diagnosed osteoporosis cases or bisphosphonate users from January 2005 to March 2017 were
identified. Incidence was defined as the first prescription of
the following antipsychotics: chlorpromazine (ATC code:
N05AA01), levomepromazine (N05AA02), perphenazine
(N05AB03), haloperidol (N05AD01), sulpiride (N05AL01),
olanzapine (N05AH03), quetiapine (N05AH04), risperidone (N05AX08), aripiprazole (N05AX12), paliperidone
(N05AX13), blonanserin, and perospirone. Target osteoporosis diagnosis was defined based on ICD-10 codes M80
and M81, whereas bisphosphonate use was defined based
on ATC codes M05BA for minodronate, M05BA01 for etidronate, M05BA04 for alendronate, M05BA06 for ibandronate, and N05BA07 for risedronate. The analysis was
restricted to those whose first prescription was administered
in July 2005 or later (after a run-in period of 6 months) to
exclude persistent medication users. Those whose first
osteoporosis diagnosis or bisphosphonate use occurred
within 12, 24, and 36 months (intervals) after initiating a
new antipsychotic treatment were identified. Patients who
had received their first antipsychotic treatment and whose
first osteoporosis diagnosis or bisphosphonate use were
within the same month were not included in determination
of the SR. The 95% CI for the adjusted SR was calculated
using a method for determining the exact CIs for binomial
distributions.14 Here, the lower limit of 95% CI of an
adjusted SR >1.0 indicated a significant signal, which suggested a potential association between the use of certain
targeted drugs and outcomes of interest.

Results
Disproportionality Analysis Using the FAERS
Database
A total of 8 576 118 drug–reaction pairs were obtained, with
4883 and 27 391 pairs being obtained for hyperprolactinemia and osteoporosis, respectively. Table 1 shows the
association between antipsychotics and hyperprolactinemia
or osteoporosis. All antipsychotics exhibited significant signals for hyperprolactinemia using both ROR and IC. On the
other hand, all antipsychotics showed no significant signals
for osteoporosis, except for perphenazine. The number of
drug–reaction pairs for blonanserin and perospirone were
fewer than that for other antipsychotics. The relationship
between perospirone and osteoporosis could be analyzed.
However, the relationship between blonanserin and osteoporosis could not be analyzed given the absence of cases.

Sequence Symmetry Analysis Using the JMDC
Claims Database
The characteristics of the antipsychotic users in the JMDC
claims database are summarized in Table S1 (available
online). Although slightly differing according to the type of
antipsychotic, users had a sex ratio of approximately 1:1
and a median age ranging from 33 to 49 years old. The characteristics of those who developed osteoporosis or used
bisphosphonate are presented in Table S2. The majority of
the patients who developed osteoporosis and used bisphosphonate were women with a median age of 56 and 60 years
old, respectively.
Table 2 shows the results of SSA. Accordingly, no association was observed between first-generation antipsychotic
use and osteoporosis, except for sulpiride use, which was
significantly associated with osteoporosis at the 24- and
36-month intervals. Moreover, no association was observed
between second-generation antipsychotic use and osteoporosis, except for aripiprazole, which was significantly associated with osteoporosis at the 36-month interval. On the
other hand, no association was observed between first- and
second-generation antipsychotic use and bisphosphonate
use.

Discussion
Although the onset of osteoporosis among patients with
schizophrenia has been recognized, the precise nature of the
association between antipsychotic use and osteoporosis
remains obscure.15 None of the antipsychotics indicated significant signals using all analyzed items (ROR, IC, and
adjusted SR; see Table 3 for a summary of our results).
DPA, but not SSA, revealed that perphenazine was significantly associated with osteoporosis. The reason why only

perphenazine exhibited a significant signal has remained
unclear. Nonetheless, perphenazine has been known to
increase serum prolactin levels.16 Indeed, the present study
showed that perphenazine as well as other antipsychotics
were significantly associated with hyperprolactinemia during
DPA, which suggested that antipsychotics were certainly able
to elevate serum prolactin levels. Prolactinoma, one of many
diseases known to induce significant upregulation in serum
prolactin levels, has been reported to cause hypogonadism
and osteoporosis.17-20 Although prolactinoma induces a significant elevation in serum prolactin levels (>100 ng/mL),
antipsychotic-induced hyperprolactinemia increases prolactin levels to only around 2 or 3 times the reference levels at
best,21 which may be insufficient to trigger the onset of
osteoporosis.
Interestingly, sulpiride displayed significant signals at the
24- and 36-month intervals in SSA. The percentage of incident sulpiride users with a diagnosis of schizophrenia was the
lowest among the other antipsychotic users (Table S1).
Sulpiride is often used for anorexia caused by depression in
Japan. Therefore, the characteristics of the patients receiving
sulpiride might have influenced the outcome of the SSA. A
significant association had also been observed between
aripiprazole and osteoporosis diagnosis during SSA, which is
considered a self-controlled approach that controls for timeconstant confounders. The present study set short-term intervals (ie, 12, 24, and 36 months) to investigate the association
between medication and onset of osteoporosis. Accordingly,
aripiprazole exhibited a significant signal only at the
36-month interval but not at the 12- and 24-month intervals,
suggesting that antipsychotic-induced osteoporosis might

occur after 3 or more years. However, this significant signal
for the onset of osteoporosis might not be related to hyperprolactinemia given that aripiprazole has been reported to
lower serum prolactin levels.22 On the other hand, schizophrenia itself may trigger the onset of osteoporosis. Indeed,
studies have shown that patients newly diagnosed with
schizophrenia had higher serum prolactin levels.23,24
Furthermore, lifestyle factors, such as smoking, reduced
physical activity, vitamin D deficiency, sedentary lifestyle,
and alcohol intake, which can decrease bone mineral density,
are implicated in schizophrenia.4 Nonetheless, the relative
contribution of antipsychotic-induced hyperprolactinemia
and lifestyle factors in schizophrenia remains elusive.
Although signal detection using DPA and SSA can be
useful for rapidly screening the risk of unknown adverse
events, they have several limitations. Reporting bias, as
well as the absence of a denominator and confounder adjustment, has been observed with DPA.6 Therefore, signals
derived using DPA in this study indicated an increased risk
for osteoporosis reporting. As such, DPA should only be
considered as exploratory in a context of signal detection
given that it does not allow quantiﬁcation of the true risk.25
On the other hand, SSA is affected by time-varying confounders and time trends in the occurrence of exposure or
outcome events.26 SSA can be regarded as a self-controlled
approach because of the comparison between postexposure
and pre-exposure follow-up. However, SSA does not
account for continued medication intake. In our case, the
continued medication intake of antipsychotics during the
intervals (12, 24, or 36 months) was not considered.

discontinuation of antipsychotic medication according to
the practice guideline of hyperprolactinemia.27 Our results
showed that among patients diagnosed with schizophrenia
(ICD-10 code: F20-F29), incident users of first-generation
antipsychotics were fewer (18.9%-59.7%) than incident
users of second-generation antipsychotics (Table S1). Such
antipsychotics might be used very briefly for diseases other
than schizophrenia, such as delirium and agitation.28,29 The
current study set osteoporosis as the outcome of interest. In
clinical settings, however, osteoporotic fractures have been
among the most clinically important. One study that investigated the risk of bone fracture associated with antipsychotics was recently reported.30 Thus, signal detection for
bone fractures, as well as osteoporosis, would be
beneficial.

Conclusion and Relevance
The present study showed no association between antipsychotic use and the onset of osteoporosis in real-world settings. However, some antipsychotics have long half-life and
are not persistently used but are used for emergency treatment in cases of psychosis at hospitals. These antipsychotic
medications were included in our analysis. For causality
assessment, further pharmacoepidemiological studies are
needed in consideration of these factors.
