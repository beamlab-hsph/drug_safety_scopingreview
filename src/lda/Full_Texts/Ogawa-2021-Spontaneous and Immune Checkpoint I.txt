Abstract
Background and Objective Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) such as programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4) inhibitors have greatly improved cancer treatment. However, they are associated
with immune-related adverse events, including autoimmune diseases (ADs) owing to their immune enhancement effect.
As there are few comprehensive studies of ADs by ICIs, it is necessary to analyze the period information of drug-induced
ADs. We also assumed that the temporal information may be useful to estimate the similarity of the pathogenic mechanism
between spontaneous and ICI-induced ADs.
Methods A period analysis including the Weibull analysis was performed on ICI-induced ADs using the Japanese Adverse
Drug Event Report (JADER) database. For evaluating the similarity of spontaneous and ICI-induced ADs, a hierarchical
cluster analysis was conducted to compare the different onset-time ranges.
Results Type 1 diabetes mellitus, autoimmune colitis, and pemphigoid occurred earlier with CTLA-4 inhibitors (median:
46, 29.5 and 28 days, respectively) than with PD-1 inhibitors (> 130 days). Myasthenia gravis had a median time to onset of
approximately 1 month, and the risk of onset would increase over time in ipilimumab combination therapy. This result reveals
ADs that require attention. Using cluster analysis, we estimated six clusters with different patterns of onset times. Based on
these results and a detailed previous research survey, the possible pathogenesis of drug-induced ADs was also discussed.
Conclusions This paper describes risk profiles with temporal information of ICI-induced ADs and proposes certain indicators for deciphering the mechanism of AD onset.

1 Introduction
Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), such as programmed
cell death protein 1 (PD-1) inhibitors and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4) inhibitors, have greatly
improved cancer treatment, and are used in patients who
are unresponsive to other treatments [1]. Although the
mechanisms of antitumor activity of PD-1 and CTLA-4
inhibitors are different, they are both based on immune
enhancement and work in a complementary manner.

Key Points
There are differences between programmed cell death
protein 1 (PD-1) and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4
(CTLA-4) in type 1 diabetes mellitus, autoimmune colitis,
and pemphigoid on the time to onset, and in myasthenia
gravis and type 1 diabetes mellitus on the risk of onset.
Attention should be paid to type 1 diabetes mellitus and
myasthenia gravis treated with combination therapy of
ipilimumab and nivolumab because they have an early
onset and an increased risk over time.
Similarity in the pathogenesis of spontaneous and druginduced autoimmune diseases was predicted by cluster
analysis using the time to onset.

Therefore, ipilimumab, a CTLA-4 inhibitor, is approved
for use in combination with nivolumab, a PD-1 inhibitor. Combination therapy has been reported to be more
effective than nivolumab monotherapy, in the treatment
of melanoma and renal cell carcinoma [2–4].
The mechanism of action of ICIs makes them effective against a broad spectrum of cancers, but they are also
responsible for immune-related adverse events (AEs) [5–8]
including the skin [9], endocrine [10], musculoskeletal
[11], and nervous [12] systems, and various other organs.
Previous studies have reported that endocrine AEs, pneumonia, and colitis are the most common immune-related
AEs [8, 13]. Otherwise, ICIs were known to induce various autoimmune diseases (ADs) [14–16]. The Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA) published
medical safety information about the risk of myasthenia
gravis (MG) [17]. Drug-induced ADs are usually uncommon but are noted as potential AEs on package inserts of
ICIs.
ADs affect approximately 5% of the world’s population
[18]. Some ADs such as MG, sclerosing cholangitis, and
ulcerative colitis are listed as orphan diseases by regulatory authorities. While it is known that they are strongly
associated with immune tolerance failure, the precise
mechanisms of most ADs are still unclear [19, 20]. Moreover, the age of onset varies greatly, depending on the type
of AD [18]. For instance, the common onset age of pemphigoid is over 60 years, while Guillain–Barré syndrome
and ulcerative colitis peak at 20–30 years of age, according to the Japan Intractable Diseases Information Center
[21]. However, the reason for these different ages of onset
remains unclear.
As in the case of spontaneous ADs, case reports suggest that there are differences in the time to onset of
drug-induced AD as well [22, 23]. A pharmacoepidemiologic study by Hasegawa et al. showed that the time to
onset varied depending on the type of immune-related
AE, including some drug-induced ADs [24]. Raschi
et al. summarized the pharmacoepidemiologic studies
on immune-related AEs and found that the median time
to onset depends on the type of immune-related AE, but
overall it occurs in 46 days [25]. While there have been
various reports about immune-related AEs, most reports
on drug-induced ADs were case reports. Therefore, a
comprehensive study on drug-induced ADs was desired.
We evaluated the risk of onset over time of ICI-induced
ADs by a period analysis using the Japanese Adverse Drug
Event Report (JADER) database published in PMDA. The
JADER database includes large-scale spontaneous reports
about AEs associated with the use of drugs and is used for
pharmacovigilance [24, 26, 27].
In view of the varied onset times both in spontaneous ADs and drug-induced ADs, we decided to compare

K. Ogawa et al.

the timing of spontaneous AD onset with drug-induced
AD onset, to predict the role of PD-1 and CTLA-4 in the
development of spontaneous ADs. In other words, if there
is less similarity in the onset time pattern of spontaneous ADs and drug-induced ADs, then spontaneous ADs
and drug-induced ADs are expected to occur in different
pathways, suggesting that the PD-1 or CTLA-4 pathways
are less involved in the development of spontaneous ADs.
Although the range of times to the onset of spontaneous
ADs and drug-induced ADs was different, a hierarchical
cluster analysis enabled the evaluation of any similarities
between spontaneous ADs and drug-induced ADs.
In this study, we focused on following ADs [MG, rheumatoid arthritis (RA), type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM),
aplasia pure red cell, autoimmune colitis, autoimmune
hemolytic anemia, autoimmune hepatitis, autoimmune
hyperthyroidism, autoimmune hypothyroidism, autoimmune myositis, autoimmune pancreatitis, glomerulonephritis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, hemophagocytic syndrome, immune-mediated thrombocytopenic purpura,
lupus erythematosus, pemphigoid, polymyalgia rheumatica, psoriasis, sarcoidosis, sclerosing cholangitis,
Sjogren syndrome, and Vogt–Koyanagi–Harada disease]
associated with three ICIs [PD-1 inhibitor: nivolumab,
pembrolizumab; CTLA-4 inhibitor: ipilimumab] that
has been passed at least 3 years since its release in Japan
(nivolumab, since July 2014; ipilimumab, since August
2015; pembrolizumab, since September 2016). To clarify
the temporal risk profile of drug-induced AD, we adopted
the Weibull analysis. The Weibull analysis is one of the
period analyses used to evaluate the change in risk of onset
over time [28]. We identified ADs that were highly associated with ICIs by signal detection using a reporting odds
ratio (ROR), and then calculated their median time to onset
and assessed their risk by the Weibull analysis. In addition,
the time to onset of spontaneous ADs and drug-induced
ADs was compared by using cluster analysis to elucidate
the PD-1 and CTLA-4 involvement in spontaneous ADs.
This paper describes the risk profile of drug-induced ADs,
and provides some clues to the mechanism of onset of
spontaneous ADs based on temporal information.

2 Methods
2.1 Preparation of the JADER Dataset
The JADER dataset, from April 2004 to January 2020, was
downloaded from the PMDA website [29]. The JADER
database is composed of four data tables: “demo” (including patient demographic information), “drug” (including
drug information), “react” (including information on AEs),
and “hist” (including information on the patients’ primary

617

Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor-Induced Autoimmune Diseases

disease). We extracted the data for “nivolumab,” “pembrolizumab,” and “ipilimumab” as the “suspected drug” in the
“drug” table. The cleaned “drug” table and “react” table
were combined by the patients’ identification numbers. Previous reports have indicated that there are duplicated data in
the spontaneous reporting database that could lead to inaccurate results [30]. There were several duplicated reports
of the same drug or same AEs in the same patients in the
dataset. Therefore, duplicated data with the same drugs and
AEs in the same patients were eliminated first (Fig. 1).

2.2 Definition of ADs
We defined ADs that were suspected to have a strong autoimmune involvement using the Medical Dictionary for
Regulatory Activities (MedDRA)/Japanese, Version 23.1
Standard MedDRA Queries (SMQ) [31]. The SMQ are
a comprehensive list of MedDRA terms for specific side
effects. First, AEs listed in the package inserts and interview
forms for nivolumab, pembrolizumab, and ipilimumab that
belonged to the MedDRA terms “immune-mediated/autoimmune disorders” (SMQ, 20000236) were extracted as ADs.
Next, the number of reports for each AD was investigated
with the cleaned JADER dataset. Because AEs with a small
number of reports are considered to be difficult to evaluate
accurately in a disproportionality analysis, ADs with more

ratio

than 50 cases in the whole dataset were targeted in this study.
All AEs and the unified Preferred Term (PT) list and their
number of cases are shown in Table 1 of the Electronic
Supplementary Material (ESM). In total, 23 ADs were analyzed in this study (MG, RA, T1DM, aplasia pure red cell,
autoimmune colitis, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, autoimmune hepatitis, autoimmune hyperthyroidism, autoimmune hypothyroidism, autoimmune myositis, autoimmune
pancreatitis, glomerulonephritis, Guillain-Barré syndrome,
hemophagocytic syndrome, immune-mediated thrombocytopenic purpura, lupus erythematosus, pemphigoid, polymyalgia rheumatica, psoriasis, sarcoidosis, sclerosing cholangitis,
Sjogren syndrome, and Vogt–Koyanagi–Harada disease).

2.3 Calculation of ROR
To evaluate the association between drug-induced ADs and
ICIs, we calculated the ROR with a 95% confidence interval (CI) [32]. In calculating the ROR, targeted cases were
defined as patients who reported the onset of ADs by each
ICI, while non-cases were defined as patients associated
with AEs caused by other drugs in the whole cleaned dataset. A ROR > 1 and a 95% CI range not including 1 indicated
a potential causal relationship; a ROR < 1 and a 95% CI
range not including 1 indicated the absence of a causal relationship; and a 95% CI range including 1 was considered to

be an invalid signal. The ROR and 95% CI were calculated
when there were more than three cases of interest.

2.4 Evaluation of Time to Onset of Drug‑Induced
ADs
Time to onset was calculated using “the date of AE occurrence” and “the date of drug therapy initiation” columns.
The time data were complicated because of multiple time
data due to repeated cessations of drug therapy. Additionally,
there were missing values in the database. To address these
problems, the most recent “the date of drug therapy initiation” for “the date of AE occurrence” was used for period
calculation. Because of the restricted number of reports on
ADs, data with only years and months were supplemented
with “15” as the date to make them available for analysis
[33]. Cases with completely missing values in time data
were excluded. If the same AEs were reported in the same
patient on multiple occasions, the first occurrence was used
for analysis. After data cleaning (Fig. 1), the median time
to onset was calculated where there were more than three
cases. The median times to onset of drug-induced ADs using
different ICIs were compared using Tukey’s test; the differences were considered to be significant if p < 0.05. Hsu’s
multiple comparisons with the best test was used to compare
drug-induced ADs for each drug; the test was conducted at
significance levels of 0.01 and 0.001.

2.5 Comparing Time to Onset of Spontaneous ADs
and Drug‑Induced ADs by Cluster Analysis
It is known that there is a wide range for the common onset
age of spontaneous ADs. Therefore, the data were collected
from journal articles, reviews, case reports, medical guidelines, and from the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare
study (see Table 2 of the ESM). As the age of onset of spontaneous ADs is dependent on ethnicity, we selected references for the cluster analysis following these conditions:
(1) the research was conducted in Japan; (2) age of onset
was presented as mean or median, and not a range; and (3)
the data were consistent with the age range reported in the
national survey. Previous studies have reported that the age
of onset of T1DM shows a bimodal distribution, with a large
peak for early onset [34, 35]. Therefore, we used the age of
early onset for the analysis of T1DM.
A hierarchical cluster analysis using Ward’s method was
carried out using common ages of spontaneous ADs and
the median time to onset of drug-induced ADs. Eleven ADs
with more than five reports of drug-induced onset for which
a reasonable age of spontaneous onset was available were
included in the cluster analysis.

K. Ogawa et al.

2.6 Weibull Analysis
Each drug-induced AD with more than five cases was classified by the Weibull analysis [28, 36]. The scale parameter
α and shape parameter β were calculated. α represents the
spread of the distribution of days to AD onset, with larger
values indicating a wider distribution. β represents the shape
of the distribution of days to AD onset, which reflects the
change in risk of AD onset over time. The onset patterns for
AEs were categorized based on the shape parameter β: when
β > 1, the risk of AE occurrence will increase over time
(increase group). When β < 1, the risk of AE occurrence
will decrease over time (decrease group). When β = 1 or the
95% CI is across 1, the risk of AE occurrence was estimated
to be constant over time, meaning that AEs occur at random
(random group). All analyses were performed using ­JMP®
Pro 15.1.0 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA).

3 Results
3.1 Overview of the JADER Dataset
The cleaned JADER dataset contained 607,842 reports from
January 2004 to January 2020. There were 7610, 4477, and
1701 cases associated with the use of nivolumab, pembrolizumab, and ipilimumab, respectively. A total of 1310
drug-induced ADs were reported including 800 (10.51%),
477 (10.65%), and 181 (10.64%) cases, related to the use of
nivolumab, pembrolizumab, and ipilimumab, respectively.
Of the 181 cases with ipilimumab, 79 received the drug in
combination with nivolumab. Out of 1310 cases, 64 cases
(4.9%) occurred with multiple ADs. The most frequent combinations of multiple ADs were T1DM and RA, T1DM and
autoimmune pancreatitis, and autoimmune colitis and autoimmune pancreatitis, each with three cases.

3.2 AD Signal Detection by Disproportionality
Analysis
High ROR signals were detected for MG (nivolumab:
34.69, pembrolizumab: 30.80, ipilimumab: 35.43), T1DM
(nivolumab: 43.21, pembrolizumab: 19.80, ipilimumab:
24.60), autoimmune hypothyroidism (nivolumab: 20.16,
pembrolizumab: 26.84, ipilimumab: 13.96), polymyalgia
rheumatica (nivolumab: 26.07, pembrolizumab: 17.57,
ipilimumab: 20.05), and Vogt–Koyanagi–Harada disease
(nivolumab: 41.85, pembrolizumab: 14.35, ipilimumab:
38.02, Table 1). In the case of sclerosing cholangitis, the
crude RORs for nivolumab and pembrolizumab were high
(nivolumab: 36.01, pembrolizumab: 56.71); however, only
two cases occurred with ipilimumab. Autoimmune pancreatitis showed similar results: the crude RORs for nivolumab

619

Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor-Induced Autoimmune Diseases

and pembrolizumab were 26.34 and 41.14, respectively,
while no cases were reported for ipilimumab. Overall,
most drug-induced ADs showed significant ROR signals,
except for Guillain-Barré syndrome and sarcoidosis caused
by nivolumab and aplasia pure red cell and glomerulonephritis caused by pembrolizumab, which exhibited no signals. There were only a few cases of lupus erythematosus
reported.

3.3 Period Analysis of ADs Induced by ICIs
The times to drug-induced AD onset are depicted in
Fig. 2, as median (interquartile range 25–75%, days). The
median time to onset was significantly longer for T1DM
[153 (76–270.5)] and pemphigoid [median: 154 (56–372)]
using nivolumab than for other drug-induced ADs. This was
also true with the use of pembrolizumab, for T1DM [136
(83.5–220.5)] and pemphigoid [176 (50.5–335)]. In contrast, MG had a significantly shorter time to onset compared
with other drug-induced ADs, with all ICIs [nivolumab:
28 (20.75–42.5); pembrolizumab: 29 (21–42.75); ipilimumab-nivolumab combination: 24 (18–34)]. Early onsets

were also observed in rheumatoid arthritis [nivolumab: 25
(12.5–139.5); pembrolizumab: 42 (8–107)].
Comparing the differences between ICIs, ipilimumab,
or the ipilimumab-nivolumab combination occurred earlier in most ADs than the PD-1 inhibitor monotherapy.
T1DM, autoimmune colitis, and pemphigoid showed an
earlier onset in patients treated with ipilimumab or an ipilimumab-nivolumab combination than in those who received
nivolumab or pembrolizumab [T1DM: 46 days (23.5–64.5)
in ipilimumab (vs nivolumab: p < 0.05), 63 days (57–88)
in the ipilimumab-nivolumab combination (vs nivolumab:
p < 0.05); autoimmune colitis: 29.5 days (9–46.75) and
pemphigoid: 28 days (7–76) in the ipilimumab-nivolumab
combination]. The exception was “Aplasia pure red cells”,
which occurred later with the combination of ipilimumab
and nivolumab than with the PD-1 inhibitor monotherapy;
however, only four cases were reported. The median time
to onset of sclerosing cholangitis with nivolumab and pembrolizumab differed by almost two-fold but had wide ranges
[sclerosing cholangitis: nivolumab 126 (31–226), pembrolizumab 62.5 (52.75–147.25)]. These results revealed that the
time to onset varies depending on the type of AD.

3.4 Classification of Drug‑Induced ADs
by Hierarchical Cluster Analysis

thrombocytopenic purpura, MG, and pemphigoid (ipilimumab combination therapy) [spontaneous AD onset:
45–70 years, drug-induced AD onset: 24–63 days].
Cluster 5 included sclerosing cholangitis, autoimmune
pancreatitis, and polymyalgia rheumatica induced by
nivolumab (spontaneous AD onset: 43.5–64.8 years,
drug-induced AD onset: 77–126 days). Cluster 6 included
autoimmune pancreatitis (pembrolizumab), and pemphigoid (nivolumab, pembrolizumab) [spontaneous AD onset:
64.8–70 years, drug-induced AD onset: 135–176 days].

A hierarchical cluster analysis was performed to generate a dendrogram for the estimation of classification into
six clusters (Fig. 3). Cluster 1 included T1DM (spontaneous AD onset: 11.6 years) induced by nivolumab
and pembrolizumab (drug-induced AD onset: 136–153
days). Cluster 2 included autoimmune hypothyroidism,
sclerosing cholangitis (pembrolizumab), and autoimmune
colitis (nivolumab and pembrolizumab) [spontaneous AD
onset: 26–43.5 years, drug-induced AD onset: 51.5–92.5
days]. Cluster 3 included T1DM and autoimmune colitis,
which were induced by ipilimumab or ipilimumab combination therapy (drug-induced AD onset: 29.5–63 days).
Cluster 4 included RA, autoimmune hepatitis, polymyalgia rheumatica (pembrolizumab), immune-mediated

The Weibull analysis was performed to evaluate the risk of
onset over time. We assigned the category [the risk of onset
will “increase”, “decrease”, or be “random”] to each AD
according to the results of the Weibull analysis (Table 2).

Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor-Induced Autoimmune Diseases

Fig. 3  Hierarchical cluster analysis of spontaneous (naturally-occuring) autoimmune diseases (n-ADs) and drug-induced ADs (di-AD) ref. reference

For T1DM, all treatments except ipilimumab monotherapy were classified as the “increase” group [β value (95%
CI): nivolumab: 1.20 (1.08–1.34), pembrolizumab: 1.43
(1.20–1.67), ipilimumab: 1.33 (0.69–2.21), ipilimumabnivolumab: 1.68 (1.17–2.27)]. In contrast, RA caused by
nivolumab was classified as “decrease” group [nivolumab:
0.69 (0.48–0.93), pembrolizumab: 0.77 (0.56–1.02)]. Pemphigoid was defined as the “random” group in all drugs,
with β values close to 1 and 95% CI ranges including
1 [nivolumab: 0.96 (0.70–1.24), pembrolizumab: 1.10
(0.81–1.45), ipilimumab-nivolumab: 1.23 (0.58–2.19)]. A
different category was assigned to each drug in MG. The
case using ipilimumab-nivolumab was classified as the
“increase” group while using nivolumab or pembrolizumab
were defined as the “random” group [nivolumab: 1.00
(0.83–1.18), pembrolizumab: 1.07 (0.88–1.28), ipilimumabnivolumab 3.11 (2.18–4.22)]. Although the number reported
for hemophagocytic syndrome was limited, the β parameter
of nivolumab and pembrolizumab suggested the “increase”
group [nivolumab: 1.52 (0.91–2.28), pembrolizumab: 1.52
(0.97–2.20)].

4 Discussion
Immune-related AEs due to ICIs are known to be common,
and most are reversible and of low severity [7]. However,
it is important to monitor their occurrence, as they could
cause temporary interruptions in cancer treatment. The
PMDA published recommendations for the appropriate use
of nivolumab, providing attention to its immune-related
AEs [37]. There were various references about immunerelated AEs induced by ICIs [8, 24, 38, 39]. However, there
were fewer studies focused on ICI-induced ADs. This study
focused on drug-induced ADs that are strongly associated
with autoimmunity. We selected 23 ADs that were indicated
on package inserts and analyzed their risk profiles over time
with a view to estimating the similarity/dissimilarity of the
onset mechanism of spontaneous ADs and drug-induced
ADs.
Overall, most of the differences were observed between
PD-1 inhibitors and CTLA-4 inhibitors. This may be
because of differences in their mechanisms of action. The
PD-1 inhibitor works during the effector phase to restore
the immune function of T cells that have been quiescent by

Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor-Induced Autoimmune Diseases

PD-L1. Meanwhile, CTLA-4 inhibitors work at the immune
priming phase by promoting the activation of naïve T cells
and reducing regulatory T-cell-mediated immunosuppression [40].
In the JADER database, 10.51%, 10.65%, and 10.64%
of all AEs caused by nivolumab, pembrolizumab, and ipilimumab, respectively, were drug-induced ADs. The proportion was almost the same in all drugs; however, a large
proportion of the data for ipilimumab was in combination
with nivolumab indicating slightly lower for ipilimumab
monotherapy than for the others. Previous studies reported
a higher incidence of immune-related AEs with CTLA-4
inhibitors than PD-1 inhibitors [7, 14]. While the exact
reason is unclear, it is possible that the drug-induced ADs
addressed in this study are regulated more strongly by PD-1
than by CTLA-4. This may be related to the wider distribution of PD-1 in the body [41, 42]. Shankar et al. reported
that immune-related AEs occurred in 24% of patients treated
with ICIs, with multiple immune-related AEs occurring in
approximately 40% of these patients [43]. In this study, 4.9%
of those who developed ADs had multiple coexisting ADs. It
appears that most drug-induced AD usually occur in a single
case. Although autoimmune pancreatitis was not reported in
large numbers, there were many cases of coexistence. Generally, autoimmune pancreatitis is known to have a high rate of
coexisting diseases. In spontaneous cases, 70% of patients
have concomitant diabetes [44]. ICI-induced autoimmune
pancreatitis was found to have high comorbidity as well as
a spontaneous onset. The most frequently reported druginduced AD in this study was T1DM for all ICIs. By contrast, lupus erythematosus was rarely reported. These results
suggest that PD-1 and CTLA-4 contribute more significantly
in some drug-induced ADs than in others.
Relatively high ROR signals (> 20) were detected in
T1DM, MG, polymyalgia rheumatica, and Vogt–Koyanagi–Harada disease with all ICIs, and in sclerosing cholangitis, autoimmune pancreatitis, and autoimmune hypothyroidism with nivolumab and pembrolizumab. Overall, most ADs
showed high ROR signals. Several ADs with fewer reports
such as lupus erythematosus and Guillain-Barré syndrome
did not show the significant ROR signals.
Ipilimumab was observed to cause an earlier onset of
drug-induced ADs than nivolumab or pembrolizumab. This
may be affected by the timing of the signaling mechanism,
which differs between PD-1 and CTLA-4 [40]. CTLA-4
stops potentially autoreactive T cells at the initial stage of
naive T cell activation, while PD-1 regulates activated T
cells at the later stage of an immune response [41]. Consequently, CTLA-4 inhibitors suppress the inhibitory pathway
earlier, leading to the rapid onset of ADs. This is consistent with in vivo experimental data: CTLA-4 knockout mice

623

exhibited ADs in early postnatal life [45], while PD-1 knockout mice exhibited them later [46].
In a hierarchical cluster analysis, ADs were classified
into six clusters, based on the times to onset of spontaneous
ADs and drug-induced ADs. Clusters 1 and 3 both included
T1DM. Cluster 3 is matched in timing with the early onset
of both drug-induced and spontaneous onset, while Cluster 1
is not. The common age of spontaneous onset of T1DM was
early in life [34], while PD-1 inhibitor-induced T1DM had a
longer time to onset (136–153 days). This implies that PD-1
inhibitor-induced T1DM occurs via a different pathway from
the spontaneous onset.
The median time to onset of T1DM differed between
PD-1 and CTLA-4 inhibitors (nivolumab: 153 days, pembrolizumab: 136 days, ipilimumab: 46 days, ipilimumab plus
nivolumab: 63 days). These results were consistent with previous reports [24, 47]. It seems to take a long time on PD-1
inhibitors for a common immune response [7, 16]. Unlike
CTLA-4, which limits the activation of naive T cells, PD-1
is known to be involved in the regulation of T cell exhaustion as well as suppressing activated T cells and inhibiting the activation of naive T cells. [16, 48]. Treatment with
PD-1 inhibitors causes deregulation of exhausted T cells and
induces the reactivation of exhausted T cells. Wiedeman
et al. reported that the slow progressive T1DM is associated
with exhaustion-like T cells [49], and this could also apply
to ICI-induced T1DM. These distinct mechanisms of PD-1
and CTLA-4 inhibitors may account for the differences in
the onset time of T1DM. In the Weibull analysis of T1DM,
ICIs except for ipilimumab monotherapy were classified as
the “increase” group, which requires caution because onset
risks will increase over time. Ansari et al. reported that the
PD-1 pathway regulates both the initiation and progression
of T1DM, while the CTLA-4 pathway is involved only in
the induction of disease [50]. Therefore, our results showing an increased risk of T1DM over time were in accordance with this report, which suggests a continuous progression of diabetes with PD-1 inhibitors. The β parameter of
ipilimumab monotherapy was 1.33, implying the “increase”
group. However, these data were based on only nine cases;
therefore, continued safety assessment is necessary for further elucidation.
Clusters 2, 5, and 6 exhibited correspondence in the timing between spontaneous and drug-induced onset. Cluster 2
accumulated five ADs, which were more prevalent in early to
middle age [51–53]. The time to onset of drug-induced ADs
had a range of 51.5–92.5 days, which was approximately the
overall median time for the onset of drug-induced ADs in
this study. Cluster 5 includes sclerosing cholangitis, autoimmune pancreatitis, and polymyalgia rheumatica, which
indicate a middle to late age for a spontaneous onset (43.5,

624

64.8 years) and drug-induced onset (77–126 days). Cluster 6
consisted of pemphigoid and autoimmune pancreatitis, both
of which showed late spontaneous and drug-induced onset.
It is possible that the mechanism of the drug-induced ADs
in these clusters may be similar to spontaneous ADs and be
facilitated by ICIs.
Autoimmune colitis in clusters 2 and 3 occurred at around
80 days (cluster 2: nivolumab and pembrolizumab) or 29.5
days (cluster 3: ipilimumab-nivolumab combination), and
was categorized as the “random” group. Autoimmune
colitis developed much earlier with ipilimumab combination therapy than with the PD-1 inhibitor monotherapy. A
large number of publications have reported that ipilimumab
is associated with a higher risk of colitis [8, 54]. Hu et al.
reported that ipilimumab monotherapy induced colitis with
a median time to onset of 64.21 days, which was longer than
our results of the ipilimumab and nivolumab combination
(29.5 days). Therefore, the combination of ipilimumab and
nivolumab may have further accelerated the development
of colitis by synergistic effects. In a previous study [24],
ICI-induced colitis was investigated with a broad definition, irrespective of autoimmune involvement. Comparing
the results, autoimmune colitis showed a later onset (median
onset of colitis vs autoimmune colitis; nivolumab: 74.0 vs
92.5, pembrolizumab: 62.0 vs 72.5).
Cluster 4 was the largest cluster that contained late-onset
spontaneous ADs (45–70 years) and early-onset druginduced ADs (24–63 days). Therefore, we can assume that
these drug-induced ADs have a different pathophysiology
than the spontaneous ADs.
The median time to onset of MG in cluster 4 was approximately within 30 days for all drugs. This was consistent
with the results of several reports [22, 24, 55]. MG is a
neuromuscular disorder, involving autoantibodies such as
acetylcholine antibodies and muscle-specific tyrosine kinase
(MuSK) antibodies. However, Makarious et al. reported that
MG caused by ICIs is not associated with acetylcholine antibodies [22, 56]. Another report has shown that there was
no increase in MuSK antibodies in ICI-induced MG [22].
Considering these facts, MG induced by ICIs occurs with a
different mechanism from that of spontaneously occurring
MG, resulting in early onset. This hypothesis is consistent
with the results of our cluster analysis. In the Weibull analysis, the high β parameter for ipilimumab combination therapy was shown for the first time in this study. This reflects
the importance of being attentive to early symptoms of MG
when using ipilimumab combination therapy, as they are
likely to appear early during treatment and the risk of onset
will increase over time.
PD-1 inhibitor-induced RA showed an early onset
(nivolumab: 25 days, pembrolizumab: 42 days), while spontaneous onset occurred at the age of 60–70 years [57]. Guo
et al. used gene signatures derived from patients with cancer

K. Ogawa et al.

treated with PD-1 inhibitors and found that the PD-1 pathway is a common molecular mechanism in both spontaneous
and nivolumab-induced RA [58]. Therefore, PD-1 inhibitors
may accelerate the onset of RA. Guo et al. also mentioned
that the PD-1 pathway is downregulated in the progression
of RA, which may be responsible for the “decrease” group,
indicating decreased risks of RA onset over time in this
study.
Several differences were found between nivolumab and
pembrolizumab. Sclerosing cholangitis, autoimmune pancreatitis, and polymyalgia rheumatica had different onset times
with the two drugs. Pembrolizumab-induced hypothyroidism
showed high β values compared with nivolumab-induced
hypothyroidism. Although the reasons for this outcome are
unclear, it is interesting to highlight the differences between
nivolumab and pembrolizumab.
It is also important to consider the limitations of the spontaneous reporting database and our analyses. While JADER
is a valuable research resource of pharmacoepidemiology,
it does have some limitations: (1) the total number of people who received the medication is not provided, hence the
incidence cannot be calculated; (2) spontaneous reporting
gives rise to information bias, as a result of over-reporting
and under-reporting; (3) because of less information on a
patient’s background, the possibility of confounding factors
cannot be excluded; and (4) the database contains missing
and duplicated data, which may bias the available data.
Therefore, we restricted targets to AEs of definite autoimmune origin to minimize bias and were cautious in the handling of data and the interpretation of results.
The Weibull analysis has been used in risk evaluations for
AEs [24, 59, 60]. Although the sample size for the Weibull
analysis is not defined, the variance increases when sample
sizes are small [61, 62]. As drug-induced ADs are rare, the
number of reported cases was limited. To the best of our
knowledge, the Weibull analysis can be conducted when at
least five data sets are available; therefore, we set a threshold
of more than five cases for this study [63]. Although results
should be interpreted with caution, the preliminary report of
drug-induced ADs is noteworthy because drug-induced ADs
are important AEs that require special attention.

5 Conclusions
This study revealed the timing of onset and the change in
risk of onset over time for various drug-induced ADs. As
a result, most of the differences were observed between
PD-1 inhibitors and CTLA-4 inhibitors. The combination
of nivolumab and ipilimumab is known to be highly effective, but we should pay attention to the patient’s condition because the combination therapy causes an earlier
onset for almost ADs. In addition, cautionary ADs with

Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor-Induced Autoimmune Diseases

an increased risk over time, such as T1DM and MG, have
been identified. We also predicted the similarities and
differences in the mechanisms of the onset of spontaneous ADs and drug-induced ADs by hierarchical clustering based on the onset times, then proposed a hypothesis
accounting for various studies. This analysis showed that
several ADs, such as MG, may have different mechanisms
between spontaneous and drug-induced onsets, and the
results were consistent with previous studies. This study
presented a temporal risk profile of drug-induced AD and
provided insight into the onset mechanism of AD from
temporal information.
