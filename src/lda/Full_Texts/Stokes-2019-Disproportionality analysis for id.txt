The Norwegian network of drug information centres (RELIS)
has developed a full-text, searchable question (Q)-answering
(A) database with nearly 50,000 Q/A pairs. The RELIS database is used to document decision support in complex clinical
cases provided by clinical pharmacologists and pharmacists
with written responses within a requested time frame [1, 2].
Selected Q/A pairs are published online in Norwegian on
www.relis.no as open access and are freely available to
healthcare professionals. Answers considered as not having
any general interest, or questions that are so specific there is
a risk the patient can be identified, are only available for the
RELIS staff. All Q/A pairs are indexed by the staff, and
searchable through selection of drugs (e.g., generic, ATCcode), categories (e.g., adverse effects, interactions), and text
words (e.g., dependency, misuse). The search function used
by the staff includes Boolean operators (e.g., AND/OR/NOT)
to allow combined searches [1, 2].
Thus reviews of the RELIS database can be used to identify
recurring problems in pharmacotherapy, drug safety, and poor
or inconsistent drug information.
Data mining algorithms (DMAs) are frequently used in
spontaneous reporting systems to uncover hidden relationships of potential clinical significance to drug safety. There
are several DMAs, but little empirical evidence for any preference or gold standard in pharmacovigilance [3]. Moreover,
missing data in spontaneous adverse drug reaction reports

(ADRs), and medical concepts that are fragmented across distinct terms, are challenging for statistical discovery. Thus,
DMAs in pharmacovigilance are only suited for hypothesis
generation, not for hypothesis testing [3, 4].
We wanted to study the feasibility of using the RELIS
database as a source for identifying potential drug safety signals by disproportionality analysis through a data mining algorithm (reporting odds ratio; ROR). The test drug,
quetiapine, has recently been associated with misuse and dependency [5–7]. Pregabalin was used as a positive control due
to several reports of association with misuse and dependency
[8–11]. Olanzapine was chosen as a negative control due to
our experience of lack of association in this context. Table 1
shows contingency tables for the respective drugs combined
with the category (adverse effects) AND text words (misuse
OR dependency).
ROR showed that quetiapine with misuse or dependency
occured twice as common compared with what would be expected if there were no statistical association between the drug
and the event. However, our database of spontaneous questions is not expressely fed with the purpose of assessing the
safety profile of drugs. Misuse or dependency in the Q/A pairs
could be unrelated to the drug in question, related to the medical history, or associated with other drugs used by a patient.
Re-use of previous answers could also be a bias, and a manual
examination of the selected Q/A pairs is warranted. However,
the questions in the Q/A pairs represent unique clinical narratives different from the more categorical and limited descriptions in ADRs. The answers include a problem-oriented evaluation based on a literature search in addition to a pharmacological assessment by the staff. The time period for selected Q/
A pairs in the RELIS database can also be described.
The possibility to process unstructured textual data like
ADRs, medical literature, electronic health records, and social
media is of current interest in pharmacovigilance [4]. We

database could be examined for new patient, drug, or treatment factors of relevance for hypothetical drug safety issues.
