ABSTRACT

ARTICLE HISTORY

Background: Baricitinib is approved for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The authors retro­
spectively investigated adverse events (AEs) by data-mining a self-reporting database to better under­
stand toxicities, especially since it has been used during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)
pandemic.
Methods: A reporting odds ratio (ROR) was used to detect the risk signals from the data in the US Food
and Drug Administration (FDA) adverse event reporting system database (FAERS). The definition relied
on system organ class (SOCs) and preferred terms (PTs) by the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory
Activities (MedDRA).
Results: The search retrieved 1,598 baricitinib-associated cases within the reporting period: 86 PTs with
significant disproportionality were retained. Infections including ‘herpes zoster,’ ‘oral herpes,’ and
‘herpes virus infection’ were found at a similar rate to those reported in trials, and such events were
rare. Reports emerged for several thrombotic adverse events, while these events were also rare.
Unexpected safety signals as opportunistic infections were detected. Serious outcomes as death and
life-threatening outcomes accounted for 9.76% of the reported cases.
Conclusions: The incidence of these AEs does not appear above the background expected. These data
are consistent with routine clinical observations and suggest the importance of pharmacovigilance.

1. Introduction
JAK-STAT (signal transducers and activators of transcription) sig­
naling is a target for inflammatory and immune-mediated dis­
eases [1] and inhibitors have been approved in various diseases,
including autoimmune diseases, myelofibrosis (MF), and poly­
cythemia vera (PV) [2,3]. While exerting immunosuppressive
activity, JAK inhibitors have been considered by some to increase
the risk of infectious complications. A meta-analysis suggested an
elevated risk of herpes zoster infection in patients with immunemediated diseases receiving JAK inhibitors [4]. JAK inhibitors may
be associated with and perhaps can also cause other side effects
as thrombotic events, cardiovascular toxicity, gastrointestinal
perforation, and malignancy. Regulatory agencies in Europe
and United States have added black box warning in manufac­
tures’ package insert of baricitinib regarding some of these.
The FAERS database is used for identifying potential asso­
ciation between drugs and adverse events in post-marketing
surveillance of drug safety, however, due to the self-reported
nature of the database there is a risk of bias. A FAERS analysis
of JAK inhibitors including ruxolitinib and tofacitinib focused

on the risk of thrombotic events [5]. Data are lacking regarding
the real-world safety of baricitinib. We assessed the AEs of
baricitinib by mining FAERS. In the present study, we retro­
spectively analyzed the AEs reported from the first quarter of
2018 to the first quarter of 2020 with baricitinib.

2. Patients and methods
2.1. Data source and collection
The aim of our study was to evaluate the safety of baricitinib
in the post-marketing setting. FAERS contains drug AE reports,
product quality complaints, and medication error reports. It is
designed to support the FDA’s post-marketing surveillance for
drug and therapeutic biologic products. Data from the FAERS
database were anonymized according to regulatory authori­
ties. The FDA publishes FAERS files every quarter (i.e., four files
each year). In our study, reports submitted between the first
quarter of 2018 (FDA approval of baricitinib) and the first
quarter of 2020 (the most recent update of the FAERS data­
base at the time the study was conducted) were extracted.

FAERS permits the reporting of arbitrary drug names, there­
fore, drug names were classified into generic name (bariciti­
nib) including trade name (Olumiant). All individual AEs based
on MedDRA SOC and PT level recorded on baricitinib reports
were identified to describe the spectrum of toxicities. Severe
outcomes included life-threatening events or those causing
hospitalization, disability, or death.

2.2. Statistical analysis
Our study is a case/non-case one, which can be viewed as
a case–control study. We analyzed AEs caused by investigating
drugs, but not by disease state. A disproportionality analysis
was performed using the ROR to detect spontaneous signals,
which were calculated using the case/non-case method, indi­
cating whether there is a signal for a potentially increased risk
of drug-related AE [6]. ‘Cases’ were defined as patients treated
with a drug who reported a specific AE, while all other possi­
ble pairs were ‘non-cases.’ The calculation for ROR using twoby-two contingency tables of reported event counts for spe­
cific drug and other drugs. ROR represents the odds that an
outcome will occur given a particular exposure and is
a measure of the degree of association between an exposure
to a drug and the odds of a specific outcome [7].
A ROR signal was defined positive when the number of
cases > 3, lower limit of 95% confidence interval (CI) > 1.0, ROR
value was > 2.0, and Chi-square values > 4 [8]. Unexpected AE
was defined as any significant AE discovered which was not
listed in the FDA drug labeling. All data processing and statis­
tical analyses were performed using R software (version 4.0.2).

3. Results
3.1. Descriptive results
During the study period (first quarter of 2018 and the first
quarter of 2020), a total of 3,422,047 reports were submitted
to FAERS. In total, 1598 reports on baricitinib were reported.
The clinical characteristics of events with baricitinib were
described in Table 1. Among all AEs, females (74.47%)
accounted for a larger proportion than males. Patients were
mainly aged > 60 years old, which was numerically older than
the median age of patients typically enrolled in clinical trials
[9]. Most of AEs were reported from United States (44.43%).
Baricitinib was the primary suspect (> 81%) in most reports.
Hospitalization (34.36%) was the most frequently reported
severe outcome. Death or life-threatening events occurred in
91 (5.69%) and 65 (4.07%) cases, respectively. Interestingly,
consumers represented the main source of reports in at least
half of cases (51.63%).

3.2. Signal values associated with baricitinib
The significant SOCs were ‘Infections (SOC: 10,021,881),’ and
‘hepatobiliary disorders’ (SOC: 10,019,805)” (Table 2). Significant
PTs of interest were shown in Table 3. Of note, ‘herpes zoster (PT:
10,019,974),’ ‘oral herpes (PT: 10,067,152),’ and ‘herpes virus
infection (PT: 10,019,973)’ were detected in data mining.
Thrombotic events have been reported in patients treated with

baricitinib, which are indicated in the label for baricitinib. In our
analysis, thrombosis as ‘pulmonary embolism (PT: 10,037,377),’
‘deep vein thrombosis (PT: 10,051,055),’ and ‘retinal artery occlu­
sion (PT: 10,038,827)’ were present, which correlated with find­
ings from clinical trials. However, unexpected AEs were
uncovered, including ‘pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PT:
10,073,755),’ and ‘nephritis (PT: 10,049,765).’ Both gastrointest­
inal perforation (PT: 10,018,001) and ‘neutropenia (PT:
10,029,354),’ which are listed in drug label, did not meet the
criteria for significant RORs.

4. Discussion
The spontaneous reporting system (SRS) has been utilized in
pharmacovigilance for safety assessment suspected AEs due
to inherent limitations of clinical trials such as stringent trial
design, strict enrollment criteria, relatively small sample size
and limited follow-up duration. Furthermore, study data from
clinical trials may not fit the real world where patients and comorbidities are heterogenous. Spontaneous reporting system
plays a major part in signal identification [10]. FDA has devel­
oped FAERS for post-marketing surveillance after a new drug
is approved to monitor the safety of drugs. FAERS is available
to the public with multiple access. Data mining of the FAERS
database would provide previously unknown drug-AE

associations and some well-established clinical ones [8]. In
general, AEs are under-reported in spontaneous reporting
systems [11]. Therefore, more than a single report is required
to generate a signal, depending on both quality of the infor­
mation and seriousness of the event.
JAK-STAT signaling pathways are activated by the binding
of an extracellular ligand to its receptor, which will lead to
phosphorylation of the receptors and JAKs [12]. There are four
members in JAK family, including JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, and tyr­
osine kinase (Tyk) 2. JAK inhibitors abrogate signaling from
multiple cytokines simultaneously and are approved in the

treatment of RA and other immune-mediated disorders.
Baricitinib, which selectively inhibits JAK1, JAK2 and, to
a lesser extent, Tyk2 and JAK3. Baricitinib prevents phosphor­
ylation of STAT3 and has been approved by the FDA for the
treatment of moderate to severe RA [13]. Various JAK inhibi­
tors are associated with slightly different toxicity profile; grow­
ing evidence suggests that JAK inhibitors may not be suitable
for patients at risk for infection and thromboembolic events
[14,15]. The differences in AE parameters between baricitinib
and other JAK inhibitor can be partially explained by the
different activities against JAK2 or JAK3. Since JAK3 is solely

expressed in lymphoid tissue, which makes JAK3 a target of
interest for treatments of autoimmune diseases [16].
Baricitinib, a JAK1/2 inhibitor, was discovered as a potential
anti-COVID-19 drug by artificial intelligence (AI) graph-based
research [17,18]. Preliminary clinical data has suggested both
its efficacy and safety in COVID-19 patients [19] but this awaits
confirmation in randomized studies.
Approximately 14,252 subjects have been enrolled into the
baricitinib clinical programs for RA, of whom approximately
10,034 subjects have received baricitinib. Cumulatively, it is
estimated that approximately 150,000 patients, representing
67,400 patient-years of exposure (PYE) have received bariciti­
nib from post-marketing sources worldwide. In our study, we
interrogated AEs for baricitinib, a JAK1/2 inhibitor, of its postmarketing safety. The most common and significant AE of
SOCs were ‘Infections and infestations’, which was correspond­
ing to previous safety data. Of note, baricitinib is associated
with herpes virus infection [20]. This is relevant as RA patients
already have an increased risk for herpes zoster compared to
the general population [21]. Unexpected safety signals such as
a case of Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia was detected in
our analysis. Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia is an opportu­
nistic infection, and has been previously reported with barici­
tinib use in clinical trials, but not in package insert.
Lymphopenia was detected with a signal strength of a ROR
of 3.31 (1.24–8.85), which correlated with findings from clinical

trials. Considering patients with COVID-19 frequently exhibit
lymphopenia [22], which is also a predictor of disease severity
[23], the use of baricitinib in COVID-19 patients requires once
again, randomized trials. There have been no cases of nephri­
tis reported associated with baricitinib in clinical trials; this
raises the question as to whether the report is accurate and
whether it was indeed related to baricitinib.
For thromboembolic events, the risk with 4 mg bariciti­
nib in patients with active RA in clinical trials are about ~5
cases per 1000 patient years, and the relatively small num­
ber of patients with thromboembolism means this level of
difference between groups has no statistical significance
[24]. The safety results of baricitinib with thrombotic events
suggested a class-wide event of JAK inhibitors [25,26].
Despite differences in selectivity between these inhibitors,
an overlap exists in their safety profiles. In our analysis, the
reported AEs were mainly from patients older than 60.
Recently, the EMA (European Medicines Agency) recom­
mended that patients older than 65 years of age should
be administered with tofacitinib only when there is no
alternative treatment due to an increased risk of infection
[27]. However, the risk of infection in patients older than
65 years old increased when treated with an immunomo­
dulator as well as placebo. Safety issues in this special
group of patients should be considered with their general
health status and their comorbidities as well.

The dose and duration of any treatment may clearly contri­
bute toxicity of a drug. The development of some toxicities needs
longer term treatment; thus, AEs and other potential risks must
be evaluated with different dosing durations with all JAK inhibi­
tors though when effective they tend to have rapid efficacy [28];
in COVID-19 patients the dosing is much lower than in autoim­
mune clinical trials [24]. Studies and regulatory bodies have con­
firmed 2 mg baricitinib has an acceptable safety profile over
a median exposure time of two-year [29]. As the use of baricitinib
for COVID-19 is of short-term, data are lacking regarding the risk
of AEs in this population. Another consideration is the dose of
baricitinib. A previous systemic review and meta-analysis indi­
cated there is no significant differences in AEs between baricitinib
2 mg and 4 mg at 12 weeks’ follow-up for patients with rheuma­
toid arthritis [30]. But FDA does not consider 4 mg baricitinib has
an acceptable safety profile. However, COVID-19 patients are far
different from patients with RA as is the immunopathology,
therefore, there are clear differences in these patients and the
AE profile may well be different.
The analysis of spontaneous reporting system is a useful
method for identifying possible signals, and the FAERS database
is considered as one of the largest sources of data. However, there
are limitations of our study. Firstly, FAERS database has missing
information and duplication of entries. We corrected mistakes in
the data entries and deleted duplicates manually. Secondly,
a slightly increased ROR value does not imply a risk of AEs in
clinical practice i.e. it may be correlative or associated. FDA does
not require that a causal relationship between a drug be proven,
and reports do not always contain enough detail to properly
evaluate an event. Therefore, the values only provide with safety
signals but not real risk. Thirdly, FAERS post-marketing data are
subject to many biases including severity and seriousness, so they
cannot ascertain causality and cannot be used to calculate the
incidence of an AE. Finally, many possible complications over
time, such as malignancy would occur anyway. It merits further
evaluation, particularly when the number of cases involved is
relatively small. Concerns should be raised with further evalua­
tion about a potential link with malignancy, as this data would
help evaluate the risk per type of malignancy and assess whether
the safety signals are drug dependent or a consequence due to
autoimmune disease itself. Despite these limitations, these data
can offer an update for medical staff to closely follow-up patients
administered with these agents.
In conclusion, the present study using the FAERS pharmacov­
igilance database suggested safety signals between the use of
baricitinib and an increased risk of infection and thrombotic
events. Unexpected AEs as opportunistic infections might also
occur. Since this study was based on a spontaneous reporting
database that inevitably contains potential biases, cohort studies
and long-term data are still needed to validate these results and
to further understand the safety profile of baricitinib.
