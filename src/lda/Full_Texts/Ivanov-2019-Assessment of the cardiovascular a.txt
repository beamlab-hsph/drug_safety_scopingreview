Adverse drug effects (ADEs) are one of the leading causes of death in developed countries
and are the main reason for drug recalls from the market, whereas the ADEs that are associated with action on the cardiovascular system are the most dangerous and widespread. The
treatment of human diseases often requires the intake of several drugs, which can lead to
undesirable drug-drug interactions (DDIs), thus causing an increase in the frequency and
severity of ADEs. An evaluation of DDI-induced ADEs is a nontrivial task and requires
numerous experimental and clinical studies. Therefore, we developed a computational
approach to assess the cardiovascular ADEs of DDIs. This approach is based on the combined analysis of spontaneous reports (SRs) and predicted drug-target interactions to estimate the five cardiovascular ADEs that are induced by DDIs, namely, myocardial infarction,
ischemic stroke, ventricular tachycardia, cardiac failure, and arterial hypertension. We
applied a method based on least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) logistic regression to SRs for the identification of interacting pairs of drugs causing corresponding
ADEs, as well as noninteracting pairs of drugs. As a result, five datasets containing, on average, 3100 potentially ADE-causing and non-ADE-causing drug pairs were created. The
obtained data, along with information on the interaction of drugs with 1553 human targets
predicted by PASS Targets software, were used to create five classification models using
the Random Forest method. The average area under the ROC curve of the obtained models, sensitivity, specificity and balanced accuracy were 0.837, 0.764, 0.754 and 0.759,
respectively. The predicted drug targets were also used to hypothesize the potential mechanisms of DDI-induced ventricular tachycardia for the top-scoring drug pairs. The created five
classification models can be used for the identification of drug combinations that are potentially the most or least dangerous for the cardiovascular system.

Computer assessment of the cardiovascular adverse effects of drug-drug interactions

Author summary
Assessment of adverse drug effects as well as the influence of drug-drug interactions on
their manifestation is a nontrivial task that requires numerous experimental and clinical
studies. We developed a computational approach for the prediction of adverse effects that
are induced by drug-drug interactions, which are based on a combined analysis of spontaneous reports and predicted drug-target interactions. Importantly, the approach requires
only structural formulas to predict adverse effects, and, therefore, may be applied for new,
insufficiently studied drugs. We applied the approach to predict five of the most important cardiovascular adverse effects, because they are the most dangerous and widespread.
These effects are myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, ventricular tachycardia, arterial
hypertension and cardiac failure. The accuracies of predictive models were relatively high,
in the range of 73–81%; therefore, as example, we performed a prediction of the five cardiovascular adverse effects for the large number of drug pairs and revealed the combinations that may potentially cause ventricular tachycardia along with potential molecular
mechanisms. We consider that the developed approach can be used for the identification
of pairwise drug combinations that are potentially the most or least dangerous for the cardiovascular system.

Introduction
Adverse drug effects (ADEs) are one of the top 10 causes of death in developed countries, are
one of the main reasons for stopping the development of new drug-candidates and are the
main reason for drug recalls from the market [1, 2]. Cardiovascular effects are some of the
most serious ADEs that may lead to hospitalization or death, and, at the same time, are widespread [1]. The ADE profile of a particular drug-candidate is usually investigated during standard preclinical animal tests and clinical trials according to the GLP and GCP requirements.
However, many rare, but serious, ADEs cannot be revealed by these studies, because of interspecies differences, the limited number of patients or animals and the duration of studies;
thus, additional in vitro and in silico methods for the detection of serious ADEs are currently
being developed [3–8]. These methods are based on the determination of the relationships
between several chemical and biological features of drugs and their ADEs. Among these features are molecular descriptors, known and predicted drug targets, gene expression changes
induced by drugs, phenotypic features such as perturbed pathways, or known ADEs. The relationships between these features and ADEs are usually established using various machine
learning methods and network-based approaches. It is accepted that the interaction with
human proteins is the most common cause of ADEs; therefore, known and predicted human
targets are the most common type of drug features that are used in corresponding studies.
Many of the developed methods require knowledge of only the structural formula of a drugcandidate to predict its potential ADEs; therefore, they can be used at the earliest stages of
drug development, which may sufficiently increase their effectiveness [3, 4, 8].
In real clinical practice, the treatment of human diseases often requires the administration
of several drugs, which can lead to drug-drug interactions (DDIs), thus causing an increase in
the frequency and severity of ADEs [9]. An evaluation of the effect of DDIs on the manifestation of ADEs is a nontrivial task and requires numerous preclinical and clinical studies. To
solve this problem various computational approaches for the prediction of DDIs were developed [10–22]. Most of these approaches are based on the calculation of similarities between
the profiles of various chemical and biological features of two drugs. These similarities can be

calculated based on molecular fingerprints, drug targets, their amino acid sequences, pathways
and Gene Ontology (http://www.geneontology.org/) annotations, the Anatomical Therapeutic
Chemical (ATC) Classification terms (https://www.whocc.no/atc_ddd_index/), as well as
known ADEs of individual drugs [10, 12, 13, 15–17, 18, 20, 22]. The Tanimoto coefficient is
the most common similarity that is measure in these studies; however, more complicated measures can be used, e.g., several approaches were developed to calculate the proximity of the
protein targets of two drugs in a protein-protein interaction network [12, 17]. Similarity measures based on the profiles of different features can be integrated into single interaction scores
that allow drug pairs to be ranked according to their potential ability to interact with each
other. To estimate the parameters of such integration and validation of obtained results, information about known DDIs was used. Such data can be obtained from various public databases,
including DrugBank (https://www.drugbank.ca/). For example, Cheng F. with colleagues [13]
used several machine learning methods with drug phenotypic, therapeutic, chemical and genomic similarities used as features to predict DDIs. The classifiers were trained on the set of
known DDIs from the DrugBank database and the same number of randomly chosen drug
pairs as the negative examples. The best result with the area under the ROC-curve (AUC) 0.67
was achieved using a support vector machine with a Gaussian radial basis function kernel. In
addition to approaches that are based on similarities, some other methods were developed [14,
19]. Zakharov A.V. with colleagues [19] used separate training sets of pairwise drug combinations for each of four isoforms of cytochromes P450, which are examples of known DDIs. The
corresponding information was obtained from the literature. Drug pairs were represented as
mixtures of compounds in ratio 1:1, and several types of molecular descriptors were generated
for them. The prediction models were generated by using the radial basis function self-consistent regression and a Random Forest. The balanced accuracies that were obtained from the
cross-validation procedure varied from 0.72 to 0.79, depending on the dataset [19]. Luo H.,
with colleagues, used the sums and differences of the docking scores for 611 human proteins
to describe 6328 drug pairs, which represented known DDIs from the DrugBank database, and
the same number of drug pairs was randomly chosen as a negative example. A predictive
model was created based on l2-regularized logistic regressions to obtain their values. The
obtained accuracy, sensitivity and specificity that were calculated based on the 10-fold crossvalidation procedure were 0.804, 0.847 and 0.772, respectively [14].
Despite the significant progress in predicting DDIs, all of these methods allow for estimating only the fact of interaction, but not the resulting ADEs, whereas such information is
important to assess the clinical significance of DDIs. The main problem is the absence of
known data for most of the DDI-induced ADEs. The major source of data on ADEs of individual drugs is drug labels [23]; however, they usually contain very few data on ADEs that are
induced by DDIs. Nevertheless, the corresponding information can be obtained through the
analysis of spontaneous reports (SRs) which are received by regulatory agencies from healthcare professionals and patients. Each SR contains information about all drugs that are prescribed to a patient, as well as information about developed ADEs. An analysis of large sets of
SRs allows for relationships between certain ADEs and individual drugs [24–29], or drug combinations [30–35], to be revealed. The datasets of individual drugs with information about
ADEs obtained by an analysis of SRs were earlier successfully used for the creation of predictive models that are based on structure-activity relationships [27, 29]. The corresponding
information on ADEs that is induced by pairwise drug combinations may also potentially be
used for this purpose.
We developed a computational approach for the assessment of cardiovascular ADEs of
DDIs. The approach is based on a combined analysis of SRs and predicted drug-target interactions (DTIs) and allows for the prediction of five cardiovascular ADEs of DDIs: myocardial

infarction, ischemic stroke, ventricular tachycardia, arterial hypertension and cardiac failure,
with balanced accuracies from 0.73 to 0.81. Unlike most of the other methods, our approach
requires only structural formulas to predict cardiovascular adverse effects for any pair of
drugs, and, therefore, may be applied for new, drug-like compounds that have not yet been
studied. The developed approach can be used for the identification of pairwise drug combinations that are potentially the most or least dangerous for the cardiovascular system.

Results and discussion
General description of the approach
We developed a new computational approach for the assessment of cardiovascular ADEs of
DDIs through a combined analysis of SRs and predicted DTIs (Fig 1).

Computer assessment of the cardiovascular adverse effects of drug-drug interactions

The approach is based on two main steps: creation of datasets on cardiovascular DDIinduced ADEs containing drug pairs that potentially cause or do not cause ADEs, and the creation of classification models for each dataset based on predicted drug targets as descriptors.
The creation of datasets is based on the analysis of SRs from the standardized version of publicly available parts of the FDA database [36]. The analysis was performed using least absolute
shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) logistic regression with the addition of propensity
scores as independent variables [35] (see Materials and Methods for details), which allows for
the identification of drug pairs that potentially cause or do not cause cardiovascular ADEs–
positive and negative examples. Each “positive” drug pair represents a potential synergistic or
additive effect of DDI on the development of ADEs. This method takes into account the confounding effects of other drugs and risk factors on the manifestation of ADEs and, thus, allows
for datasets with lower numbers of false positives to be obtained. To further improve the quality of datasets, information about the ADEs of individual drugs [37] was used to filter out
potentially false positive and false negative examples (see Materials and Methods). Since the
created datasets may still contain non-causal drug pair-ADE associations, we used an approach
based on inference scores (ISs) [38] derived from Comparative Toxicogenomics Database
(http://ctdbase.org/) to validate them and estimate their quality (see Materials and Methods).
At the second step of the approach, a PASS Targets software [39] was used to predict interactions of individual drugs that were from obtained datasets with 1553 human protein targets.
The sums and absolute values of the differences in the probability estimates of interaction with
targets were used as descriptors for drug pairs. The classification models were built using Random Forest along with a method that allows for the applicability domain to be determined.
The accuracy of prediction is estimated using a 5-fold cross-validation procedure (see Materials and Methods). To demonstrate the practical benefit of the obtained models, predictions of
ADEs for a large amount of drug pairs were performed. The analysis of the biological role of
predicted protein targets for the top predicted drug pairs that potentially cause ADEs allows
for proposing the potential mechanisms of corresponding DDIs.

Creation of datasets and their validation
At the first step of the proposed approach, we created five datasets of drug pairs that potentially
cause and do not cause five cardiovascular ADEs through the analysis of SRs (see Materials
and Methods), namely, ventricular tachycardia, myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, arterial
hypertension and cardiac failure (see S1 Table). Each positive drug pair represents an example
of a potential synergistic or additive DDI that causes a corresponding ADE. The datasets contain, on average, more than 3100 drug pairs belonging to 335 individual drugs and 166 ATC
terms (https://www.whocc.no/atc_ddd_index/) of the fourth level (Table 1), reflecting the
chemical/therapeutic/pharmacological subgroup of drugs, which indicates that the created
datasets are representative.
Since the datasets were created by analysis of SRs and were not confirmed experimentally,
they may still contain non-causal associations between drug pairs and ADEs. To validate

them, we used a method based on inference scores (ISs) [38] from Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (http://ctdbase.org/). ISs are calculated from known drug-gene-disease relationships and reflect the influence of drugs on disease manifestation (therapeutic or adverse
effect) (see Materials and Methods). We compared ISs for corresponding diseases between
drug pairs from created datasets, which potentially cause and do not cause cardiovascular
ADEs. We calculated AUC values for each dataset and p-values based on the Wilcoxon test to
estimate their statistical significance (Table 2).
The corresponding values range from 0.901 to 0.615 and reflect the quality of the datasets.
According to AUC values, the dataset for arterial hypertension has the best quality, whereas
the dataset for ischemic stroke has the worst quality. It is important to note that AUC values
reflect both errors in datasets, caused by disadvantages of the analysis of SRs, and errors of
approach, which was used for the calculation of corresponding ISs. Thus, the AUC values
reflecting the quality of datasets must really be higher.
According to the obtained results, we can conclude that the created datasets have from
good to moderate quality and can be used for further analysis.

Prediction of DDI-induced cardiovascular ADEs based on drug-target
interactions
We used Random Forest to create classification models based on five datasets and the local
(Tree) approach to determine their applicability domain [40]. The models were created based
on sums and absolute values of differences of probability estimates of interaction with 1553
human protein targets that had been calculated for individual drugs by PASS Targets software
[39]. The accuracy estimates were obtained by a 5-fold cross-validation procedure with use of
the “compound out” approach [41] (see Materials and Methods for details). The obtained average values of AUC, sensitivity, specificity and balanced accuracy were 0.837, 0.764, 0.754 and
0.759, respectively, whereas 95.7% of the drug pairs were in the applicability domain of the
models (Table 3). The accuracy values generally correlate with the AUC values obtained using
ISs (Table 2).

We also estimated the prediction accuracy of ventricular tachycardia and arterial hypertension on two external test sets, which are based on the data from the DrugBank database (see
Materials and Methods) (Table 4).
The obtained relatively high accuracies (Tables 3 and 4) allow for the application of the created models to solve practical tasks, e.g., to perform a search of new pairwise combinations of
drugs that potentially interact and cause cardiovascular ADEs.

Prediction of DDI-induced ADEs for the new drug pairs
The created datasets contain from hundreds to thousands of drug pairs that potentially cause
cardiovascular ADEs depending on the effect; however, the number of possible pairwise drug
combinations is much higher. To investigate the practical benefit of the created classification
models, we performed a prediction of the DDIs-induced ADEs for all of the possible drug
pairs that were generated from individual drugs with known data on five cardiovascular ADEs
(see Materials and Methods) [37]. Five large datasets were generated with more than 230000
drug pairs on average, and 190000 pairs (84%) of them were in the applicability domain of the
models (see Table 5).
Surprisingly, nearly half of the drug pairs in the datasets were predicted to cause corresponding DDI-induced ADEs. A large number of predicted drug pairs can be explained by a
prediction probability distribution (Fig 2). Most of the predicted drug pairs have probability
estimates are near the threshold P > 0.5, and they are unlikely to cause ADEs, whereas there
are near 2.6% of drug pairs potentially cause ADEs at probability threshold P > 0.8 (Table 5).
To roughly estimate the accuracy of predictions for large datasets, we calculated AUC values based on ISs from Comparative Toxicogenomics Database at different thresholds of probabilities (Fig 3).
Fig 3 demonstrates that the AUC values for most of ADEs increase with increasing the
probability threshold. The obtained AUC values at high probability thresholds are near the
corresponding values obtained on training sets (see Table 2). Thus, high probability thresholds
should be chosen for the selection of drug pairs potentially causing ADEs.
The results of these analyses and the results of 5-fold cross-validation (the average area
under the ROC curve, sensitivity, specificity and balanced accuracy were 0.837, 0.764, 0.754
and 0.759, respectively; see Table 3) indicate that the accuracy of the prediction of the most of
DDI-induced cardiovascular ADEs is relatively high and that the created models can be
applied in the search for new pairwise combinations of drugs that are the most or the least

dangerous for the cardiovascular system. Because DTIs are needed for the creation of models
that were predicted by PASS Targets software based on structures of drugs, the developed
models can be used for any drug-like compounds, including those for which only structural
formulas are known. For example, they can be used to predict DDI-induced ADEs for drug
candidates on the stage of clinical trials.

Assessment of the potential mechanisms of DDI-induced ADEs
Since DDI-induced ADEs are effectively estimated by using data on predicted DTIs, the corresponding information on drug targets may also be used to reveal the potential mechanisms of
cardiovascular ADEs and influence of DDIs on their manifestation.
We performed a corresponding analysis for the top 10 drug pairs from the large dataset
with the highest probability scores for ventricular tachycardia (Table 6). We selected only
those pairs where corresponding drugs do not cause ventricular tachycardia when administrated separately. According to prediction results, the drugs possibly cause ventricular tachycardia when they are administered together.
We found that the DDIs for these drug pairs may occur at both levels of pharmacokinetics
and pharmacodynamics. First, the drugs from five of ten pairs are metabolized by the same
cytochromes P450. Second, corresponding drugs potentially interact with protein targets to
influence the action potential of cardiac cells. These targets, either known or predicted, are
shown in Table 6.
It is important that only chlorphenamine and alfentanil were predicted to interact with the
HERG (KCNH2) potassium channel, which is a well-known protein that is associated with

ventricular tachycardia [5]. However, this and other drugs from selected pairs that are known
to or are predicted to interact with human proteins form compact fragments of the regulatory
network (Fig 4) and indirectly change the action potential. Such changes may form a basis for
the induction of ventricular tachycardia in predisposed patients.

Materials and methods
Data on cardiovascular ADEs of individual drugs
The data on cardiovascular ADEs of individual drugs were obtained from our previous study
[37]. Briefly, we created five datasets of individual drugs which cause and do not cause the following cardiovascular ADEs: ventricular tachycardia, myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke,
arterial hypertension, and cardiac failure. The primary source of information for the creation
of datasets was SIDER 4.1 (http://sideeffects.embl.de/), which contains data on ADEs of drugs
obtained from drug labels [23]. For each drug-ADE pair, we manually checked the section of
the drug label where the ADE was described. If it was described in “Boxed Warning” or
“Warnings and Precautions” sections, we considered that drug causes ADE. If ADE was
described in section “Adverse reactions,” which may contain effects unrelated to drug intake,
it had to be verified. To do this, additional information on ADEs was obtained using the following sources and approaches:

Computer assessment of the cardiovascular adverse effects of drug-drug interactions

• spontaneous reports (SRs) and electronic medical records. To identify potential relationships
between drugs and ADEs, disproportionality analysis was performed (see the publication
[37] for details);
• Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (http://ctdbase.org/) which contains information
about ADEs obtained from the literature.
We considered drug-ADE association from “Adverse reactions” section to be verified if it
was confirmed from at least one additional source. If ADE was not indicated in the drug labels
and publications although the compound had been used clinically for > 5 years and had > 50
SRs about other effects, then it was considered not to cause the corresponding effect. We proposed that integration of information from various sources allow filtering out most of false
positive and false negative drug-ADE associations from created datasets.

Assessment of DDI-induced ADEs through the analysis of SRs
In our current study, we used the AEOLUS database [36] as a source of SRs. AEOLUS is a
curated version of publicly available parts of the FDA database of SRs (https://www.fda.gov/
Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Surveillance/AdverseDrugEffects/default.
htm), where the names of ADEs, drugs and indications are standardized. We selected only
those SRs that contain description of drugs, ADEs and drug indications, because all of these
types of data are required for further analysis. A total of 4028051 SRs were selected. The ADEs
and indications in the database were described by the preferred terms (PTs) of the MedDRA
dictionary (https://www.meddra.org/). Since some PTs may describe pathologies that are
related to the same or similar ADEs, we selected the main PTs, which exactly match the investigated ADEs and supporting PTs, which are conditions that are similar to or are indirectly
related to ADEs. The main and supporting PTs for five investigated cardiovascular ADEs are
presented in Table 7.
At the next step, we selected those drugs in the AEOLUS database that have annotations on
five investigated cardiovascular ADEs: ventricular tachycardia, myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, arterial hypertension and cardiac failure. The data on drugs that caused and did
not cause five ADEs was obtained from our previous study [37] (see above). The following
numbers of drugs were selected: 496 drugs for ventricular tachycardia, 460 drugs for myocardial infarction, 447 drugs for ischemic stroke, 398 drugs for arterial hypertension, and 467
drugs for cardiac failure. The data on the five ADEs of these individual drugs are represented
in S2 Table.
We selected drug pairs that were formed by these drugs with at least 100 SRs wherein both
drugs are mentioned. For each pair of drugs and each PT from Table 7, we performed an analysis which is based on three steps. At the first step, we found which of the drug pairs are associated with selected PTs. At the second step we used LASSO logistical regression [35] to estimate
the potential synergistic and additive DDIs that are associated with the drug pairs that were
selected in step 1. At this step, noninteracting drug pairs were also determined. At the third
step, we integrated the obtained data on different PTs into single ADEs to create datasets with
positive and negative examples of DDI-induced ADEs (see Table 1).
Step 1. Identification of the association between drug pairs and PTs. A proportional
reporting ratio (PRR) was used to determine the drug pairs that are associated with each PT.
PRR is calculated as follows:
PRR ¼

The value A is a number of the SRs where both the drug pair and PT are mentioned; B is a
number of SRs where PT is mentioned, but the drug pair is not mentioned; C is a number of
SRs where the drug pair and other PTs are mentioned; and D is a number of SRs where the PT
and drug pair are not mentioned.
According to previously published criteria [26, 28], we considered a relationship between
the drug pair and PT if PRR � 2, A � 3 and chi-square � 4. The selected associations were
used at the next step of analysis.
Step 2. Identification of synergistic and additive DDIs. We identified synergistic and
additive pairwise DDIs that are associated with each PT by using LASSO logistic regression
with propensity scores (PSs). The method is described in detail in the original publication [35].
Briefly, PS is a conditional probability of being exposed to a drug that is calculated for each
SR. This probability depends on the patient’s diseases and, indirectly, on co-administered
drugs. The PS indirectly reflects the influence of human diseases and co-administered drugs
on the development of ADE, and, thus, allows for the filtering of many false positive drugADE associations. We calculated the PSs for each drug-SR pair based on the top 100 co-administered drugs and the top 100 most relevant drug indications. The relevance of co-administered
drugs and indications of a drug were measured by a phi correlation coefficient, which is a
square root of ratio of the corresponding chi-squared statistic to the total number of SRs [42].
The final values of the PSs were calculated by using the following logistic regression:

In formula (2), the values Ini and Drj are the indication and co-administered drug with relevance ranks i and j.

Computer assessment of the cardiovascular adverse effects of drug-drug interactions

Next, we used LASSO logistic regression to estimate the probability of PT for each SR that
depends on the presence of two drugs in SR, their possible interaction, and the corresponding
PSs as follows:
logitðPðPT ¼ 1ÞÞ ¼ b0 þ b1 PS1 þ b2 PS2 þ b3 Drug1 þ b4 Drug2 þ b5 Drug1 � Drug2 þ ljbj1 ð3Þ
In formula (3), PS1 and PS2 are PSs for drug1 and drug2, |β|1 is l1 norm of coefficients, and λ is
a tuning parameter of regularization. Parameter λ was determined through a 3-fold cross-validation procedure using all SRs. The potential synergistic and additive DDIs that are associated
with PTs were determined based on β3, β4 and β5 coefficients:
• synergistic DDI for drug pair-PT association was considered if β5 was more than 0;
• additive DDI for drug pair-PT association was considered if β5 equals 0, β3 and β4 were more
than 0, and drug1, drug2 have known links to the corresponding ADE in datasets from our
previous study [37].
• absence of DDI for the drug pair-PT association was considered if either β3 or β4 were less or
equal to 0, and β5 was less or equal to 0. Additionally, we considered the absence of DDIs if
the corresponding drug pair-PT association was not determined at step 1 (the condition
PRR � 2, A � 3 and chi-square � 4 was not true), but the drug pair itself was mentioned in
at least 500 SRs with other PTs. This threshold was chosen because it allows achieving the
highest accuracy of classification using predicted drug-target interactions as descriptors and
Random Forest.
Step 3. Integration of data on different PTs. To create final datasets with the information on DDI-induced ADEs, we integrated data on the PTs as follows:
• The drug pair was considered to be potentially “positive” according to the corresponding
ADE if it was linked to at least two main PTs, or at least to one main and one supporting PT
at step 2 of the analysis.
• The drug pair was considered to be potentially “negative” according to the corresponding
ADE if it was linked to neither of the PTs that are associated with this ADE. Additionally, we
removed from this category those drug pairs in which both drugs are ADE-causing, according to data from our previous study [37], as potentially false negatives.
As a result, datasets for the five cardiovascular ADEs were created (see Results and Discussion, Table 1).

Validation of datasets of drug pairs with information on five ADEs
Since the datasets on five cardiovascular ADEs were created using analysis of SRs, they may
still contain false positive and false negative associations between drug pairs and corresponding effects, thus, datasets have to be validated before performing further analysis. For this purpose we used inference scores (ISs) from Comparative Toxicogenomics Database [38]. ISs
were calculated based on known interactions of drugs with human genes which have links to
corresponding diseases in literature. ISs reflect the degree of similarity between drug–gene–
disease networks and a similar scale-free random network. The higher the score, the more
likely the inference network has atypical connectivity (see original publication [38] for details)
and the higher the probability of possible relationship between drug and disease. If drug is not
known to cause ADE according to data from our previous study (see above) [37] we took IS
from Comparative Toxicogenomics Database for corresponding disease; however if the drug is
known to cause ADE we took the maximal value of ISs among all drugs. It was done because

Computer assessment of the cardiovascular adverse effects of drug-drug interactions

many drugs, which have description of cardiovascular ADEs in “Boxed Warning” and “Warnings and Precautions” sections of drug labels, demonstrate low ISs due to insufficient information on target genes in literature. To describe pairs of drugs with corresponding ISs we used
sums of the scores of individual drugs. We calculated AUC values for each of the five datasets
based on ISs for corresponding diseases (ventricular tachycardia, myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, arterial hypertension and cardiac failure). We proposed that the values of AUC
reflect the quality of datasets.

Prediction of drug-target interactions
Interactions of individual drugs with human proteins were predicted by the PASS Targets software [39]. PASS (Prediction of Activity Spectra for Substances) [43–45] can be used for the
prediction of various types of biological activities and is associated with several hundred success stories of its practical application, with experimental confirmation of the prediction results
[45, 46]. It uses Multilevel Neighborhoods of Atoms (MNA) descriptors and the Bayesian
approach and is available as a desktop program as well as a freely available web service on the
Way2Drug platform (http://www.way2drug.com/PASSOnline/) [47]. PASS Targets is a special
version of PASS that is based on training data from the ChEMBL database (https://www.ebi.
ac.uk/chembl/) and allows for predicting interactions with 1553 human protein targets with an
average AUC 0.97 and a minimal AUC 0.85 [39]. The full list of human targets is presented in
S3 Table.
PASS provides two estimates of probabilities for each target of a chemical compound: The
Pa probability to interact with a target, and the Pi probability to not interact with a target. If a
compound has Pa > Pi, it can be considered as interacting with the target. The larger the Pa
and Pa−Pi values, the greater the probability of obtaining an activity against a target in the
experiment. In this study, we used a threshold Pa>0.3 for the estimation of protein targets of
drugs from the top 10 scored drug pairs potentially causing ventricular tachycardia (see the
last section of the Results and Discussion).
We used sums and absolute values of differences of Pa/(Pa+Pi) values, calculated by PASS
for individual drugs, to obtain corresponding values for pairs of drugs. Thus, each drug pair
was described by a vector of 3106 values, which were further used as descriptors for the creation of classification models (see below).

Creation of classification models for DDI-induced cardiovascular ADEs
Classification models for the prediction of five DDI-induced cardiovascular ADEs were created by the Random Forest method. We used the RandomForest function from “RandomForest” R package (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/randomForest/) for this purpose. All
arguments of this function were set to default. Since the training sets were imbalanced (see
Table 1) which is a problem for the creation of accurate classification models we used multiple
under-sampling procedure when majority class of the training set was randomly sampled up
to the size of the minority class. This process was repeated multiple times, and prediction probabilities from multiple models were averaged.
The applicability domain of the obtained models was determined by the local (Tree)
approach, which was described earlier [40].
The accuracy of created models was determined by a 5-fold cross validation procedure
according to the “compound out” approach, wherein each drug pair in the test set must contain at least one drug that is absent in all drug pairs of the training set [41].
The accuracies of the models for ventricular tachycardia and arterial hypertension were
also estimated on two external test sets generated based on information from DrugBank

(https://www.drugbank.ca/) database. The database contains some data on known DDIs that
lead to ventricular tachycardia (or prolongation of the QT interval on an electrocardiogram)
and arterial hypertension. These DDIs were extracted from drug labels and scientific publications by DrugBank team. We used this data as positive examples to create external tests sets.
To create negative examples, we randomly generated drug pairs in the amounts equal to positive examples. We did not include as negative examples those pairs, where both individual
drugs cause corresponding ADE according to data from our previous study [37] (see above),
as potentially false negatives.
