ABSTRACT
Purpose Adverse events (AEs) caused by polypharmacy have
recently become a clinical problem, and it is important to
monitor the safety profile of drug-drug interactions (DDIs).
Mining signals using the spontaneous reporting systems is a
very effective method for single drug-induced AE monitoring
as well as early detection of DDIs. The objective of this study
was to compare signal detection algorithms for DDIs based on
frequency statistical models.
Methods Five frequency statistical models: the Ω shrinkage
measure, additive (risk difference), multiplicative (risk ratio), combination risk ratio, and chi-square statistics models were compared using the Japanese Adverse Drug Event Report
(JADER) database as the spontaneous reporting system in
Japan. The drugs targeted for the survey are all registered
and classified as “suspect drugs” in JADER, and the AEs targeted for this study were the same as those in a previous study
on Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS).
Results Of 3924 pairs that reported SJS, the number of signals detected by the Ω shrinkage measure, additive, multiplicative,
combination risk ratio, and chi-square statistics models was 712,
3298, 2252, 739, and 1289 pairs, respectively. Among the five
models, the Ω shrinkage measure model showed the most conservative signal detection tendency.
Conclusion Specifically, caution should be exercised when
the number of reports is low because results differ depending
on the statistical models. This study will contribute to the

INTRODUCTION
Combination therapy increases not only medical costs but also
the incidence of adverse events (AEs). Drug-drug interactions
(DDIs) are generally considered one of the reasons for the
increased onset of AEs due to combination therapy. In premarketing randomized clinical trials, patients on combination
therapy are usually excluded because the focus is establishing
the safety and efficacy of single drugs and not investigating
DDIs.
Data mining algorithms for the quantitative detection of
signals have been developed for post-marketing safety monitoring. However, except for the extended information component
(extended IC) [1], multi gamma–Poisson shrinker (MGPS) [2,3], and
the regression-adjusted gamma–Poisson shrinkage (RGPS) [4], available algorithms only detect the signals of single drug-induced
AE, until recently.
From such a background, a number of statistical methods
for detecting DDI signals have been proposed [5,6]. Of them,
the extended IC, MGPS, and RGPS are algorithms based on
Bayesian statistical models, and their calculation is complicated compared with that of frequency statistical models.
Therefore, algorithms based on several frequency statistical
models [5–10] are expected to be exploited to detect potential
DDI signals.
Norén et al. proposed the Ω shrinkage measure model to calculate an observed-to-expected ratio as the statistical model for
disproportionality measurement of potential DDIs [7].
Thakrar et al. performed a retrospective study on spontaneous

reporting systems to compare the additive and multiplicative
models using known DDIs. Their study showed that the additive
model has sensitivity in detecting DDI signals, and the multiplicative model may further help qualify the strength of the signal
detected using the additive model [8]. Susuta et al. proposed the
combination risk ratio model as a risk assessment method for concomitant use of drugs at the frequency of two drugs reported
simultaneously, assuming that the possibility of a drug interaction is a combined risk in the occurrence of AEs [9]. Gosho
et al. proposed another statistical criterion as the chi-square
statistics model, which is based on chi-square statistics with Yates’s
correction, to detect the signals of the potential DDIs [10].
Previous studies investigated the detection tendency of signal detection models for single drug-induced AEs [11–15], but
not their detection tendency for signals of potential DDIs and,
therefore, there is no de facto standard for models that detect
DDI signals.
This study compared the signals detected using the following mining algorithm models: (A) Ω shrinkage measure, (B) additive
(risk difference), (C) multiplicative (risk ratio), (D) combination risk
ratio, and (E) chi-square statistics models, using the spontaneous
reporting system in Japan to clarify the commonality of
detection.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
The design of this study is based on a paper that discussed
trends in methods to detect drug-induced signals of already
disclosed single drug-induced AEs. In this study, we have investigated trends in a signal detection method for DDIs, using
the same database, targeted AE, and comparison method
used in previous studies [13].

quarter of 2004 to the fourth quarter of 2015. The JADER
consists of four comma-separated values (csv) files as data
tables: DEMO.csv (patient information), DRUG.csv (medicine information), HIST.csv (patient past history), and
REAC.csv (AE event information). In this study, we combined
these four tables and analyzed 374,327 cases.

Definitions of Adverse Drug Events
The drugs targeted for the survey are all registered and classified as “suspect drugs” in JADER. The AE targeted for this
study was Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), which was
extracted from JADER using the preferred term (PT) in the
Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities Japanese version
(MedDRA /J).

Statistical Models and Criterion
Ω Shrinkage Measure Model
The Ω shrinkage measure model [7] is based on a measure calculated as the ratio of the observed reporting ratio of the AE
associated with the combination of two drugs and its expected
value (Fig. 1).

Additive Model
Under the additive assumption, no interaction is established
when the excess risk associated with drug D1 in the absence of
drug D2 is the same as that associated with drug D1 in the presence of drug D2 (Fig. 2) [8]:

According to the multiplicative model and under the assumption
that the null hypothesis is true (i.e., no interaction), the proportion of an AE associated with the concomitant use of two
drugs (D1and D2) is the same as the product of proportional
risks of each individual drug in the absence of the other (Fig. 2)

Evaluation of Commonality of Signals Detected

and

The commonality of the signals detected by each statistical
model was evaluated using Cohen’s kappa coefficient (κ), proportionate agreement for positive rating (Ppositive), and proportionate agreement for
negative rating (Pnegative) as reported in a previous study [13].
The κ produces a ratio that adjusts the observed proportion
of agreement (Po) for what might be expected from chance
alone (Pe) and is defined as [13,16]:

P negative ¼

and

The Cohen’s kappa coefficient ranges between −1 and 1; when
the observed agreement is perfect or Po = 1 then κ = 1, when
the observed agreement is the same as that expected or Po = Pe
then κ = 0, and when Nyy = Nnn = 0 and Nyn = Nny = N../2 then
κ = −1.
The other 2 measures; Ppositive and Pnegative are defined, respectively, as:

P postive ¼

ð14Þ

Those quantities were used because no single method is
considered a “gold-standard” and using the κ, Ppostive, and
P negative in combination may be preferable in this case
[13,16]. In this study, based on the “rule of three [17]“that
was used empirically for early detection of AEs, the tendency
of signal detection for three or more reports was also
investigated.

Table 1 shows the fraction of the drug D1–drug D2–AE (SJS)
combinations for which the criterion for signal detection were
satisfied. Among all 374,327 cases analyzed, there were 3924
drug D1–drug D2–AE combinations. Furthermore, the number
of signals detected was 712, 3298, 2252, 739, and 1289 pairs
by the (A) Ω shrinkage measure, (B) additive, (C) multiplicative, (D)
combination risk ratio, and (E) chi-square statistics models,
respectively.
We divided sub-groups with counts of pairs of the drug D1–
drug D2–AE combination “n111” (Fig. 1) that were equal to 3, 4,
5, < 3, and > 5. The number of combinations for which no
signaling criterion could be calculated is also presented in
Table 1.
Table 2 shows values of κ, Ppostive and Pnegative between two
models of five frequency statistical models.
The statistical model with the most similar detection tendency to that of the Ω shrinkage measure model was the combination
risk ratio model (κ: 0.718, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.704–
0.733, Ppostive: 0.771, Pnegative: 0.948). However, when there
were ≥ 3 reports, the Ω shrinkage measure model showed the most
similar detection result to that of the chi-square statistics model (κ:
0.944, 95% CI: 0.934–0.954, Ppostive: 0.974, Pnegative: 0.969).
In contrast, the additive (κ: 0.081, 95%CI: 0.070–0.091,
Ppostive: 0.355, Pnegative: 0.326) and multiplicative (κ: 0.121,

showed little similarity to the Ω shrinkage measure model. The
additive model showed the most similarity to the multiplicative
model, but its κ (0.342, 95%CI: 0.326–0.359) was not high
(Ppostive: 0.791, Pnegative: 0.495).
The onset of allopurinol induced SJS is related to one type
of human leukocyte antigen (HLA), HLA-B*58:01 [18]. Here,
as an example of the detection result, some combinations
showing possibility of interactions is shown. Table 3 shows
the combinations that detected the signal with allopurinol
detected using the Ω shrinkage measure model.
These combinations showed an interaction in all methods,
except when the signal values could not be calculated. The

the additive model (AM): 0.26, the multiplicative model (MM):

Auranofin (Ω025: 1.22, AM: 0.76, MM: NA, CRR: 5.00, χ:

CRR: 3.53, χ: 2.26), colestimide (Ω025: 0.39, AM: 0.55, MM:
NA, CRR: 4.71, χ: 3.06).

Additionally, the signal value of allopurinol is PRR: 11.22
and the signal values of drug D2 (PRR) shown in Table 3 are
diclofenac sodium: 2.59, levothyroxine sodium hydrate: 2.56,
methylcobalamin: 4.11, pentoxyverine citrate: 19.29,
Auranofin: 13.87, epinastine hydrochloride: 4.47, sodium
azulene sulfonate hydrate, L-glutamine: 7.21, pranoprofen:
7.58, cimetidine: 3.91, colestimide: 6.60. Thus, all drugs
shown in Table 3 detect the signal of SJS even when used
alone. However, As can be seen from the results of the combination risk ratio model, the concomitant use with allopurinol
shows a larger signal value.

DISCUSSION
In this study, we evaluated the similarity of five frequency
statistical models [7–10] used to detect possible signals of potential DDIs based on data from a spontaneous reporting
system.
There were 3924 pairs of reported drug-drug combination-induced SJS in the spontaneous reporting system,
JADER. Among the five statistical models, most signals were
detected by the additive model with 3298 pairs (84.0% of the
total combinations), followed by the multiplicative model with
2252 pairs (57.4% of the total combination). In contrast, the
Ω shrinkage measure model detected the fewest signals with 712
pairs (18.1% of the total combination).
The five statistical models detected a total of 450 pairs
(63.2% were detected by the Ω shrinkage measure model). This

The similarity in the detection tendencies of the Ω shrinkage
measure and additive models showed κ, Ppostive, and Pnegative values of
0.081 (95%CI: 0.070–0.091), 0.355, and 0.326, respectively,
and these models showed little similarity. Additionally, the Ω
shrinkage measure and multiplicative models showed κ, Ppostive, and
Pnegative values of 0.121 (95%CI: 0.107–0.136), 0.364, and
0.614, respectively. Thus, there was a large difference in the
number of signals detected by the model. One of the causes of
this discrepancy was the difference in signal detection tendency when there were few reports. Among the 3298 pairs of
signals detected by the additive model, those detected when the
number of reports (n111) was <3 accounted for 2396 pairs
(72.7%). Similarly, among 2252 pairs of signals detected by
the multiplicative model, 1662 (73.8%) were detected when n111
was <3. However, with the Ω shrinkage measure model, only
19.0% of the signals were detected when n111 was <3.

When the n111 was ≥3 or more, the Ω shrinkage measure and
additive models showed κ, Ppostive, and Pnegative values of 0.360
(95%CI: 0.330–0.389), 0.779, and 0.513, respectively.
Furthermore, the κ, Ppostive, and Pnegative values for the Ω shrinkage
measure and multiplicative models were 0.507 (95%CI: 0.481–
0.534), 0.775, and 0.732, respectively and the similarity of
signal detection improved slightly.
Statistically, the reliability of the signal detected by the
combination with a few reports would be low. Considering
that the data is accumulated, not all signals detected when
there are <3 reports are false detections. However, < 3 reports
would be insufficient to determine that the signal detected by
the additive or multiplicative models are comparable to the detection tendency of the Ω shrinkage measure model.
The signal detection tendency of the chi-square statistics model
showed the most similarity to that of the Ω shrinkage measure
model, with the κ, Ppostive, and Pnegative values of 0.622 (95%CI:
0.601–0.637), 0.711, and 0.901, respectively. Furthermore,

κ, Ppostive, and Pnegative values of 0.944 (95%CI: 0.934–0.954),
0.974, and 0.969, and was greatly improved.
These results showed the same tendency as those reported
by the simulation study of Gosho et al., which compared the
chi-square statistics and Ω shrinkage measure models [10].
As an example of the detection result, Table 3 shows the
combinations that detected the signal with allopurinol

detected using the Ω shrinkage measure model. These combinations showed an interaction in all methods, except when the
signal values could not be calculated.
Although all drugs shown in Table 3 detect even when used
alone, the result of the combination risk ratio model revealed that
the concomitant use with allopurinol shows a larger signal
value. Since the combination risk ratio model is a comparison with
the signal value of a single drug, it is excellent in that the results

can be easily interpreted. The combination risk ratio model has the
disadvantage that no signal can be detected if <3 reports, but
if it is combined with other detection algorithms, it will be
possible to efficiently detect DDI signals that are easy to understand about the effects of concomitant drugs.
Studies on drug interactions with SJS as the targeted
AE are still under development, and there are many cases
that have not been reported. Therefore, among the examples shown in Table 3, the only one reported as a paper
was the combination of allopurinol and diclofenac sodium
[9,19].
However, all of the drugs listed in Table 3 detect the signals
of SJS when used alone. Furthermore, as can be seen from the
results of the combined risk ratio model, when used in combination of allopurinol with drugs listed in Table 3, a larger
signal value is shown, and it is considered that there is a possibility of drug interaction. These combinations will need further verification in the future.
Recently, the subset analysis was used to investigate the
effects of concomitant drugs using spontaneous reporting
system [20,21]. The subset analysis is simpler to calculate
than the five algorithms compared in this study because it
can take advantage of method for single drug-induced AE
monitoring. However, the signal obtained by this method
is not strictly DDI signal, but only indicates the effect of
the combination of drugs, as shown for the following two
reasons.
1. The subset analysis used in this study detects signals
from the target AE when a patient group taking drug
D1 takes drug D2. In all patient groups, when the signal
value of the target AE is large for drug D2, a signal is
detected regardless of whether or not the patient
group is using drug D1.
2. Target AE signal intensities when a patient group using
drug D1 takes drug D2 vs when a patient group using drug D2
takes drug D1 do not necessarily match. In other words, the
value to be adopted as the target AE signal value when
drug D1 and drug D2 are used concomitantly has not been
fixed (i.e. no clear detection criterion have been defined
for detecting DDI signals).
Although previous studies [20,21] have used animal
experiments and/or pharmacological data to ensure signal
reliability, this study needs to be verified only with statistical
reliability. Therefore, the subset analysis has been excluded
from the methods included in this comparative study.
However, because the subset analysis is computationally simple,
it might be possible to search for DDI signals more efficiently
when used in conjunction with the Ω-shrinkage measure model
that detected the most conservative signals identified in this
study.

LIMITATIONS
The signals obtained from the spontaneous reporting system
including the JADER used in this study included unknown
AEs that were also detected, which needs to be verified to
confirm they are true AEs. Furthermore, the information provided by the regulatory authorities did not include unknown
AEs and, therefore, there were no “real” true data for all AEs.
Therefore, because “real” true data cannot be used for verification in this study, it is only possible to compare detection
trends for each detection method.
This limitation, which is similar to that of previous
studies, suggests that it would be difficult to clarify whether the signal detection by the additive model is due to overestimation or the signal is underestimated using the Ω
shrinkage measure model.
Although it is usually important to compare detection
trends using all AEs recorded in a spontaneous reporting system, unfortunately, calculating signal values for all combinations of DDI would take a considerably long time, even if a
fast/powerful computer was used. Thus, doing so is not practical. Therefore, the same as previous study only SJS was set as
the target AE.
Signal detection algorithms are compared based on ratios
of the reported cases (N) to the expected value (E). That is,
differences in the number of cases registered in spontaneous
reporting systems such as JADER, Food and Drug
Administration Adverse Events Reporting System (FAERS),
EudraVigilance, Vigibase® and database of other regulatory
authorities should have a very small statistical impact in this
study. The verification about the number of registered cases in
the spontaneous reporting system is also reported by Caster
et al [22].
However, differences in the way regulatory authorities
think may result in a different tendency to register AEs to
the spontaneous reporting system. For example, FAERS has
also registered reports from non-medical professionals, but
JADER has not registered reports from patients until recently.
It is unknown how the differences in registration tendencies
affect the results of this study.
We don’t statistically believe that use of different reference
sets and spontaneous reporting systems will significantly
change the signal detection tendency, but it is also true that
we haven’t been able to verify all AEs and all spontaneous
reporting systems, as mentioned earlier. Namely, it is also
undeniable that, contrary to our consideration, the use of different reference sets and spontaneous reporting systems might
result in different performance characteristics shown in a previous comparative study [15].
For using the results of this study in pharmacovigilance, it is
important to understand that this study was performed under
limited conditions.

CONCLUSION
This study revealed signal similarities between data mining
algorithms based on frequency statistical models that have
not been compared in previous studies.
In the analysis which the targeted AE was only SJS, the
results clarified that the Ω shrinkage measure model detected the
most conservative signals. In addition, when the number of
reports increased, the chi-square statistics and combination risk ratio
models showed a similar detection tendency to that of the Ω
shrinkage measure model. In contrast, with the additive and the multiplicative models, fewer reports led to the detection of considerably more signals than that detected using the other models
and, therefore, care must be taken in interpreting the signals.
