Abstract
Objective: Case reports showing that proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs), omeprazole and
esomeprazole, can cause hypomagnesaemia have been accumulating since 2006. In this study,
the reports submitted to the Adverse Event Reporting System (AERS) of the US Food and
Drug Administration (FDA) were evaluated to assess omeprazole and esomeprazole in terms
of susceptibility to hypomagnesaemia.
Methods: After a revision of arbitrary drug names and the deletion of duplicated submissions, the reports involving omeprazole and esomeprazole were analyzed. Standardized official pharmacovigilance tools were used for the quantitative detection of a signal, i.e., an association between a drug and an adverse drug event, including the proportional reporting
ratio, the reporting odds ratio, the information component given by a Bayesian confidence
propagation neural network, and the empirical Bayes geometric mean.
Results: A total of 22,017,956 co-occurrences were found in 1,644,220 reports from 2004 to
2009, where a co-occurrence was a pair of a drug and an adverse drug event. In total, 818 and
743 adverse drug events were listed as omeprazole- and esomeprazole-associated, with
hypomagnesaemia ranking 85th and 135th, respectively. Although both PPIs were associated
with hypomagnesaemia, the statistical metrics suggested that the association was more
noteworthy for omeprazole.
Conclusion: The data obtained in this study do not provide sufficient evidence to recommend systematic monitoring of magnesium levels in plasma, but chronic exposure to a PPI can
lead to severe hypomagnesaemia.
Key words: adverse drug events, proton pump inhibitors, data mining, pharmacovigilance.

Introduction
In 2006, Epstein et al. reported that hypomagnesaemic hypoparathyroidism could be caused by
long-term use of a proton-pump inhibitor (PPI),

omeprazole [1]. Thereafter, case reports accumulated,
in which PPIs were shown to be associated with hypomagnesaemia [2-11], and in 2011, the US Food and

http://www.medsci.org

Int. J. Med. Sci. 2012, 9
Drug Administration (FDA) published a safety announcement that long-term use of PPIs can lead to
hypomagnesaemia [12]. Although recognized as a
rare side effect of PPIs, hypomagnesaemia is a serious
condition that can be complicated by life-threatening
arrhythmias and neurologic manifestations [10, 11].
Exactly how PPIs could cause hypomagnesaemia has
not been clarified, and controlled studies are required
to delineate the mechanisms [13]. Hypocalcaemia and
hypokalaemia are often documented as accompanying electrolyte disorders [10, 11]. Symptoms include
tetany, seizures, muscle cramps, vomiting, nausea,
and diarrhea, but these are not always found in patients with hypomagnesaemia [10, 11].
Most reports on PPI-induced hypomagnesaemia
concern omeprazole or esomeprazole, the S-isomer of
omeprazole, but the recurrence after substitution by
other PPIs suggests that this is a class effect commonly
found for PPIs. The present study was performed to
assess omeprazole and esomeprazole in terms of susceptibility to hypomagnesaemia, and to this end,
more than a million case reports on adverse drug
events submitted to the FDA database were reviewed.

Methods
Data sources
Input data for this study were taken from the
public release of the data in the FDA’s Adverse Event
Reporting System (AERS), which covers the period
from the first quarter of 2004 through the end of 2009.
The total number of reports used was 2,231,029. This
database relies on spontaneous reports of adverse
drug events by health professionals, consumers, and
manufacturers. The data structure of AERS is in compliance with international safety reporting guidance
ICH E2B issued by the International Conference on
Harmonisation, consisting of 7 data sets: patient demographic and administrative information (DEMO),
drug/biologic information (DRUG), adverse drug
events (REAC), patient outcomes (OUTC), report
sources (RPSR), drug therapy start and end dates
(THER), and indications for use/diagnosis (INDI).
The adverse drug events in REAC are coded using
preferred terms (PTs) in the Medical Dictionary for
Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) terminology.
MedDRA ver.13.0 was used in this study.
Prior to analysis, all drug names were unified
into generic names by a text-mining approach, because AERS permits the registering of arbitrary drug
names, including trade names and abbreviations.
Spelling errors were detected by a spell checker software, GNU Aspell, and carefully confirmed by

323
working pharmacists. The total number of errors was
223,239. Foods, beverages, treatments (e.g. X-ray radiation), and unspecified names (e.g. beta-blockers)
were omitted for this study, and the total number of
omissions was 164,384. Finally, duplicated reports
were deleted according to the FDA's recommendation
of adopting the most recent CASE number, resulting
in a reduction in the number of reports from 2,231,029
to 1,644,220. A total of 22,017,956 co-occurrences were
found in 1,644,220 reports, where a co-occurrence was
a pair of a drug and an adverse drug event.

Data mining
In pharmacovigilance analyses, data mining algorithms have been developed to identify an association between a drug and an adverse drug event or a
drug-associated adverse drug event as a signal that is
reported more frequently than expected by estimating
expected reporting frequencies on the basis of information on all drugs and all adverse drug events in a
database [14-20]. For example, the proportional reporting ratio (PRR) [14], the reporting odds ratio
(ROR) [15], the information component (IC) [16], and
the empirical Bayes geometric mean (EBGM) [17] are
widely used. Indeed, the PRR is currently used by the
UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory
Agency (MHRA), the ROR by the Netherlands Pharmacovigilance Centre, the IC by the World Health
Organization (WHO), and the EBGM by the FDA.
All of these algorithms extract decision rules for
signal detection and/or calculate scores to measure an
association between a drug and an adverse drug event
from a two-by-two frequency table of counts that involve the presence or absence of a particular drug and
a particular adverse drug event occurring in case reports. These algorithms, however, differ from one
another in that the PRR and ROR are frequentist
(non-Bayesian) ones, whereas the IC and EBGM are
Bayesian ones. In this section, only the scoring
thresholds used in the present study are given, and
the reader is referred to review articles for more extensive details of each statistical test [18-20].
In this section, we define how the association
between a drug and an adverse drug event is classified as a signal, when using each statistical test. Using
the PRR, a signal is detected if the count of
co-occurrences is 3 or more, and the PRR is 2 or more
with an associated χ2 value of 4 or more [14]. For the
ROR, a signal is detected if the lower bound of the
95% two-sided confidence interval of ROR exceeds 1
[15]. Signal detection using the IC is done using the
IC025 metric, a criterion indicating the lower bound of
the 95% two-sided confidence interval of the IC, and a
signal is detected if the IC025 value exceeds 0 [16].

Finally, the EB05 metric, a lower one-sided 95% confidence limit of EBGM [17], is used and a signal is
detected when EB05 is greater than or equal to the
threshold value 2. In this study, the adverse drug
events coded by PT numbers were listed as omeprazole- and esomeprazole-associated, when at least 1 of
4 indices met the criteria indicated above, and subsequently hypomagnesaemia was identified by the PT
code number 10021027.

Results
The total number of co-occurrences with
omeprazole and esomeprazole was 178,766 and
121,506, representing 0.812% and 0.552% of all
co-occurrences in the database, respectively. In total,
818 and 743 adverse drug events were listed as
omeprazole- and esomeprazole-associated with
55,904 and 48,481 co-occurrences, respectively.
Hypomagnesaemia ranked 85th among 818
omeprazole-associated adverse drug events, and 135th
among 743 for esomeprazole. The statistical data on
omeprazole- and esomeprazole-associated hypomagnesaemia are listed in Table 1. An association
with hypomagnesaemia was suggested for both PPIs,
but the association was more noteworthy for
omeprazole.

Discussion
Magnesium is an essential factor implicated in
many biochemical and physiological processes, and
its homeostasis is sophisticatedly regulated by intes-

tinal absorption, renal excretion and other systems in
the body [10, 11]. Hypomagnesaemia or hypermagnesaemia may arise from various types of
disorders [10, 11]. In 2006, a report was published by
Epstein et al., in which a PPI, omeprazole, was shown
to be associated with hypomagnesaemia [1]. To date,
about 10 case reports have been published with respect to PPI-associated hypomagnesaemia [2-9], and
their findings can be summarized as; 1) PPI long-term
use was observed in patients with hypomagnesaemia,
2) symptoms did not occur until plasma concentrations were less than 0.5 mmol/L, 3) mechanisms by
which the hypomagnesaemia occurred under PPI
therapy remain unclear, 4) hypokalaemia often accompanied the hypomagnesaemia, 5) hypocalcaemia
also frequently developed via impairment of parathyroid hormone secretion, 6) oral or parenteral supplement of magnesium was effective for temporary
relief from symptoms, but unable to correct the plasma concentration of magnesium, and 7) withdrawal of
PPI allowed to resolve the hypomagnesaemia [10, 11].
Hypomagnesaemia is understood to be a rare side
effect of PPIs, but Epstein et al. speculated that the
cases represented the tip of an iceberg [1]. Hypomagnesaemia might be underdiagnosed, in part, due
to the relatively low frequency of magnesium measurements in routine clinical analysis. If hypomagnesaemia is found in PPI users, it might be attributed
to co-administered diuretics or other nephrotoxic
drugs. It is important to perform clinical studies to
clarify the true prevalence and risk factors, and to
clarify the mechanisms by which hypomagnesaemia
develops.

To date, most case reports on PPI-associated
hypomagnesaemia
concern
omeprazole
or
esomeprazole, but hypomagnesaemia is understood
to be common for PPIs. Broeren et al. showed that
hypomagnesaemia was resolved after the replacement of omeprazole with a H2-blocker, ranitidine, but
the re-replacement of ranitidine with pantoprazole
resulted in recurrence [5]. The same fluctuation was
found for lansoprazole [5]. Hoorn et al. reported a
case of hypomagnesaemia in which the patient was
treated with pantoprazole [8]. They also documented
another case in which the replacement of omeprazole
with rabeprazole resulted in a further decrease in serum levels of magnesium [8]. In this study, using
1,644,220 reports from 2004 to 2009, it was suggested
that hypomagnesaemia was associated with omeprazole and esomeprazole, and was more noteworthy for
omeprazole, suggesting the usefulness of the AERS
database and official pharmacovigilance tools. Although pantoprazole, lansoprazole and rabeprazole
were also analyzed, the numbers of co-occurrences
were not large enough to detect signals. The first
clinical report on PPI-associated hypomagnesaemia
appeared in late 2006, which was on omeprazole and
esomeprazole, and the PPI-associated hypomagnesaemia entered clinical consciousness slowly. The
AERS data used in this study were those from 2004 to
2009, and the latest data should be used to assess the
associations with pantoprazole, lansoprazole and
rabeprazole.
The AERS database is considered a valuable tool;
however, some limitations inherent to spontaneous
reporting have been pointed out [18]. First, the data
occasionally contain misspelling and miswords, although the structure of AERS is in compliance with the
international safety reporting guidance. Second, the
system was started more than 10 years ago, and reporting patterns have changed over time. Third, the
adverse events are coded using hierarchical terms of
PTs of MedDRA, and changes in terminology over
time also might affect the quality of the database. Last,
there are a number of duplicate entries in the database. To overcome problems with data quality, we
manually corrected mistakes in the data entities and
deleted duplicates according to FDA’s recommended
method, resulting in the development of a novel system to analyze an association between a drug and an
adverse drug event. Previously, this system has been
used to assess adverse drug events accompanying the
use of platinum agents [21]. The data obtained was
consistent with clinical observations, suggesting the
usefulness of the system [21]. Additionally, this system was used to evaluate susceptibility to hypersensitivity reactions for 14 anticancer agents, and it was

325
found that the number of co-occurrences was an important factor in signal detection [22, 23]. Very recently, this system was applied to the evaluation of
adverse drug events induced by statins [24], capecitabine [25] and tigecycline [26], and again the reproducibility of clinical observations was suggested,
providing that the number of co-occurrences was
large enough to detect a signal.
It should be noted that there is no credible
counterfactual means, e.g., a randomized control
group, to identify an association between a drug and
an adverse drug event as a signal, and therefore disease-oriented adverse events can be extracted as signals. For example, hypomagnesaemia was extracted
as an omeprazole-associated adverse drug event, but
might be common in patients with acid peptic disorders irrespective of the administration of PPIs. Generally, the results obtained using this system can be
biased by unmeasured confounding factors, and
flawed by incomplete data; however, a comparison
among PPIs possibly offsets them, resulting in a
rank-order of association according to the statistical
metrics. In conclusion, the data obtained in this study
do not provide sufficient evidence to recommend
systematic monitoring of magnesium levels in plasma, but chronic exposure to a PPI can lead to severe
hypomagnesaemia.
