Background

Editor: Maya Williams, Naval Medical Research
Center, UNITED STATES

To assess adverse events (AEs) after HDCV reported to the US Vaccine Adverse Event
Reporting System (VAERS), a spontaneous reporting surveillance system.

In 1980, human diploid cell vaccine (HDCV, Imovax Rabies, Sanofi Pasteur), was licensed
for use in the United States.

Methods

Published: July 13, 2016

We searched VAERS for US reports after HDCV among persons vaccinated from January
1, 1990–July 31, 2015. Medical records were requested for reports classified as serious
(death, hospitalization, prolonged hospitalization, disability, life-threatening-illness), and
those suggesting anaphylaxis and Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS). Physicians reviewed
available information and assigned a primary clinical category to each report using MedDRA system organ classes. Empirical Bayesian (EB) data mining was used to identify disproportional AE reporting after HDCV.

Results
VAERS received 1,611 reports after HDCV; 93 (5.8%) were serious. Among all reports,
the three most common AEs included pyrexia (18.2%), headache (17.9%), and nausea
(16.5%). Among serious reports, four deaths appeared to be unrelated to vaccination.

Conclusions
This 25-year review of VAERS did not identify new or unexpected AEs after HDCV. The
vast majority of AEs were non-serious. Injection site reactions, hypersensitivity reactions,
and non-specific constitutional symptoms were most frequently reported, similar to findings
in pre-licensure studies.

Author Summary
In 1980, human diploid cell rabies vaccine (HDCV, Imovax Rabies, Sanofi Pasteur), was
licensed for use in the United States. To assess adverse events (AEs) after HDCV reported

Introduction
Three cell culture rabies vaccines are licensed in the United States: human diploid cell vaccine
(HDCV, Imovax Rabies, Sanofi Pasteur), purified chick embryo cell vaccine (PCECV, RabAvert, Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics), and rabies vaccine adsorbed (RVA, Bioport Corporation). Only HDCV and PCECV are available for use in the United States [1]. These vaccines
are indicated for post- and pre-exposure prophylaxis to prevent human rabies [1,2,3,5]. Rabies
post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) involves prompt and thorough wound cleansing followed by
passive immunization with human rabies immunoglobulins (HRIG) and vaccination with four
doses of HDCV or PCECV (given in a series separated by several days) for persons previously
unvaccinated with rabies vaccine (five doses in persons with altered immunocompetence). Persons who previously received a complete vaccination series (pre-exposure or postexposure)
should receive only two doses of vaccine. Pre-exposure vaccination, with three doses of either
vaccine given for a primary course, is recommended for persons in high-risk groups such as
veterinarians and their staff, animal handlers, rabies researchers, and certain laboratory workers. Pre-exposure vaccination should also be considered in persons (e.g., international travelers) who are likely to come in contact with rabid animals in areas or countries where dog or
other animal rabies is enzootic and immediate access to appropriate medical care, including
rabies vaccine and immune globulin, might be limited [1,2]. Serologic monitoring of vaccinated

persons in the highest risk groups is recommended with a single booster dose of vaccine given
if the serum titer falls below the recommended cut off. PCECV became available in 1997 [3]
and a safety assessment of VAERS reports during 1997–2005 was conducted in 2006 [4].
HDCV, which was licensed on June 9, 1980, is prepared from the Pitman-Moore strain of
rabies virus grown on MRC-5 human diploid cell culture [5]. In pre-licensure studies of
HDCV, local reactions (e.g., pain at the injection site, redness, swelling, and induration) were
the most common adverse events (AEs) following vaccination [1], affecting approximately
25% of recipients [5]. Mild constitutional symptoms (e.g., fever, headache, dizziness, and gastrointestinal symptoms) were observed in 20–56% of recipients [1,5]. In one study, up to 6% of
persons presented with systemic hypersensitivity reactions after receiving booster vaccination
with HDCV following primary rabies prophylaxis, 3% occurring within 1 day of receiving
boosters, and 3% occurring 6–14 days after boosters [1,7]. Post-marketing reports of hypersensitivity reactions after HDCV have previously been reviewed [6], but this is the first summary
of all AEs reported to VAERS since product licensure more than 30 years ago. In the present
study, we assess the safety of HDCV from the inception of VAERS through July 31, 2015.

Materials and Methods
Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS)
Established in 1990, VAERS is a national vaccine safety surveillance system, co-administered
by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) that receives spontaneous reports (also known as passive surveillance) of AEs following
immunization [8]. Anyone can report and adverse event (AE) including healthcare providers,
vaccine recipients, vaccine manufacturers, and other reporters. Reports are submitted voluntarily either directly from individual reporters, who may be reporting for themselves or others,
or secondarily from vaccine manufacturers, that also receive spontaneous reports and in turn
submit them to VAERS. Reporting is encouraged for any clinically important or unexpected
AE, even if the reporter is not sure if a vaccine caused the event [8]. VAERS accepts all reports
without rendering judgment on clinical importance or whether vaccine(s) might have caused
the AE. The VAERS report form collects information on age, sex, vaccine(s) administered, AE
(s) experienced, medical conditions at the time of vaccination, and medical history. Signs and
symptoms of AEs are coded by trained personnel and entered into a database using the Medical
Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA), a clinically validated, internationally standardized medical terminology [9]. A VAERS report may be assigned one or more MedDRA
preferred terms (PT). A PT is a distinct descriptor for a symptom, sign, disease, diagnosis, therapeutic indication, investigation, surgical, or medical procedure, and medical, social, or family
history characteristic [10]. MedDRA PTs are not confirmed diagnoses. Reports are classified as
serious based on the Code of Federal Regulations if one of the following is reported: death, lifethreatening illness, hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization, permanent disability, or
a congenital anomaly [11]. For serious reports from sources other than vaccine manufacturers,
medical records are routinely requested and made available to VAERS personnel. Reports
of medication errors (e.g., drug administered to patient of inappropriate age) may also be
reported and are assigned MedDRA PTs, even if there is no AE per se.
We analyzed US VAERS reports received by July 31, 2015 for persons vaccinated with
HDCV during January 1, 1990 through July 31, 2015. We excluded non-US reports and duplicate reports. All patient medical data was anonymized. Because VAERS is a routine surveillance program conducted for public health, it does not meet the definition of research and is
not subject to Institutional Review Board approval and informed consent requirements.

Clinical review of reports
Physicians reviewed all reports and all available medical records for serious reports and the following conditions (regardless of seriousness): anaphylaxis, Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS),
and pregnancy. The main diagnosis was categorized into a MedDRA System Organ Class
(SOC) group. Reports suggestive of anaphylaxis or GBS were verified using the Brighton Collaboration criteria or a physician’s diagnosis [12,13].

Data mining
We used Empirical Bayesian (EB) data mining [14] to identify AEs reported more frequently
than expected following HDCV in the VAERS database. EB data mining screens for vaccineevent pairs that are reported more frequently than expected, i.e. disproportional reporting. Furthermore, EB data mining can minimize false-positive signals resulting from the algorithm’s
shrinkage towards the null when observed and/or expected counts are low. EB05 is defined as
the lower 90% CI limit of the adjusted ratios of the observed counts over expected counts [15].
Through data-mining analysis, HDCV reports were compared with all other vaccines in the
VAERS database. We used published criteria [15,16] to identify, with a high degree of confidence, HDCV vaccine-event pairs reported at least twice as frequently as would be expected
(i.e., lower bound of the 90% confidence interval surrounding the EB geometric mean [EB05]
2). We clinically reviewed those HDCV reports containing PTs which exceeded the data mining threshold noted above.

Results
During the 25 years of this study, VAERS received 1,611 reports after HDCV (Table 1); ninetythree (5.8%) were coded as serious which included five deaths (Table 2). In 31 (33.3%) of 93
serious reports, the primary diagnosis was verified by review of medical records. Most reports
after HDCV were received during 1992–1996 and 1999–2004. A marked reduction in reports
was observed for years 2005 and 2006 (Fig 1). HDCV was the only vaccine listed in 1,424
(88.4%) reports. The three most frequent MedDRA PTs among all reports were pyrexia
(293,18.2%), headache (288,17.9%), and nausea (266,16.5%). These PTs were also predominantly noted among serious reports (Table 3).

Death reports
There were five death reports after HDCV and the causes of death are shown in Table 2. The
causes of death in four reports were unrelated to vaccination. In one report in which the cause
of death was acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM), the possibility that HDCV could
have contributed to the condition could not be ruled out. This report involved a 34 year-old
female who received two doses of HDCV, 7 days apart. She had received rabies vaccines in the
past without problems. Two days after the second dose of HDCV, she presented with hemiparesis, fever, headache, neck pain, photophobia, speech impairment, right leg tremors, nausea
and vomiting. She was hospitalized and was treated with steroids and intravenous antibiotics,
but her condition worsened and she died 9 days after vaccination. The autopsy found the cause
of death as acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) following rabies vaccine. Pathological examination of the patient’s brain tissue found pathological changes compatible with
ADEM. PCR testing of the same lot of Imovax administered to the patient was negative for
rabies virus.

Non-death serious reports
The most frequent AE diagnostic category noted among non-death serious reports was
immune system disorders, which accounted for 23 (26.1%) of 88 reports (Table 4). Sixteen of
these reports were hypersensitivity or non-anaphylactic allergic reactions, and seven were
reports of anaphylaxis. General disorders and administration site conditions, comprised
mainly of constitutional signs and symptoms (e.g., headache, fever), accounted for 21 (23.9%)
reports. Nervous system disorders were noted in 18 (20.4%) reports, including GBS (four
reports) and seizures (three reports).

Pre-specified conditions
Anaphylaxis. Twelve anaphylaxis reports were identified, seven of which were serious.
The onset interval from vaccination to the reported occurrence of symptoms was <24 hours
for ten patients. For two patients, the interval was 26 hours and 2 days, respectively. Among
the 12 cases, anaphylaxis reportedly occurred after the following doses of HDCV: first dose (1
case), second dose (4), third dose (4), booster (2 for pre-exposure prophylaxis), and not
reported (1). Two patients received both PCECV and HDCV; one report stated that anaphylactic reactions occurred after the third dose with PCECV and after the fourth dose with HDCV,
and the other report did not specify. One person received concomitant Tetanus and diphtheria
toxoids adsorbed vaccine, but the other eleven reports listed HDCV as the only vaccine

Among the serious cases, six recovered, and in one case the recovery status was not reported.
Median age was 41 years (range 13–51 years); six reports were in females, four in males and in
two, the sex was not reported. Two reports met Brighton level 1 criteria. The other reports
could not be further assessed, as no medical records were available for review. Of the five nonserious cases, four reportedly recovered and the recovery status for the other one was not
reported. Of note, three of the 12 patients had experienced other adverse events after previous
or subsequent doses of rabies vaccine, such as fever, headache, pruritus, angioedema, and rash.

Reports are classiﬁed as serious based on the Code of Federal Regulations if one of the following is reported: death, life-threatening illness, hospitalization
or prolongation of hospitalization, permanent disability, or a congenital anomaly [11].

Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS). Four reports of GBS after HDCV were received: two in
males aged 25 and 42 years, and two in females aged 16 and 47 years. Two reports were verified
and both met Brighton level 2 criteria; their time interval from vaccination to onset of symptoms was 12 and 85 days. Among the four GBS patients the 16-year-old female had presented
with vomiting and diarrhea 1 week before receiving HDCV. No other patient had a history of
gastrointestinal or upper respiratory infections before being vaccinated. All GBS patients presented varying neurological symptoms characterized mainly by increasing weakness, numbness, and/or tingling in extremities and difficulty walking. The 25-year-old male presented
with respiratory failure and required intubation. He was treated with intravenous steroids and
intravenous immunoglobulin and recovered. Three of the patients recovered, but the recovery
status of the fourth was not reported.
Pregnancy. Four reports described HDCV vaccination during pregnancy: three during the
first trimester, and in the other report the trimester was not reported. AEs noted included two
reports of spontaneous abortion, and one each of syncope and a non-anaphylaxis allergic
reaction.

Datamining analysis
Through July 20, 2015, data mining analysis revealed disproportional reporting for the PTs
angioedema and urticaria for HDCV. Because these allergic-type signs and symptoms had
been reported in the past, no further review was needed. No disproportional reporting was
observed for other PTs, including GBS or other neurological conditions.

Discussion
During the period of the study, a total of 3.8 million doses of HDCV were distributed in the US
(data shown with permission of Sanofi Pasteur). In our review of 25 years’ of AE reports to

VAERS following HDCV we did not observe any new or unexpected AEs. The vast majority of
AEs were non-serious and already known to be associated with HDCV. We noted a marked
decrease in the number of reports during 2005 and 2006 which coincides with the recall of several vaccine lots of HDCV during 2004 [17]. The most common AEs reported were consistent
with injection site reactions observed during pre-licensure trials and with hypersensitivity reactions that were previously described [1,6]. We also noted that constitutional symptoms (e.g.,
headache, nausea, fever) were among the most frequently reported AEs, which is consistent
with findings from pre-licensure studies [1,5].
During the first four years of post-marketing experience, systemic allergic reactions were
observed at a rate of 11 cases per 10,000 vaccinees [6]. Most of these reactions were associated
with booster immunizations. Consistent with this earlier finding, we noted (through automated
analysis of reports, clinical review of serious reports, and Empirical Bayesian data mining) that
hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., urticaria, pruritus) were frequently reported. Anaphylactic
reactions were more likely to occur among individuals who had experienced symptoms or

signs compatible with a hypersensitivity reaction after HDCV. Although these anaphylactic
reactions after HDCV are rare, they pose a serious dilemma for the patient and the attending
physician. A patient’s risk for acquiring rabies must be carefully considered before deciding to
discontinue vaccination [1,2]. Recommendations from the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices state that once initiated, rabies prophylaxis should not be interrupted or discontinued because of local or mild systemic adverse reactions to rabies vaccine. Usually such
reactions can be successfully managed with anti-inflammatory, antihistaminic, and antipyretic
agents. When a person with a history of hypersensitivity to rabies vaccine must be revaccinated,
empiric intervention such as pretreatment with antihistamines might be considered. Epinephrine should be readily available to counteract anaphylactic reactions, and the patient should be
observed carefully immediately after vaccination [1].
GBS is an acute, immune-mediated paralytic disorder of the peripheral nervous system [18].
GBS is most commonly associated with Campylobacter jejuni and other infectious agents, and
it is believed to be an autoimmune process triggered by antigenic stimulation leading to demyelination and destruction of peripheral nerves [18]. An increased risk of GBS after influenza vaccination was first observed with the 1976–1977 A/New Jersey (‘‘swine influenza”) vaccine [19].
Although questions about GBS following non-influenza vaccines have been raised, no study
has confirmed a causal association between GBS and other vaccinations [20].
Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) was noted as the cause of death in one
report. ADEM is a severe and sudden demyelinating disease which may occur following viral
or bacterial infections, and less often, following vaccinations [21]. However, the association
between ADEM and vaccination, including rabies vaccines, are mostly from case reports [22–
24]. The Institute of Medicine reviewed the available evidence for a limited number of vaccines
(not including rabies vaccines) and found there was no evidence to accept or reject a causal
association between ADEM and vaccination [25].
VAERS is a national system which is useful for identifying rare AEs and events that were
not observed during pre-licensure trials. Any safety concern or ‘signal’ should be studied in
other systems or through the design of epidemiological studies [8]. VAERS is a spontaneous
reporting system that has important limitations which include over- or under-reporting, biased
reporting, and inconsistency in quality and completeness of reports [8]. With few exceptions,
such as injection site reactions, VAERS generally cannot assess causality between an AE and
receipt of a vaccine.
Rabies is a life-threatening disease, and the benefits of vaccination far outweigh the risks in
persons exposed or potentially exposed to the virus. Our findings are reassuring. Most AEs
were non-serious and have previously been described.
