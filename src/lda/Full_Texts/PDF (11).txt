Abstract
Background: Methylphenidate, a stimulant used to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, has the potential to be used
nonmedically, such as for studying and recreation. In an era when many people actively use social networking services, experience
with the nonmedical use or side effects of methylphenidate might be shared on Twitter.
Objective: The purpose of this study was to analyze tweets about the nonmedical use and side effects of methylphenidate using
a machine learning approach.
Methods: A total of 34,293 tweets mentioning methylphenidate from August 2018 to July 2019 were collected using searches
for “methylphenidate” and its brand names. Tweets in a randomly selected training dataset (6860/34,293, 20.00%) were annotated
as positive or negative for two dependent variables: nonmedical use and side effects. Features such as personal noun, nonmedical
use terms, medical use terms, side effect terms, sentiment scores, and the presence of a URL were generated for supervised
learning. Using the labeled training dataset and features, support vector machine (SVM) classifiers were built and the performance
was evaluated using F1 scores. The classifiers were applied to the test dataset to determine the number of tweets about nonmedical
use and side effects.
Results: Of the 6860 tweets in the training dataset, 5.19% (356/6860) and 5.52% (379/6860) were about nonmedical use and
side effects, respectively. Performance of SVM classifiers for nonmedical use and side effects, expressed as F1 scores, were 0.547
(precision: 0.926, recall: 0.388, and accuracy: 0.967) and 0.733 (precision: 0.920, recall: 0.609, and accuracy: 0.976), respectively.
In the test dataset, the SVM classifiers identified 361 tweets (1.32%) about nonmedical use and 519 tweets (1.89%) about side
effects. The proportion of tweets about nonmedical use was highest in May 2019 (46/2624, 1.75%) and December 2018 (36/2041,
1.76%).
Conclusions: The SVM classifiers that were built in this study were highly precise and accurate and will help to automatically
identify the nonmedical use and side effects of methylphenidate using Twitter.

Introduction
Methylphenidate is a stimulant that is widely used for treating
attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) [1]. It was

approved for use in children and adolescents, and recently for
adult ADHD, in several countries including the United States
[2]. The use of methylphenidate is increasing worldwide [3].
Although methylphenidate is considered safe to use when taken

as prescribed, it does have the potential for abuse because of its
focus-enhancing, appetite-reducing, and euphoric effects [4,5].
In particular, more and more students are taking methylphenidate
for academic purposes, calling it a “smart drug” or “study drug”
[6-10]. A previous systematic review of 21 studies showed that
5%-9% of grade school- and high school-age children, as well
as 5%-35% of college-age students, misused stimulants such
as methylphenidate and amphetamines [11]. In addition, children
and adolescents take methylphenidate to stay up for parties and
experience euphoria [8,9]. Due to the potential abuse of
methylphenidates, many countries classify and control the drug
legally [3,4].
Children and adult ADHD patients can benefit from the
therapeutic effects of methylphenidate with few side effects
when the drug is used as prescribed [1]. However, studies have
shown that children and adolescents who use methylphenidate
to treat ADHD have a 60% higher risk of sleep disorders and a
266% higher risk of loss of appetite than those in control groups
[12]. In addition, children and adolescents with ADHD often
have comorbid mood disorders and anxiety disorders, and the
use of stimulants such as methylphenidate could exacerbate
these comorbidities [13]. Sometimes methylphenidate can cause
hallucinations and delusions [14,15]. The rates of adverse drug
reactions to methylphenidate, including agitation, irritability,
and elevated heart rate, increase when it is abused [1,4,10]. A
total of 40% of 394 toxic exposures of methylphenidate reported
in Denmark involved recreational use [3]. Central nervous
system and constitutional symptoms, such as anorexia, fatigue,
and insomnia, were reported in 263 out of 323 cases (81.4%),
and cardiovascular symptoms, such as arrhythmias,
hypertension, and myocardial infarctions, were reported in 227
out of 323 (70.3%) of the symptomatic cases [3]. The number
of emergency room visits due to nonmedical use of ADHD
medications nearly doubled between 2005 and 2010, from 5085
to 9181 [16]. Thus, the abuse of methylphenidate has become
a public health problem.
It is important to know the state of abuse and side effects of
stimulants. Most studies of methylphenidate abuse have been
conducted using surveys [11]. The survey method is appropriate
for investigating the status and motivation of nonmedical use;
however, it is limited by efforts to conceal abuse, and some
potential subjects may decline to participate in the study because

of the fear of being discovered [9]. Postmarketing surveillance
studies using spontaneous reporting systems, such as the US
Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting
System, are suitable for analyzing the incidence and types of
side effects caused by the use of methylphenidates but are
limited in their ability to assess the current state of
methylphenidate use.
As a new means of investigation, social networking services
(SNSs) have begun to get attention in overcoming such
challenges. Nowadays, it has become common to share one's
thoughts, search for opinions, and interact with people with
similar ideas through SNSs. In contrast to other SNSs, Twitter
delivers most of its content as text rather than images, and many
tools have been developed to analyze the content or emotions
implicit in tweets. Consequently, it is relatively easy to analyze
Twitter users' experiences or thoughts on a particular topic.
Health researchers are increasingly using Twitter to analyze
content about various topics (56%), as well as for surveillance
(26%), engagement (14%), subject recruitment (7%),
intervention (7%), and network analysis (4%) [17]. From 2010
to 2015, the number of health researchers using Twitter
increased almost 20-fold [17]. Some studies have been
conducted to analyze tweets about sentiment toward marijuana
or tobacco smoking [18,19]. Recently, studies have been
conducted that used machine learning to analyze Twitter’s big
data repository. A study developed a classification program that
could automatically detect opioid users from Twitter [20].
Twitter and other SNSs are mainly utilized by younger users,
and these groups are more likely to be diagnosed with ADHD
or to abuse methylphenidate [21]. The aim of this study was to
analyze tweets about nonmedical use and side effects of
methylphenidate using a machine learning approach.

Methods
Study Design
The steps in this study were conducted in the following order:
tweet collection, manual annotation, feature generation,
supervised learning, and classification of the test dataset (see
Figure 1). The study was exempted from Institutional Review
Board review (201909-HR-067-01).

Tweet Collection
Tweets mentioning methylphenidate from August 2018 to July
2019 were collected using the Twitter premium search
application programming interface and Python, version 3.7.4
(Python Software Foundation). The following search terms for
methylphenidate and its brand names were used:
“methylphenidate,” “Aptensio,” “Biphentin,” “Concerta,”
“Daytrana,” “Equasym,” “Jornay,” “Medikinet,” “Metadate,”
“Methylin,” “Quillichew,” “Quillivant,” “Ritalin,” and
“Rubifen.” This study did not cover the drug Adhansia because
it was only approved in February 2019. Retweets were also
collected if the user added their own text to an original tweet
that contained the search terms. Duplicate tweets were removed,
and only tweets written in English were used.

Annotation
Among the collected tweets (N=34,293), 6860 (20.00%) were
randomly selected as a training dataset. First, two annotators
manually identified tweets mentioning first-hand experience.
Tweets about drugs other than methylphenidate, song lyrics,

humor, news, study results, or someone else’s experience were
annotated as non-first-hand experience [22]. Second, tweets
about first-hand experience were classified as nonmedical use,
side effects, and other. Tweets could be classified as pertaining
to both nonmedical use and side effects. Finally, tweets were
labeled positive and negative for two dependent variables:
nonmedical use and side effects. Due to the nature of the short
length of the text, it was often difficult to determine whether
the drug was used nonmedically. In such cases, tweet threads
or past tweets were checked to determine whether the user had
ever been diagnosed with a condition that required
methylphenidate. Interannotator agreement was assessed by
Cohen kappa values [23,24], and any disagreements were
resolved by discussion among psychiatrists.

Feature Generation
Several features for supervised learning were generated: personal
noun, nonmedical use terms, medical use terms, side effect
terms, sentiment scores, and the presence of a URL (see Table
1).

Personal Noun
The personal noun feature was generated to identify tweets
mentioning first-hand experience. Personal nouns were grouped
into one of four categories: first person, second person, third
person, and others. Others included terms that could be used to
describe someone else’s experience. Due to frequent
nonstandard grammatical usage on Twitter, common
modifications such as “im,” “iam,” and “ur” were also included.

Nonmedical Use Terms and Medical Use Terms
Prior to generating the features of nonmedical use terms, natural
language processing was performed using the tm package from
R, version 3.6.1 (The R Foundation), and RStudio. First,
numbers, punctuation, and stop words, such as “the,” “is,” “and,”
etc, were removed from the text of the tweets. Later, the tweet
http://www.jmir.org/2020/2/e16466/

XSL• FO
RenderX

text was divided by word unit. Words were converted to their
stems using the stemDocument function from R, and the
frequency of word appearance in each tweet was described in
a term-document matrix.
The counts of nonmedical use terms in individual tweets was
used as a feature and this feature included seven subfeatures:
general terms, alternative motives, overdose, alternative route
of administration, seeking, obtaining, and coingestion. Terms
were selected based on similar studies [25,26]. Further, words
related to nonmedical use were added by comparing words that
appeared at a frequency of 5% or higher in tweets annotated as
nonmedical use or negative. The counts of medical use terms
were used to exclude medical use of methylphenidate for the
treatment of ADHD or narcolepsy.

J Med Internet Res 2020 | vol. 22 | iss. 2 | e16466 | p. 4

JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH

Side Effect Terms
The counts of side effect terms were generated as a feature after
natural language processing as described above. Side effect
terms included general terms, loss of appetite, sleep problems,
psychiatric problems, heart problems, gastrointestinal problems,
neurological problems, sweating, and eye problems. As in the
selection of nonmedical terms, the terms included were added
by reference to previous studies [25] or by comparing the words
that appeared in the training dataset.

Sentiment Scores
Sentiment scores were used as a feature because users often
write polarized sentimental words when mentioning drug abuse
or side effects. Sentiment scores were calculated by adding the
number of positive words (each counting as +1) and the number
of negative words (each counting as -1) appearing in a tweet.
The Liu and Hu opinion lexicon dictionary, which contains
6800 positive and negative words in the English language, was
used for sentiment analysis [27]. Some negative words, such as
“wtf,” were added to the dictionary.

Presence of a URL
This feature was created to identify retweets containing the
user’s content or link to another website. Links to other websites
were usually news or study results.

Supervised Learning
A support vector machine (SVM) with a radial basis function
kernel was trained to classify nonmedical use and side effects
using the e1071 package from R and RStudio. Two parameters
of the SVM—cost and gamma—were tuned to achieve a better
performance. Because the training dataset had a very large
number of negative samples, 10-fold cross-validation was
performed on the training data, and inverse weights were
assigned to positive and negative samples to compensate for
the imbalance [28]. Due to the imbalance in the data, the F1
score (ie, harmonic mean of precision and recall) was used
instead of accuracy to measure the performance of the SVM
classifier. Precision, recall, accuracy, and F1 score were
calculated as follows:
Precision = TP / (TP + FP) (1)

Kim et al
Recall = TP / (TP + FN) (2)
Accuracy = (TP + TN) / (TP + TN + FP + FN) (3)
F1 = (2 × Precision × Recall) / (Precision + Recall)
(4)
True positives (TP), false positives (FP), true negatives (TN),
and false negatives (FN) were calculated by comparing
annotated results and predicted results.

Classification of Test Dataset
The SVM classifier separated the test dataset into nonmedical
use or side effects and negative. Tweets about nonmedical use
and side effects were counted. The number of tweets about
nonmedical use of methylphenidate each month was determined
to examine the correlation with the school term.

Results
From August 2018 to July 2019, 36,578 tweets were collected
using predetermined search terms. Tweets containing the words
“Ritalin” and “Concerta” were the most frequent (27,635/36,578,
75.55%, and 5485/36,578, 15.00%, respectively). In total,
34,293 nonduplicated tweets were ultimately selected: 6860
(20.00%) in the training dataset and 27,433 (79.99%) in the test
dataset.
Among the 6860 tweets in the training dataset, 2108 (30.73%)
mentioned first-hand experience, including 356 about
nonmedical use (5.19%) and 379 about side effects (5.52%). A
total of 20 tweets (0.29%) were annotated as pertaining to both
nonmedical use and side effects. Cohen kappa values were .73
and .75 for nonmedical use and side effects, respectively, which
means there was substantial agreement between the two
annotators.
The classification performance of SVM classifiers, expressed
as an F1 score, was 0.547 for nonmedical use and 0.733 for side
effects (see Tables 2 and 3). The low recall of the SVM classifier
for nonmedical use, despite its high precision, was responsible
for its low F1 score. Each feature contributed to improvement
of SVM classifiers (see Tables 2 and 3). With the exception of
nonmedical use and side effect terms, F1 scores were the lowest
when the feature personal noun was excluded.

From the test dataset (n=27,433), 361 tweets (1.32%) about the
nonmedical use and 519 tweets (1.89%) about the side effects
of methylphenidate were identified using SVM classifiers. A
total of 21 tweets (0.08%) were classified as pertaining to both
nonmedical use and side effects. Examples of tweets,
paraphrased to ensure anonymity, classified as nonmedical use
included “When I was young I snorted my Concerta only for
the head rush” and “Time to pop the Ritalin I been keeping.”
Paraphrased tweets classified as side effects included “Worst 9
days of my life. I thought Ritalin would calm the anxiety part

of the ADHD. But it makes me a short-fused angry psycho who
burst into tears spontaneously” and “Seizures, hallucinations,
paranoia is all Ritalin brought me. The side effects still bother
me.”
The monthly proportion of tweets about the nonmedical use of
methylphenidate is shown in Figure 2. The proportion was
highest in May 2019 (46/2624, 1.75%) and December 2018
(36/2041, 1.76%), which are the final exam periods in the United
States.

Discussion
Principal Findings
This study was conducted to analyze tweets about the
nonmedical use and side effects of methylphenidate. Because
there were more than 30,000 tweets mentioning methylphenidate
written in a year, it was difficult to classify them manually;
therefore, we used the SVM machine learning approach. Similar
stimulants, such as Adderall, mixed amphetamine salts, have
been studied before [25,29]. An early study using Twitter
measured the co-occurrence of nonmedical or side effect terms
among 213,633 tweets mentioning Adderall [25]. However, not
all Adderall tweets referenced first-hand experience; as the
author of that study mentioned, the analysis included 5169 song
lyrics [25]. Another recent study automatically detected tweets
http://www.jmir.org/2020/2/e16466/

related to the nonmedical use of Adderall using an SVM
approach [29]. However, the SVM classifier had a poor
performance: F1 score of 0.46, precision of 0.41, and recall of
0.51 [29]. Our study is the first to analyze tweets about the
nonmedical use and side effects of methylphenidate and has
two main advantages: training first-hand experience and better
performance.
In the annotation process, nonmedical use of methylphenidate
was identified in 5% of the training dataset, lower than in two
previous studies about Adderall (12.9% and 22.6%) [25,29].
This may be due to the popularity of Adderall. In a survey of
4580 college students, three-quarters of those who had engaged
in nonmedical use of stimulants over the past year had used
Adderall, and one-quarter had taken methylphenidate [7]. In
another survey, 54.2% of respondents who abused stimulants

(page number not for citation purposes)

JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH
used Adderall versus 15% who used methylphenidate [30].
Alternatively, this may be due to stringent standards used in
our study: we included only first-hand experience and evaluated
whether methylphenidate was administered for medical purposes
based on past tweets from the users.
Nonmedical use and side effect terms improved the SVM
classifiers the most. The inclusion of personal nouns in the
model also significantly improved the classifier. Sentiment
scores also contributed to the improvement of the classifier,
although they did not capture users’ exact sentiments toward
methylphenidate. The previous Adderall study included
sentiment analysis in the SVM classifier, which slightly
improved the F1 scores [29].
The F1 scores of SVM classifiers for nonmedical use and side
effects were 0.547 and 0.733, respectively. SVM classifiers had
low F1 scores due to low recall, which may have induced
underestimation of nonmedical use and side effects in the test
dataset (1.3% and 1.9%, respectively). In particular, the recall
of nonmedical use was low because the classifier was built
solely on the content of tweets, although the label was annotated
by reviewing the users’ previous tweets to see if they had been
diagnosed with ADHD. However, because precision was high,
tweets classified as nonmedical use can be thought of as TP.
In May 2019 and December 2018, the US exams periods, the
proportion of tweets related to nonmedical use of
methylphenidate was highest. Tweet timing may differ from
the time of administration because users sometimes write about
past experiences. Nevertheless, higher ratios relative to the other
periods may indicate frequent administration of methylphenidate
during the exam period for the purpose of improving
concentration. The increase in the number of tweets about
stimulants in May 2019 and December 2018 was also reported
in the Adderall studies [25,29].

Limitations

Kim et al
ambiguous and previous tweets were not considered in the SVM
classifier. If user information or previous tweet information
could be included as a feature, it might help to solve the problem
of low recall. Another problem is scarcity of positive samples
relative to negative samples, despite the use of several methods
to resolve the problem of imbalance. The lack of positive data
made it impossible to learn about individual side effects, such
as sleep disorders and heart problems. Furthermore, the SVM
classifier for side effects was not sufficient to detect new side
effects because the terms corresponding to known representative
side effects were used as features in the supervised learning
process.
The frequency of tweets reported in this study does not imply
the actual prevalence of nonmedical use or side effects of
methylphenidate. First, the study only targeted users of Twitter,
which restricts use by individuals under the age of 13 years.
Second, the calculated percentage is the percentage of tweets,
not the percentage of respondents, as in a general survey. Third,
not all Twitter users who take methylphenidate will necessarily
write tweets about the drug and among those who do, some may
include the drug name and information about nonmedical use
or side effects in separate tweets within the same thread. Finally,
the study did not take into account various typos in the search
terms or non-English tweets.

Conclusions
This study built SVM classifiers that helped to automatically
identify the nonmedical use and side effects of methylphenidate
from Twitter. The SVM classifiers had high precision and
accuracy but low recall. Information available on Twitter is not
available during the prescription process and cannot be identified
through electronic medical records. Similar information can be
obtained through surveys, as in previous studies, but research
using Twitter has the advantage of saving time and cost required
for a survey. Future studies should seek to apply this method
to other social media platforms.

The final SVM classifiers had low recall, especially for tweets
about nonmedical use. This is because some tweets were
