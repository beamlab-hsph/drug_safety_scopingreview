Abstract
The development of novel drugs in response to changing clinical requirements is a complex and costly method
with uncertain outcomes. Postmarket pharmacovigilance is essential as drugs often have under-reported side effects. This study intends to use the power of digital media to discover the under-reported side effects of marketed
drugs. We have collected tweets for 11 different Drugs (Alprazolam, Adderall, Fluoxetine, Venlafaxine, Adalimumab,
Lamotrigine, Quetiapine, Trazodone, Paroxetine, Metronidazole and Miconazole). We have compiled a vast adverse
drug reactions (ADRs) lexicon that is used to filter health related data. We constructed machine learning models
for automatically annotating the huge amount of publicly available Twitter data. Our results show that on average
43 known ADRs are shared between Twitter and FAERS datasets. Moreover, we were able to recover on average
7 known side effects from Twitter data that are not reported on FAERS. Our results on Twitter dataset show a high
concordance with FAERS, Medeffect and Drugs.com. Moreover, we manually validated some of the under-reported
side effect predicted by our model using literature search. Common known and under-reported side effects can be
found at https://github.com/cbrl-nuces/Leveraging-digital-media-data-for-pharmacovigilance.

Introduction

Pharmacovigilance is the practice of monitoring effects of FDA approved drugs. It is the science and activities related
to detecting, assessing, understanding and preventing the adverse effects of drugs. The study of pharmacovigilance has
been recently widened to deal with herbal, traditional and complimentary medicines, blood related products, medical
devices and vaccines1 .
Drugs are extensively studied (in vitro experiments, in vivo experiments and clinical trials) before they become available to the public for general use. However, it is evident that drugs in clinical trials are monitored for their side effects
under controlled conditions e.g. ethnic diversity, patient age group, dosage and duration. The general and flexible
use of these drugs, particularly in less regulated regions like Africa and South Asia is likely to produce previously
unobserved side effects and introduce new risks. Post-market pharmacovigilance is required as clinical trials involve
limited number of patients, making it difficult to cover broader patterns and trends of drugs. Patient groups such as
pregnant women and children are often excluded from clinical trials due to concerns of teratogenicity and ethical issues
yet these drugs are often prescribed to such patient groups once available in the market2, 3 . Moreover, these patient
groups are also active web and social media users4 . Previous studies show that it is highly likely that FDA approved
drugs will show adverse reactions due to several known and yet to be discovered off-targets5, 6 .
Current pharmacovigilance efforts have room for improvement as numerous approved drugs have been withdrawn
from the market due to their adverse events. One famous example is of Thalidomide, which was introduced in late
1957 and was widely prescribed as a safe treatment for morning sickness and nausea. Children of pregnant women
on Thalidomide prescription showed congenital abnormalities that caused severe birth defects7 . Thalidomide was
removed from the market in most countries in 1965. Nevertheless, it continued to be used for the treatment of leprosy,
and in more recent years, its indications have been extended to a much wider range of medical conditions8 . Despite
being allowed only under strict supervision and specialist advice, between 1969 and 1995, 34 cases of thalidomide
embryopathy were registered in leprosy endemic areas in South America by the Latin American Collaborative Study
of Congenital Malformations9 .
There is an emerging trend in people to use social media and websites to reach out to doctors and pharmaceutical companies10 . Similarly, health-care professionals and patients are discussing the adverse experiences related to medicinal
products using the digital media platforms11 . Some studies have explored the use of social media data for pharmacovigilance12–14 . Nikfarjam et al. tagged mentions of drug side-effects in social media posts from Twitter and online
health community DailyStrength15 . Similarly Cocos et al. developed a deep learning based method for labeling ADRs

442

in Twitter posts16 . These studies were helpful in identifying the mentions of ADRs, however, downstream analysis is
required to perform qualitative analysis on these ADRs15, 16 . Freifeld et al. evaluated the level of concordance between
drug side-effects from Twitter data and adverse events (AE) reported in the FAERS17 . They provided the correlation by
system organ class between adverse event (AE) in Twitter and consumer report, but did not perform any quantitative
analysis for actual AEs and do not provide any mechanism to control false positives. MacKinlay et al. investigated the
ADR surveillance by analyzing tweets and evaluated their methodology against the reports in the FAERS database18 .
Smith et al. presented a method to compare ADRs mentioned in social media with FAERS, drug information databases
(DIDs), and systematic reviews19 . Even though some studies have started analysing social media data for augmenting
pharmacovigilance efforts, but existing studies (i) do not account for unstructured nature of the data on the social
media platforms appropriately, (ii) fail to quantify the quality of data from social media, and (iii) fail to control for the
high noise in such data platforms.
In this study, we try to overcome the above mentioned limitations by (i) compiling a large phrasal ADR lexicon
that is specific for ADRs, descriptive in nature and wherein the phrases representing the same ADR are grouped
together using semantic similarity based hierarchical clustering, ii) comparing the ADRs found from Twitter with three
reporting systems: FDA’s AERS (FAERS)20 , MedEffect1 and Drugs.com2 ; iii) using a classification model followed
by a statistical model to filter out possible noise and false positives.
We used our lexicon to mine the ADRs reported on Twitter for 11 drugs (Alprazolam, Adderall, Fluoxetine, Venlafaxine, Adalimumab, Lamotrigine, Quetiapine, Trazodone,Paroxetine, Metronidazole and Miconazole). We were able
to recover a significant number (approximately 50 on average) of known side effects of each drug from Twitter and
predict the under-reported side effect of the 11 drugs in our dataset. Our results suggest that Twitter data shows a high
concordance with FAERS (approximately 43 side effects on average) and other reporting systems and can be used as
an additional source for enhancing pharmacovigilance practices. Our study will help the drug regulatory agencies and
pharmaceutical companies in performing post-market pharmacovigilance using publicly available digital media data.

Methods and Techniques

2.1

Data Collection and preprocessing

We shortlisted 11 drugs for which significant data was available on Twitter (Table 1). Drugs are marketed under
different names (Fluoxetine is also marketed as Prozac, Prozac Weekly, and Sarafem), therefore we have used a list of
all the alternate names by augmenting brand names from Drug.com in the list compiled by Sarkar A, et al.21 . Moreover,
data from Twitter does not follow language rules and can have spelling and grammatical errors (Xanax can be written
as xanaxx and xnaax). Therefore, all alternate names of the drugs and their common misspellings were used to collect
the data from Twitter using tweepy3 and twitterscraper 4 APIs.
Apart from Twitter data, we also used the reviews data available at Drugs.com, FAERS and MedEffect. For Drugs.com
we used the data compiled by Graber et al.22 . For collecting FAERS’s data, we used the openFDA20 “drug adverse
event” API to download all the available files of Drug Adverse Events data using a python scraper. Similarly we also
collected the ADRs reported on MedEffect for these drugs. From both Twitter and online reviews datasets redundant
records were removed, followed by the application of stemming and lemmatization. The number of unique tweets and
reviews found for each drug can be seen in the Table 1.
2.2

Data Classification

We only used tweets containing at least one drug name and an ADR. Due to the unstructured nature of the Twitter
data, we need to define the context of the tweets. For example:
(i) I had xanax and it caused me anxiety
(ii) Can Xanax cause anxiety?

Table 1: Shows the data collected from Twitter, MedEffect, Drugs.com and FAERS for 11 different drugs.

In the first tweet it is being portrayed that the user had anxiety after having Xanax, we categorized such tweets as
“Health”, whereas in the second tweet a question is being put. It might be possible that drug name and side effect may
co-occur in the same tweet but in different context therefore we categorized such tweets as “Non-Health”. In order to
reduce the false positives, we removed the tweets falling in the category of “Non-Health”. The manual classification
of thousands of tweets is a tedious task, so we converted this into a classification problem. From the collected Twitter
data set, 2, 500 random health related tweets were manually annotated as “Health” and 2, 500 non-health tweets were
were manually annotated as “Non-Health”.
For training the machine learning models on the manually annotated data, we extracted features that capture the
semantics and contextual information. To accomplish this we used two pre-trained word2vec models. One from “Distributional Semantics Resources for Bio-medical Text Processing” by Pyysalo et al. (2013)23 , trained on Wikipedia,
PubMed and PMC and the second by Godin et al. trained on over 400 million Twitter microposts24 . We also used Term
Frequency Inverse Document Frequency (tf-idf) features, that is a term weighting scheme representing the important
of a word is in a corpus25, 26 . We only used the data that is classified as “health” for further analysis (as shown in Table
1).
2.3

Tanimoto Coefficient

In order to infer the value of occurrence of a particular side effect in a drug, we calculated the tanimoto coefficient “σ”
of a drug with each side-effect.
σ=

Di ∩ Sj
Di ∪ Sj

(1)

Di ∪ Sj =f (Di ) + f (sj ) − (Di ∩ Sj )
where Di represents the name of a drug and Sj represents the side effect. i is iterated over the 11 drugs in the dataset
and j is iterated over the 21, 550 side effect groups. f (Di ) and f (Sj ) represent the number of tweets that contain drug
Di and side effect Sj respectively. The tanimoto coefficient σ has a range between 0 and 1, where 0 represents lowest
similarity and 1 represents highest similarity.

Results and Discussion

3.1

Lexicon Compilation

In our previous study, we compiled a large phrasal ADR lexicon from FAERS (containing 20,285 phrases) and automatically clustered the phrases representing the same ADRs27 . In this study, we expanded this lexicon by adding
additional phrasal ADRs from MedEffect5 and CHV6 . In order to compile a list of only ADRs, we filtered the CHV
phrases by excluding the concepts with UMLS IDs that were not listed in SIDER28 (following the approach of Azadeh
Nikfarjam et al.29 ). We grouped the ADRs together that had the same UMLS IDs to obtain 4, 101 phrasal ADR groups.

We added these ADR groups and 11, 956 ADRs from MedEffect to the lexicon from FAERS. We had a total of 34, 392
unique groups7 and our goal was to iteratively merge the groups representing similar ADRs.
3.2

Lexicon Clustering

Results from our previous study showed that nine different algorithms can be used for the automatic clustering of the
phrasal ADR lexicon27 . Here, we used Silhouette Coefficient to determine the number of clusters for our lexicon30 .
Higher Silhouette Coefficient scores represent a model with better defined clusters. For all nine clustering algorithms,
we computed Silhouette Coefficient for the values of k (number of clusters) ranging from 50 to 34, 300 with an
increment of 50. All nine clustering algorithms have the highest Silhouette Coefficient around 21, 550 (Figure 1a), so
we chose 21, 550 as the value of k (number of clutters).

coefficient around 21, 550 (b) “cophenetic correlation coefficient” of nine clustering algorithms, “Average min distance Average”
algorithm has highest score of 0.54. We selected “Average min distance Average” as a clustering algorithm with k=21, 550 (number
of clusters).

We used cophenetic correlation coefficient, a measure of how good a dendrogram preserves the pairwise distances
between the original data points, to select the best performing clustering algorithm31 . A good clustering has cophenetic correlation close to 1. We computed cophenetic correlation for all nine clustering algorithms and “Average min
distance Average” algorithm obtained the highest score of 0.54 (Figure 1b). Therefore, we selected “Average min distance Average” as an algorithm to cluster the phrases representing the same ADRs8 . This clustering scheme uses the
average of min distance to compute the semantic similarity between two phrases and “average” as linkage criteria27 .
3.3

Annotation and Noise Removal

In order to automate the annotation process, we constructed different models to classify the tweets/reviews into
“health” or “non-health” classes based on our manually annotated dataset of 5, 000 tweets (see methods for details).
We performed k-fold cross validation of different machine learning classifiers for selecting the best model using two
different features: (1) tf-idf along with word2vec trained on twitter and (2) tf-idf along with word2vec trained on
Wikipedia, PubMed and PMC. The MLPClassifier using tf-idf and word2vec trained on twitter outperformed other
models (Table 2). Deep learning models were not used due to the limited annotated training data available in this
study. Our results also suggest that as more data is fed to the classifiers, their performance increases significantly.

Analysis on Cleaned Data

We compiled the lists of known side effects and indications of each drug from WebMD9 , Drugs.com10 and MedlinePlus11 . After filtering the “Health” tweets we calculated the tanimoto coefficient “σ” for each drug on the tweets
and reviews dataset. Indications of each drug were removed from our results. While the remaining results are either
known side effects, possible under reported ADRs or false positives. Table 3 shows the number of known ADRs found
from twitter, FAERS, MedEffect and Drugs.com. On average 43 ADRs for each drug are shared between twitter and
FAERS datasets. Root-Mean-Squared-Error (RMSE) between the tanimoto coefficient scores σ of all common ADRs
between Twitter and FAERS datasets was 0.014, thus demonstrating a high level of agreement between the results
from Twitter and FAERS. Similar results were found between Twitter and MedEffect dataset and between Twitter and
Drugs.com dataset (Table 3). Moreover, Twitter was able to recover on average 7 known side effects that were not
reported in FAERS. This supports the fact that digital media sites such as Twitter could be used to augment the current
pharmacovigilance efforts.
In order to show how good twitter results are in recovering the known side effect as compared to other reporting
systems, we used the known side effect list to get the top ten known side effect for each drug on the basis of tanimoto

coefficient. It can be seen from the Figure 2 and Table 4 that the top 10 known side effects found from Twitter are
also reported on other reporting systems (FAERS, MedEffect and Drugs.com) with high tanimoto coefficient scores σ.
This shows that the data from twitter is meaningful and it can be used along with the current ADR reporting systems.

Comparison with previous studies

Sarker et al14 assessed the possibility of utilizing social media as a resource for prescription medication abuse and
they reported “weight loss” as a common abuse of “Adderall”. Our study finds similar results with σ of 0.0008 and
0.0012 on Twitter and FAERS dataset respectively. Smith et al.19 developed a method to compare ADRs mentioned
in social media with those in traditional sources and their results showed that “headache” was reported with relatively
high index values on FAERS and Drug Information Databases. Our results also show that “headache” was reported
on Twitter, FAERS and Drugs.com with σ of 0.0152, 0.0072 and 0.0012 respectively. Chavant et al32 showed that
the occurrence of “memory disorders” reported for “Alprazolam” and “Fluoxetine” in the French PharmacoVigilance
Database (FPVD) are 14 and 16 respectively. Our methodology also showed “memory disorders” ADR with high
σ values for “Alprazolam” (Twitter = 0.0009, FAERS = 0.0109, MedEffect = 0.0087, Drugs.com = 0.0057) and
“Fluoxetine” (Twitter = 0.0001, FAERS = 0.0006, Drugs.com = 0.0013).
O'Connor et al13 evaluated the viability of Twitter as a source of ADR mentions and its potential value for pharmacovigilance. They reported a list of drugs with their most common adverse reactions and the most frequent adverse
effects extracted from the Twitter data using their automated system. We also reported the tanimoto coefficient “σ”
score of these ADRs. It can be seen in Table 5 that our method is able to recover most of the ADRs reported by their
method with significantly high scores. Our analysis showed several under-reported side effects for the drugs in our
dataset. Some of the unknown side effects predicted by our methodology and previously reported by case studies have
been listed in Table 6 along with a sample tweet and/or online review from our datasets.
For Prozac it has been an active debate for the past three decades whether it causes aggressive behaviour in subjects
or not33 . Our results from the Twitter (σ = 0.0026), FAERS (σ = 0.0013) and Drugs.com (σ = 0.005) suggest that
certain patients do experience increase in aggressiveness after taking Prozac. Another side effect for Prozac that had
a relatively high tanimoto coefficient for both Twitter (σ = 0.0096) and Drugs.com (σ = 0.0164) is having unusual
dreams. Several studies have previously reported this side-effect for Prozac34, 35 . Upset stomach had a σ of 0.004 for
Twitter, 0.001 for FAERS and 0.008 for Drugs.com data. This side effect has been reported in a study on preschool
and high school children36 .

Sample Tweet(s) / review(s)
When I first started taking this medication I changed from Lovan, and for about 2 weeks I felt on top of the
world! I was motivated, full of energy and was actually laughing after a long period of depression. It was all
downhill from there... I reached the point where my brain just didn’t feel right, I was more depressed than ever,
feeling desperate and looking for a way out of feeling so low. I stopped taking the medication, initially to piss off
my husband, and it was then that I realized this medication was the cause of my depressive moods, anxiety and
anger. I would not recommend this medication to anyone without close psychiatric monitoring.
1. dammit my fluoxetine give me such bad vivid dream; 2. im having bad dream every night after i start taking
fluoxetine 3. It’s great. I get songs in my head or find myself humming, and that hasn’t happened for a long time.
More random positive thoughts too. And much less of the bad ones. I sometimes feel down, but it’s not often and
I think unavoidable. The side affect I notice is phases of vivid bad dreams. More nightmares and more stand that
are stressful and occupy my mind too much, which makes me feel less rested.
1. the side effect can be kind of sudden but yes there is a wait for the effect i spent about two week with headache
getting used to prozac till it settled into my system sometimes i still have upset stomach dont take them on an
empty stomach either and drink more water; 2. urgh prozac had it many year ago gave me epic nightmare panic
attack and a constant upset stomach gave up and stopped taking it after week if it disagrees with you ask if you
can have high dose citalopram instead
Xanax is a miracle for me. I can’t live without it. It is not addicting. I never experienced withdrawl symptoms
either. I am usually tense, high strung and anxious. Xanax makes me happy, easy going, talkative, calm. It helps
me sleep, I can’t sleep without it. I take zoloft and seroquel but without xanax nothing seems to work or help me.
I love xanax and I take it daily or else I really just can’t get through the day. I have anger and a short fuse and
bad temper and xanax calms my storms. Xanax is the only thing that works for me and makes me sane and able
to face life head on.
1. it quite obvious that adderall cause selective memory loss; 2. shit he looking so bad even the orange paint cant
hide it adderall withdrawal symptom intense craving depression insomnia shortterm memory loss irritability and
anger hunger pang panic attack anxietylethargyhallucination http ofsnortingadderall

For Xanax, we predicted heart burn as one of the under-reported side effects with σ of 0.002 for Twitter, and 0.0003
for FAERS. A previous clinical trial reported heart burn in more than 30% of the patients37 . Similarly, we predicted
talkativeness as another under-reported side effect for Xanax. A previous case study has reported increased talkativeness in an elderly patient with a history of anxiety, mood disorders, and hypothyroidism38 . Similarly, a previous study
supports our results on Adderall induced memory loss (σ = 0.0008 for Twitter data and σ = 0.0002 for FAERS
data)39 . A complete list of under-reported side effects that were found for the 11 drugs across all platforms can be
found at https://github.com/cbrl-nuces/Leveraging-digital-media-data-for-pharmacovigilance.

Conclusion

Conducting clinical trials of drugs is expensive and has its own restrictions on patient groups and drug usage. Moreover, manual annotation of the data is a tedious and time consuming task. Digital data (social media and online
reviews) can help in reducing the cost of pharmacovigilance efforts and can help in gathering unknown side effects
of drugs. This research work provides the groundwork for augmenting current pharmacovigilance efforts. We constructed several classifiers to automatically annotate health related tweets. We were able to recover several known side
effects for the 11 drugs in our dataset using social media and online reporting system. Some of the predicted side
effects have already been reported by previous studies, therefore lending validity to our findings.
We filtered the tweets on a vast ADRs lexicon and then removed the possible false positives using a classifier. The data
available on Twitter is without any specific medical focus and suffers from high false positives. Such false positives get
very low tanimoto coefficient score due to large volume of tweets and can be removed by our methodology. Moreover,
it is important to distinguish false positives from novel ADRs. This currently requires manual efforts. Our approach
could highlight possible under-reported ADRs, however, subsequent manual examination by experts is required to
confirm these ADRs.
The unknown side effects found by our model are the possible under reported ADRs that were not present in the list
of known ADRs and need further clinical validation. In future we plan to improve the quality and quantity of data
annotation and use the similar pipeline to identify the indication/symptoms of infectious diseases such as COVID-19
reported on digital media.
