Abstract. As social media are an interesting source of information for
pharmacovigilance, we implemented a novel visualisation method for
pharmacovigilance specialists applied to French discussion forums. A word
embedding model was trained on posts to facilitate the identification of patterns
associated with adverse drug reactions.

1. Introduction
Nowadays, it has become frequent for patients to describe adverse drug reactions in
discussion forums. As a result, an immense amount of posts might contain precious
information for pharmacovigilance. Reviewing such voluminous data by
pharmacovigilance specialists is almost impossible without the use of natural language
processing and machine learning techniques. Before applying these techniques,
detecting and visualizing patterns in data is a major step in exploratory data analysis.
This step allows better understanding of data which leads to better strategy for further
knowledge extraction and interpretation. We propose an unsupervised learning
approach for visualizing patterns associated with adverse drug reactions. Our
visualisation is based on the output of word2vec [1], a word embedding language
model that regroups tokens that co-occur in similar contexts. We used a sample from a
dataset consisting of co-occurences between drugs and medical conditions previously
annotated using a supervised approach [2]. Then we performed 2D representations of
word embeddings of these annotations to figure if it is possible to highlight relevant
patterns associated with adverse drug reactions.

2. Methods and Results
A total of 665.662 messages were extracted from the medical discussion forum
Doctissimo2 from January 2020 to June 2020. After preprocessing and tokenizing the

posts, we applied a bigram function to merge words commonly used together. Then, we
trained a Skip-gram model [1] using Python 3 with the Gensim package. After running
a grid search for hyper parameters, we selected an embedding size of 300 dimensions
with windows of 7 tokens, a minimum count of 7 tokens, a negative sampling [3] of 10
and 7 iterations. The remaining parameters were set to defaults. A t-SNE [4]
visualisation allows us to see clusters of unigrams/bigrams that occur in the same
context. For example, Figure 1 shows two clusters associated with two French
medicinal products: Doliprane® (paracetamol) and Loxapac® (loxapine).

3. Discussion and Conclusion
These preliminary results show us that using word embeddings with medical forums
could be a promising approach for pharmacovigilance. However, performing additions
and subtractions on word embeddings was disappointing because some linear relations
between the word pairs ADR1:Drug1 and ADR2:Drug2 were not consistent. We
believe that further research is necessary to figure in which settings such approach is
reliable to infer knowledge with the proposed visual representation.
