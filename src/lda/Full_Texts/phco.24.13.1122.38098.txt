Application of an Empiric Bayesian Data Mining
Algorithm to Reports of Pancreatitis Associated with
Atypical Antipsychotics
Manfred Hauben, M.D., M.P.H.
Study Objective. To compare the results from one frequently cited data
mining algorithm with those from a study, which was published in a peerreviewed journal, that examined the association of pancreatitis with
selected atypical antipsychotics observed by traditional rule-based methods
of signal detection.
Design. Retrospective pharmacovigilance study.
Intervention. The widely studied data mining algorithm known as the Multiitem Gamma Poisson Shrinker (MGPS) was applied to adverse-event
reports from the United States Food and Drug Administration’s Adverse
Event Reporting System database through the first quarter of 2003 for
clozapine, olanzapine, and risperidone to determine if a significant signal of
pancreatitis would have been generated by this method in advance of their
review or the addition of these events to the respective product labels.
Measurements and Main Results. Data mining was performed by using nine
preferred terms relevant to drug-induced pancreatitis from the Medical
Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). Results from a previous
study on the antipsychotics were reviewed and analyzed. Physicians’ Desk
References (PDRs) starting from 1994 were manually reviewed to determine
the first year that pancreatitis was listed as an adverse event in the product
label for each antipsychotic. This information was used as a surrogate
marker of the timing of initial signal detection by traditional criteria.
Pancreatitis was listed as an adverse event in a PDR for all three atypical
antipsychotics. Despite the presence of up to 88 reports/drug-event
combination in the Food and Drug Administration’s Adverse Event
Reporting System database, the MGPS failed to generate a signal of
disproportional reporting of pancreatitis associated with the three
antipsychotics despite the signaling of these drug-event combinations by
traditional rule-based methods, as reflected in product labeling and/or the
literature. These discordant findings illustrate key principles in the
application of data mining algorithms to drug safety surveillance.
Conclusion. The optimal place of data mining algorithms in the
pharmacovigilance tool kit remains to be determined, requires
consideration of numerous factors that may affect their performance, and is
highly situation dependent.

Pharmacovigilance is principally concerned
with the detection of adverse events from
medicinal agents as early as possible in the
postapproval period, with minimal patient
exposure. These adverse events may be novel in
terms of their clinical nature, severity, and/or
frequency. Historically, various sources of
information have been used to detect signals of
such events, including spontaneous adverseevent reporting systems and the published
literature. Surveillance using these spontaneous
adverse-event reporting system databases
populated with huge numbers of drug-event
combinations often has been carried out by using
rule-based signal detection criteria that
incorporate various clinical or pharmacologic
judgments in combination with threshold
reporting frequencies.
As an example, one group of authors investigated the association of selected atypical antipsychotic agents (clozapine, olanzapine, and
risperidone) plus a typical antipsychotic
(haloperidol) with the adverse event of pancreatitis.1 They analyzed the United States Food and
Drug Administration’s (FDA’s) MedWatch Drug
Surveillance System and published literature
reports and concluded that although spontaneous
reports cannot definitively establish causality, the
information in these reports did support a causeand-effect relationship between the selected
atypical antipsychotics and pancreatitis. They
also conducted a reporting rate ratio analysis by
using externally derived exposure estimates to
evaluate possible interdrug differences. Clozapine
was associated with the highest reporting rate
ratio, and the atypical antipsychotics seemed to
be significantly different from the typical
antipsychotic haloperidol in terms of adjusted
reporting frequency of pancreatitis.
In hopes of supplementing such traditional
methods of pharmacovigilance, considerable
research is being conducted on the development
of computer-assisted signal detection algorithms,
also known as data mining algorithms, to screen
large spontaneous adverse-event reporting system
databases.2–8

Most published data have been generated by
using three methods: proportional reporting
ratios,2–4 an empiric Bayesian method known as
the Multi-item Gamma Poisson Shrinker
([MGPS]; Lincoln Technologies, Wellesley Hills,
MA),5, 6 and a neural network–based Bayesian
method know as the Bayesian Confidence
Propagation Neural Network (BCPNN). 7
Whereas the precise operational details of the
methods vary, they all use the internal association
structure of a spontaneous adverse-event
reporting system database to derive “expected”
counts of adverse events using an arbitrary
internal model of statistical independence. 2–5
These data mining algorithms have been
described as being “numerator-based” methods
since they derive a signal score or metric without
using external data sets to provide estimates of
drug exposure or utilization.9, 10
A comprehensive understanding of the
performance characteristics of these methods is
required to determine their optimal application
in pharmacovigilance, including integration with
traditional rule-based methods of signal
detection. The potential limitations in the form
of false-negative and false-positive findings, as
well as the possibility of delayed signaling of
adverse events, must be understood before these
methods can be endorsed as a required element
of good pharmacovigilance practice in all
settings. To date, drawing inferences from the
published literature is complicated by various
limitations and discordant results related to the
retrospective nature of most analyses,
nonsystematic samples of drugs and events, lack
of standardized data mining practices, inherent
differences between algorithms or models, lack of
criterion standards for adjudicating causality and
expectedness, and/or variable study design and
database architecture or environments.2–9
This study was a retrospective application of
one widely studied data mining algorithm (the
MGPS) to data derived from the FDA’s Adverse
Event Reporting System (AERS) database. The
goal was to see if a significant signal of pancreatitis associated with the atypical antipsychotics
studied previously1 would have been generated
by this method in advance of their review or the
addition of these events to the respective product
labels, and if the relative degrees of disproportional reporting correlated with their reporting
rate ratio analysis. The overall objective was to
stimulate discussion and illustrate important
considerations in the practical evaluation and
deployment of data mining algorithms in

1124

PHARMACOTHERAPY Volume 24, Number 9, 2004

pharmacovigilance. This analysis was limited to
AERS data and did not attempt to identify
additional cases in the published literature, as
was done in the previously mentioned study.1
Methods
The FDA AERS is a computerized information
database for postapproval safety surveillance. It
functions as an early warning system for adverse
drug reactions not detected during preapproval
testing. It contains adverse-event reports for
approved drugs and therapeutic biologic products
submitted in accordance with mandatory
reporting obligations by pharmaceutical companies
and voluntarily by health care professionals and
consumers. Adverse-event reports are reviewed
and coded for data entry in accordance with the
standardized terminology of the Medical
Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA).
Quarterly extracts are available through the
National Technical Information Service. These
quarterly updates were subjected to extensive
“cleaning” before data mining, including the
identification and removal of duplicate reports
and redundant drug nomenclature. The data
extract used for our analysis included data in
AERS through the first quarter of 2003.11
The data mining algorithm used for this
analysis was the MGPS. The theoretic basis of
MGPS has been described in detail elsewhere3 but
briefly is as follows: expected counts for item
sets (i.e., drug-event combinations) are based on
the product of the marginal probabilities of each
item (e.g., probability of drug over all events and
event over all drugs). The observed:expected
ratio is calculated initially as a crude disproportionality metric. Since the same ratio could be
obtained from cell counts (frequencies) of
markedly different sizes (observed:expected
ratios based on smaller cell counts being
considered more variable or imprecise), further
modeling that uses maximum likelihood
estimation and Bayesian inference are used to
adjust the crude observed:expected ratios based
on the respective cell counts. Each cell is
considered to represent a Poisson process in
which the Poisson parameter distribution is a
mixture of two  distributions. The prior
probability distribution of the  parameters are
obtained by applying an iterative maximum
likelihood algorithm to a negative binomial
mixture likelihood. Posterior estimates of the 
parameters are obtained by updating the prior
with the individual cell counts by the Bayes

theorem. By using logarithmic transformations
or taking the lower 5% cutoff of the posterior
distribution, we obtain an expectation value that
adjusts for the variability by down weighing or
“shrinking” the parameters, most notably for
drug-event combinations associated with low cell
counts. These metrics are known as the empiric
Bayes geometric mean and the EB05. An EB05
that equals 8 is interpreted to mean that the
number of reports of the particular drug-event
combination is 8 times greater than would be
expected if drug and event were independently
distributed in the database. The signal metric
used for a threshold in our analysis was the lower
5% cutoff of the distribution of the empiric Bayes
geometric mean greater than or equal to 2 (EB05 ≥ 2
is the signal threshold recommended by the developers of the algorithm in previous publications).5, 6
A variety of data mining options and parameters
exist including basic covariate adjustment
(stratification by age, sex, and year of report).
Stratification tends to reduce spurious associations
due to confounding and markedly decreases the
volume of disproportionalities.5, 6 Data mining
was performed against the background of all
drugs and events in AERS by using stratification
by age, sex, and year of reporting. The algorithm
allows the AERS database to be “rolled back” in
time so that data mining can be performed on
increasing time intervals from the year of the first
report in order to track the temporal evolution of
any signals over time. This procedure is known
as cumulative subsetting by year. Because data
mining that uses suspect drugs often generates
only larger signal scores of disproportionate
reporting compared with data mining that uses
suspect plus concomitant drugs, the analysis was
performed by using suspect drugs only.
The following nine MedDRA preferred terms
considered relevant to drug-induced pancreatitis
were used to perform data mining: blood amylase
increased, lipase increased, pancreatic enzymes not
otherwise specified (NOS) increased, pancreatic
haemorrhage, pancreatic injury, pancreatitis acute,
pancreatitis acute on chronic, pancreatitis
haemorrhagic (hemorrhagic), pancreatitis NOS.
The results for the antipsychotics evaluated
previously1 (clozapine, olanzapine, risperidone,
and haloperidol) were reviewed and analyzed.
Sequential Physicians’ Desk References (PDRs)
were then manually reviewed starting from 1994
to determine the first year that pancreatitis was
listed as an adverse event in each drug’s label.
The PDR is published in cooperation with
participating manufacturers. Each entry provides

APPLICATION OF AN EMPIRIC BAYESIAN DATA MINING ALGORITHM Hauben
an exact copy of the product’s FDA-approved
labeling. The Code of Federal Regulations
201.100(d)(1) requires that all safety-related
wording in the PDR be “same in language and
emphasis” as the approved labeling, which means
verbatim use of the language in the approved
product label.
Since the addition of an adverse event to the
product label represents the conclusion of a
process of signal detection and evaluation, and
given the PDR’s submission requirements for
label revisions (Mukesh Mehta, Thomson
Healthcare, Inc., personal communication,
2004), the timing of first label citation of the
relevant adverse events was used as a surrogate
indicator of the timing of initial signal detection
by traditional criteria.

Pancreatitis was listed as an adverse event in

the PDR for all three atypical antipsychotics. The
year in which the adverse event of pancreatitis
was first listed in the respective product labels in
the PDR was 1996 for clozapine, 12 1997 for
risperidone,13 and 2003 for olanzapine.14
The MGPS method failed to generate a signal
of disproportional reporting (EB05 ≥ 2) (Figures
1–4) for any of the selected drug-event combinations despite the accumulation of up to 88
reports/relevant adverse-event term. In fact, in
most instances, the data mining algorithm
indicated that the studied drug-event combinations appeared less frequently than would be
expected if the respective drugs and events were
independently distributed in the database. This
differs from a reporting rate ratio analysis with
exposure estimates used in the previously
published study1 to evaluate possible interdrug
differences in reporting of pancreatitis in which
clozapine was associated with the highest
reporting rate ratio followed by olanzapine.

This analysis found that a widely studied data
mining algorithm failed to generate a signal of
disproportional reporting of pancreatitis with
three atypical antipsychotic agents despite the
apparent signaling of these drug-event combinations
by traditional rule-based methods as reflected in
product labeling, the published literature, and/or
peer-reviewed expert clinical reviews. These
findings plus previously published data on data
mining algorithms suggest that although these
algorithms may help monitor the safety of drugs,
their capabilities and limitations should be well
understood in order to make appropriate

1968–1996

recommendations for use.
The discordant findings illustrate important
points and raise questions related to the practical
evaluation and deployment of data mining
algorithms in pharmacovigilance, including the
question of the incremental utility of data mining
algorithms in “real-life” pharmacovigilance
settings, comparative performance of various data
mining algorithms, and important caveats in the
interpretation of data mining output.
Although the possibility that the associations
described in the previously mentioned study1 are
completely spurious, for purposes of this
discussion we will accord considerable weight to

APPLICATION OF AN EMPIRIC BAYESIAN DATA MINING ALGORITHM Hauben
the expert clinical review of those authors,
bearing in mind the recognized limitations of
spontaneous reporting.
Given this, why would a data mining algorithm
fail to highlight an important drug-event
combination that expert clinical analysis detected
and what can we learn from the failure of the
data mining algorithm to generate a signal?
There are numerous mechanisms that may
explain the failure of a data mining algorithm to
generate a signal. The most basic relates to the
very nature of the disproportionality analysis that
underlies the commonly used data mining
algorithms. Drug-event combinations that are
“overrepresented” in a database of finite size (at a
given time point) must be accompanied by other
drug-event combinations being underrepresented.
Therefore, if a drug is strongly associated with
one or more adverse events, the latter features of
the drug’s safety profile may “drown out” signals
of other adverse events that may be causally
related. Also, if the background prevalence of the
drug or the event in the database is high, this
could result in failure to signal since “expected”
counts are derived from the marginal probabilities
of drug and event in the database. This, in
combination with the numerous influences on
reporting behavior, provides a conceptual
framework for understanding missed or delayed
signaling.
Differences between simple forms of disproportionality analysis and data mining algorithms
employing Bayesian inference are also pertinent
to the issue of false-negative and false-positive
findings. This analysis used an empiric Bayesian
data mining algorithm. Bayesian, and particularly
empiric Bayesian data mining algorithms such as
MGPS, are designed to down weight (“shrink”)
signals of disproportionate reporting, especially
for those drug-event combinations with low
numbers of reports. The statistical rationale is
that such estimates are theoretically unstable and
imprecise. The intention is to reduce the number
of spurious signals and resultant strain on
pharmacovigilance resources.10
The latter rationale may be an oversimplification.
It assumes that the reduced signal volume is due
to a diminished number of false-negative signals
owing to various confounding factors or biases,
rather than true causality. However, given the
expected trade-off between sensitivity and
specificity, it is not surprising that the capacity of
Bayesian data mining algorithms to detect truepositive signals can be concurrently degraded as
well.15 Although there are many other reasons

1127

for false-negative results with data mining
algorithms, it would be of interest to see if simple
forms of disproportionality analysis, such as
proportional reporting ratios, may have flagged
one or more of the associations not highlighted
by MGPS when commonly cited thresholds are
used. Precisely this type of performance
differential between proportional reporting ratios
and MGPS has been described with pancreatitis
associated with other drug classes 16 and
reinforces the possibility that statistical modeling
or adjustments designed to reduce signal volume
may entail a cost in terms of diminished capacity
to detect some important drug-event combinations.
Although these performance gradients are
important to bear in mind, findings from data
mining algorithms used in isolation do not fully
inform us about their deployment in real-life
pharmacovigilance settings. Since data mining
algorithms should be considered only as a
potential supplement to, and not a substitute for,
traditional signal detection techniques, the
crucial question is the incremental utility of data
mining algorithms when used as one component
of a rigorous and comprehensive pharmacovigilance
program that utilizes multiple approaches to
signal detection. It is quite likely that both the
added value of any given data mining algorithm
and performance differentials between algorithms
will be mitigated when filtered through the lenses
of clinical, pharmacologic, and epidemiologic
judgment used in traditional pharmacovigilance
practice.
Data mining is exploratory by nature, but it is
important to appreciate that the use of multiple
unvalidated threshold metrics, algorithms, and
post hoc case definitions makes retrospective
validation exercises (e.g., the data miner knows
the adverse event “to be signaled”) susceptible to
various interpretive biases. For example, in a
process akin to multiple comparisons and
orientation bias, a data miner with a strong
incentive to believe in a particular outcome may
successfully try one algorithm or metric
threshold after another and/or utilize nonspecific
case definitions (i.e., adverse-event terms) of
dubious clinical relevance to avoid results that
contradict preexisting expectations. Data mining
is a welcome addition to the pharmacovigilance
tool kit that has the potential to improve our
ability to monitor the safety of medicines, but
data dredging or torturing should be avoided.
The usefulness of data mining algorithms also
may be a function of the nature of the adverse
events being studied. Pancreatitis is an excellent

1128

PHARMACOTHERAPY Volume 24, Number 9, 2004

illustration of this since it has been included on
certain lists of so-called designated medical
events. Such lists include events on the basis of
medical importance, rarity, and/or overall level of
drug-attributable risk. Traditionally, as few as
1–3 reports of such events may be considered a
signal under certain circumstances. 17 The
findings of this analysis suggest that reliance on
data mining algorithms for the detection of
designated medical events, especially data mining
algorithms that significantly down weight scores
based on small numbers of reports, may be
hazardous and cannot be recommended at this
time. This may be especially hazardous for
certain designated medical events, such as
convulsions, that have a very high background
prevalence in spontaneous adverse-event
reporting system databases owing to reports of
breakthrough and withdrawal seizures. The
utility of data mining algorithms for adverse
events at the opposite spectrum of severity may
also be limited in part due to the high background
rate of these events in the database, which in turn
results in high expected counts.
The absence of a signal of disproportionate
reporting with a data mining algorithm therefore
should not be considered adequate to refute a
signal generated by traditional signaling criteria.
The converse is not true in that expert case-level
clinical review may be adequate to demonstrate
that a signal of disproportionate reporting from a
data mining algorithm represents a statistical or
spurious signal due to one or more confounding
factors and/or reporting biases.
The dissociation of findings between traditional
methods and data mining algorithms points to
the hazards of comparing signals between drugs
by any method. At professional meetings and
conferences, it has been suggested that differential
signal scores obtained with data mining
algorithms may be used as a qualitative index of
comparative toxicity among the drugs being
compared. Give the numerous factors that can
affect spontaneous reporting behavior and the
aforementioned methodologic limitations, this
practice is hazardous and cannot be recommended
before empiric validation.
Therefore, development of an optimal pharmacovigilance program requires consideration of
numerous elements that may influence the
incremental utility of data mining algorithms,
including the rigor of preexistent traditional
signal detection activities; the aforementioned
performance gradient (decreasing sensitivity,
increasing specificity) among simple disporpor-

tionality analysis, Bayesian methods, and empiric
Bayesian methods; the relative public health
impact of false-negative and false-positive
findings; the database being mined; dictionary
architecture; resource limitations; and the
number of drugs and events being monitored. It
is quite likely that the incremental utility of data
mining algorithms may be higher for health
authorities and large transnational drug
monitoring centers with mandates to monitor the
safety of all licensed products within their jurisdiction, compared with individual pharmaceutical
companies, whose surveillance responsibilities
are more focused in scope.
Three factors influenced the choice of the
drug-event combinations for this analysis: the
medical importance of these events, the presence
of spontaneous reports in the AERS database
before the respective labeling amendments, and
the publication of an expert case-level clinical
assessment by investigators from the FDA,
National Institutes of Health, and a major
academic center that supported the association
described in the case reports. 1 However, the
sample of drug-event combinations examined
represents a tiny fraction of possible reported
drug-event combinations. This nonsystematic
example cannot be used to draw inferences about
the overall performance characteristics of this
technique. We evaluated one data mining
strategy or configuration (i.e., data mined on the
MedDRA preferred terms). Enhancements to
such data mining algorithms include the ability
to create customized data mining search
categories. It is possible that there are data
mining strategies and configurations that could
result in enhanced performance relative to the
use of preferred adverse-event terms. For
example, future versions of data mining algorithms
will allow users to combine the various MedDRA
preferred terms into a single adverse-event item
variable. This could enhance performance by
increasing the effective case counts, although the
precise effect partly would depend on the
particular coding practices applied to reports of
the drug-event combinations of interest, as well
as to reports of the relevant events with other drugs.
Conclusion
These findings illustrate the need to obtain a
clearer understanding of the capabilities and
limitations of data mining algorithms before we
can recommend them for routine use in all
pharmacovigilance settings. The findings also

APPLICATION OF AN EMPIRIC BAYESIAN DATA MINING ALGORITHM Hauben
suggest that the reliability of data mining
algorithms for making comparative safety
assessments is not established. They further
suggest that these types of algorithms should not
be used as a stand-alone method for screening
adverse drug reaction databases and that they
cannot replace traditional rule-based methods of
signal detection in pharmacovigilance. These
promising tools should be considered only as
supplements to, and not as substitutes for, a
comprehensive pharmacovigilance program that
utilizes multiple approaches and knowledge
domains to detect signals of adverse drug reactions.

gradients between simple forms of disproportionality analysis (e.g., proportional reporting
ratios) and empiric Bayesian algorithms (e.g.,
MGPS). This question was addressed briefly in
the discussion section of this manuscript, and
readers may be interested in the following
interval findings: using proportional reporting
ratios with commonly cited thresholds, a signal
of disproportionate reporting of pancreatitis
would have been observed for one of the atypical
antipsychotics 5 years before the event was listed
in the annual Physicians’ Desk Reference and 2
years before the first MEDLINE-indexed
published case report.
When commonly cited thresholds are used, the
higher “sensitivity” and lower “specificity” of
simple forms of disproportionality analysis are
associated with an overabundance of signals,
including false-positive signals not reflective of
causality that may require additional triage
criteria for practical implementation. Performance
gradients between data mining algorithms, when
used in isolation, are important to bear in mind,
but it is likely that such differentials will be
mitigated when these valuable tools are used as
one component of a comprehensive pharmacovigilance program that utilizes multiple
approaches to signal detection.
