Background: Allergen immunotherapy (AIT) treatment for
allergic rhinitis and asthma is used by 2.6 million Americans
annually. Clinical and sterility testing studies identify no risk of
contamination or infection from extracts prepared using
recommended aseptic techniques, but regulatory concerns
persist. Social media can be used to investigate rare adverse
effects not captured by traditional studies.
Objective: We sought to investigate large social media databases
for suggestion of AIT skin and soft tissue infection (SSTI) risk
and compare this risk to a comparator procedure with a sterile
pharmaceutical.
Methods: We analyzed US-restricted data from more than 10
common text-based social media platforms including Facebook,
Twitter, and Reddit between 2012 and 2016. We used natural
language processing (NLP) to identify posts related to AIT and,
separately, influenza vaccination (comparator procedure). NLP
was followed by manual review to identify posts suggesting a
possible SSTI associated with either AIT or influenza
vaccination. SSTI frequencies with 95% CIs were compared.
Results: We identified 25,126 AIT posts, which were matched by
social media platform to 25,126 influenza vaccination–related
posts. NLP identified 4088 (16.3%) AIT posts that required
manual review, with 6 posts (0.02%; 95% CI, 0.005%-0.043%)
indicative of possible AIT-related SSTI. NLP identified 2689
(10.7%) influenza posts that required manual review, with 7
posts (0.03%; 95% CI, 0.007%-0.048%) indicative of possible
influenza vaccination–related SSTI.

Conclusions: Social media data suggest that SSTI from AIT and
influenza vaccination are equally rare events. Given that AIT’s SSTI
risk appears comparable to the risk using a sterile pharmaceutical
based on social media data, current aseptic technique procedures
seem safe. (J Allergy Clin Immunol 2019;144:129-34.)

Allergic rhinitis affects from 10% to 30% of the adult US
population and accounts for more than 17 million US health care
visits annually.1,2 Although over-the-counter and prescription
medications are available for allergic rhinitis symptomatic treatment, allergen immunotherapy (AIT) (ie, allergy ‘‘shots’’) is the
primary immunomodulatory treatment modality, is associated
with long-term clinical benefit, and is cost-effective.3,4 AIT is
administered to approximately 2.6 million Americans in more
than 16 million injections annually.5,6 AIT treatments have
been in clinical use for more than 100 years and are typically prepared by allergy practices following an aseptic technique.
Regulatory bodies help to ensure patient safety; however,
recent lapses in sterile compounding practices led to infections
and patient harm, posing measurable threats to public health.7,8
The United States Pharmacopeia is a regulatory body that has
considered compounding guidelines that would require AIT
change from aseptic technique to sterile technique. Although
such a change was being considered to reduce infection risk, it
was hypothesized that this change in preparation would result
in an increased risk of allergic reactions, reduced efficacy of
AIT, and marked restrictions to AIT access.9
To date, AIT sterility studies have failed to identify a measurable
risk of contamination in extracts prepared using recommended
aseptic techniques.10-13 Retrospective clinical studies of patients
undergoing AIT have similarly not found any evidence of infection
risk from AIT.6,14 There are no case reports of AIT-induced infections in the medical literature.6 Social media data are increasingly
being used to investigate rare adverse reactions, including those
not easily identifiable with traditional research methods. Previous
social media studies have assessed adverse drug reactions and
adverse events after immunization.15,16 In this study, we used large
social media data to investigate skin and soft tissue infection (SSTI)
risk associated with AITand, separately, with a comparator procedure with a sterilely produced pharmaceutical, influenza vaccination.

extract large volumes of web content from health-related websites (eg,
weightwatchers.com), social media (eg, Facebook, Twitter, and Reddit), forums (eg, forums.thebump.com), and blogs. Their database, freely available
on their website, includes more than 2 billion users’ discussions, reflective
of more than 40,000 medications and medical conditions.
Within Treato’s database, data are analyzed using a patented algorithm
(patent #US 8,612,455 B2) that applies natural language processing (NLP) to
online free-text discussions. NLP is a subfield of computer science that uses
computers to process human (natural) language.17 NLP has been used in medicine and clinical research to process and analyze large amounts of free-text
documents, such as clinical notes/reports and social media posts.18,19 Treato’s
analysis engine combines a diverse range of medical ontologies, organized in a
concept-based structure and coded similarly to the Unified Medical Language
System (UMLS),20 and patient language vocabulary for concept extraction
and analysis. Among the ontologies used is the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities,21 which is used by the US Food and Drug Administration for
adverse drug reaction term coding. These ontologies provide a set of terms to
extract relevant concepts from free text and their internal hierarchical structure, which is used for grouping and aggregation. Synonymous terms (eg, ‘‘allergy shot’’ and ‘‘allergy desensitization’’) are assigned the same ontology
code, whereas ambiguous terms (eg, abbreviations such as ‘‘AIT’’ that could
mean ‘‘allergen immunotherapy’’ or ‘‘advanced individual training’’) have
multiple candidate codes from which only 1 code is chosen using an ambiguity
resolver component within Treato’s algorithm.
In this study, we considered social media posts generating only from the
United States (as designated on the basis of internet protocol address) from
January 1, 2012, through December 31, 2016.
AIT social media data set. After extracting 18 unique AIT
synonym terms (Concept UMLS ID: C0162352) from the UMLS,20 such as
‘‘desensitization to allergens’’ or ‘‘desensitizing immunotherapy,’’ we
expanded the AIT vocabulary by adding synonyms based on clinical expertise,
common misspellings (eg, ‘‘alergy’’), and lexical variants (eg, plurals ‘‘immunotherapies’’). We manually reviewed a random subset of 1000 social media
posts where words such as ‘‘allergy’’/‘‘allergen’’ and ‘‘shots’’/‘‘injections’’ appeared together to determine whether any key synonyms were missed. This
process notably did not identify any new synonyms. The final list of 33 query
terms (Table I) was used to extract social media posts from Treato’s database,
resulting in an AIT sample consisting of 25,126 social media posts.
Influenza vaccination social media data set. To generate
a comparison sample of social media reports on influenza vaccination, we used
Treato’s existing terminology list of influenza vaccination synonyms (eg, ‘‘flu
shot/s,’’ ‘‘flu jab’’; n 5 428,832 posts). Given the high volume of influenza
posts, we restricted the sample by matching posts to the AIT sample. To create
this matched sample, we first randomly extracted the same number of posts for
each one of the top 10 most common websites in the AIT sample; the
remaining posts were randomly chosen from other websites with social media
reports of influenza vaccination.
Skin and soft tissue infections. To identify potential SSTIs,
we compiled a list of reactions and indicators suggestive of SSTI and other
effects, based on clinical experience and literature review (Table II).22-24
SSTIs were defined as the presence of signs of bacterial or other epidermal
or dermal infection related to the administration of AIT or influenza vaccination. We distinguished between reports that contained (1) mentions of potential SSTI (eg, impetigo, folliculitis, furuncles/carbuncles, and cellulitis); (2)
mentions of other infection signs or symptoms (eg, words like ‘‘infection/s,’’
‘‘fever,’’ ‘‘leukocytosis,’’ and ‘‘delirium’’); and (3) mentions of potential
SSTI treatment or service use (eg, antibiotics and expressions such as ‘‘hospitalization’’ or ‘‘emergency room [ER]’’). We also investigated mentions of

common and expected local reactions to AIT (eg, redness, swelling, and
itch at the injection site). Searches were implemented using regular expressions in R statistical software (R Foundation for Statistical Programming,
Vienna, Austria).25
Each post containing potential AIT or influenza vaccination–related SSTI,
treatments, or service use was manually reviewed. All posts describing
symptoms that were possibly an SSTI were reviewed by 2 internists and
allergist-immunologists with a consensus achieved.
We compared possible SSTIs, and other symptoms, between AIT and
influenza vaccine by determining frequencies with exact (ie, Clopper Pearson)
95% CIs in SAS version 9.4 (Cary, NC). We determined the precision of our
methodology, the fraction of relevant instances among the retrieved
instances.26
The research protocol was reviewed and deemed exempt by the Partners
Human Research Committee.

RESULTS
We identified 25,126 AIT posts, which were matched by social
media platform to 25,126 influenza vaccine posts (Table III).
NLP identified 4088 AIT posts (16.2%) that required manual
review. The most common term used to describe AIT in social
media was ‘‘allergy shot’’ and its lexical variations (eg, plurals
and misspellings). There were 6 posts (0.02%; 95% CI, 0.005%0.043%) indicative of possible AIT-related SSTI (Table IV). Of
the 6 possible SSTI posts, 4 included the terms ‘‘infection’’ or
‘‘cellulitis’’ (Fig 1, A). Two posts were included for possibly
describing an SSTI: the first patient described symptoms most
consistent with a large local reaction from AIT, although because
antibiotics were prescribed, investigators included it as a possible
SSTI. The other post described a high fever, a hot itchy swollen
arm, and cough, included as a possible SSTI, but may have
been an allergic reaction to AIT or a respiratory infection.
NLP identified 2689 influenza posts (10.7% of total matched
posts) that required manual review, with 7 posts (0.03%; 95% CI,
0.007%-0.048%) indicative of possible influenza vaccination–
related SSTI. These 7 posts described SSTIs using terms
including ‘‘infection’’ (n 5 4) or ‘‘cellulitis’’ (n 5 3; Fig 1, B).

Slightly more than 1% of posts (n 5 279) described other local
or systemic reactions to AIT, commonly local swelling (0.32%;
95% CI, 0.252%-0.392%), hospital service use (0.29%; 95% CI,
0.228%-0.362%), and skin redness (0.24%; 95% CI, 0.182%0.304%; Table IV). Other infection indicators were uncommonly
described, largely fever (0.02% [95% CI, 0.002%-0.037%] for
AIT and 0.35% [95% CI, 0.274%-0.419%] for influenza vaccination). All related side effects were identified in 1.13% (95% CI,
1.003%-1.265%) of AIT posts, compared with 1.35% (95% CI,
1.203%-1.488%) of influenza posts.
Frequencies of AIT signs and symptoms of interest were all
comparable to those observed with influenza vaccination, with the
exceptions of itch, which was more common with AIT (0.22%
[95% CI, 0.161%-0.277%] vs 0.04% [95% CI, 0.018%-0.070%]
for influenza vaccination), and fever, which was more common
with influenza vaccination (0.35% [95% CI, 0.274%-0.419%] vs
0.02% [95% CI, 0.002%-0.037%] for AIT).
Our NLP approach achieved 7% precision (285 of 4088
potential AIT-related SSTI and other events identified by NLP
were confirmed) in identifying AIT-related side effects and 12.6%
precision (338 of 2689 potential influenza vaccination–related
SSTI and other events identified by NLP were confirmed) in
identifying influenza vaccination–related side effects reported in
the social media. Irrelevant posts included posts about other
allergic conditions (eg, food allergies and atopic dermatitis) and
posts mentioning AIT/influenza vaccination in other contexts (eg,
medical personnel described unwillingness to undergo mandatory
influenza vaccination).

DISCUSSION
In this study, we analyzed large US-restricted public text–based
social media data from sites including Facebook, Twitter, and
Reddit, with the aim of discovering rare adverse events less likely
to be identified by traditional research methods. We identified
mentions of symptoms consistent with SSTI that the poster
associated with AIT, a procedure prepared using aseptic technique, or influenza administration, a procedure using a sterile
pharmaceutical. In total, only 6 of 25,126 posts related to AIT

posts related to influenza vaccination described a possible

described other local or systemic reactions from each procedure.
We identified a small number of posts describing a possible
AIT-related SSTI using informatics methods (0.02%; 95% CI,
0.005%-0.043%). This study confirms findings to date from
traditional studies that have found a negligible risk of infection for
patients receiving AIT.6,10-12,14 Specifically, 1 previous retrospective study of 272 patients on AIT did not identify a single patient
with SSTI from AIT, nor any patient with a fever, discharge from
the injection site, or cellulitis.14 Our previous study used clinical
use data to identify potential AIT-related infections, and of
136,322 separate AIT administration episodes over a 10-year
period at 2 academic medical centers, no infectious complications
of AIT were identified.6 However, previous data relied on patients
reporting the symptoms to their clinician in follow-up14 or
seeking medical care for adverse symptoms within the same
health system.6 Thus, it was plausible that infections existed but

were not being identified through these traditional research
methods. As such, we used advanced informatics methods on
large amounts of social media data over 5 years to detect rare signals not easily identifiable in clinical studies.27-29 Our methods
identified a few reports of possible SSTIs from AIT and influenza
vaccine, data that support that both procedures pose no meaningful infection risk.
The frequency with which we observed AIT-related posts that
suggest a potential associated SSTI and the frequency with which
we identified influenza vaccination–related posts that suggest a
potential associated SSTI were almost identical, with overlapping
CIs. This consistency suggests that the observed frequencies are
comparable despite their preparation differences and that aseptic
technique should not be a concern for treating allergists, patients
on AIT, or regulatory bodies. Given other potential consequences
predicted should substantial changes to AIT preparation be
recommended by a regulatory body, including a contracted AIT
supply, as well as consequences from changing the beyond-use
date (eg, increased allergic reactions),9 allergen extract preparation need not be changed under a guise of improving patient safety
without thorough consideration of these data.
Surprisingly, slightly fewer local or systemic reactions were
reported in AIT-related posts than were reported in influenza
vaccination–related posts. As with any treatment, both AIT and
influenza vaccinations may result in unintended side effects; in
sum, side effects investigated comprised just 1.13% of AIT posts
and 1.35% of influenza vaccination posts. This finding supports
the large body of existing literature on the tolerability of AIT for
the treatment of patients with allergic rhinitis and allergic asthma.
Furthermore, social media posts described swelling, redness, and
exudate with similar frequency for both injections. Notably, itch
was the only symptom significantly more common for AIT than
for influenza vaccination, and fever was the only symptom
significantly more common for influenza vaccination than for
AIT.
Our study has notable limitations. First, it is possible that
adverse events from an injection might be underreported on
social media, even on health-related sites. However, data
suggest that adverse drug reactions reported on social media
generally align with those reported in the electronic health
record, and rare events are more prevalent in social media than
in the electronic health record.27 We could not study all social
media data and could not study private posts. Nonetheless, we

used large amounts of social media data from numerous social
media sites that included the most common text-based platforms
Facebook, Twitter, and Reddit. Because frequencies of USrestricted social media posts do not correlate with epidemiology
estimates of prevalence and incidence, we used a matching process by which we were able to compare AIT SSTI-observed
frequencies to influenza vaccine SSTI-observed frequencies.
Although a new approach, our methodology was shown to
have validity given that we were able to identify the expected
findings of itch being more common for AIT and fever being
more common in influenza vaccination. Still, there is no perfect
AIT comparator; influenza vaccination posts contained messages about involuntary vaccination and general antivaccination
sentiment. Despite using random sampling for the comparator
group posts, the sample represented less than 10% of influenza
posts, and may not have been representative. Although NLP was
used to mine social media data and find potential SSTI-related
posts, it is possible that the search terms and algorithms missed
posts that were actual matches. However, our NLP method used
a broad set of key words designed to be inclusive and capture all
possible relevant mentions, and reassuringly, the algorithms detected many possibly relevant cases and cases where the text
was suggestive of an infection in both AIT and influenza vaccination data sets. It is possible that more cases may have been
identified with a manual review; however, manual review of
52,000 posts would not be feasible and, practically, could be
subject to more error (eg, natural human error) as much as
NLP algorithms. Although we aimed to study conventional
AIT, we may have captured another injection for allergies that
the patient interpreted as an ‘‘allergy shot’’ (eg, neutralizationprovocation therapy and Rinkel technique).23 Although the
most prevalent method to prepare AIT in the United States is
aseptic technique, the preparation method of AIT could not be
discerned from social media posts and other preparation
methods (eg, sterile technique) might have been possible.
Although we reviewed several random subsamples of the social
media posts that did not include SSTI-related keywords (and did
find additional SSTI-related posts), we cannot calculate NLP
recall in a reliable manner. In addition, social media posters
are likely younger patients more familiar with technology.
Finally, although it is possible that SSTIs were reported by
the same person on different websites under different user
names, reviewers considered the positive events distinct.

FIG 1. Social media posts with possible SSTIs due to AIT (A) and influenza vaccinations (B). ER, Emergency
room; MRI, magnetic resonance imaging. *This post likely represents a large local reaction, but was
included as an SSTI because antibiotics were given. This post may describe infectious symptoms unrelated to the allergy shot, but symptoms may describe a cellulitis or an upper respiratory tract infection.

Mining of social media data suggests that suspected infections
from AIT, prepared with aseptic technique, are rare, as rare as
suspected infections from influenza vaccination, a sterile

pharmaceutical. Current AIT preparation guidelines do not
appear to pose an infectious risk to patients, as previously
determined in translational and clinical studies, and now

134 BLUMENTHAL ET AL

confirmed in an informatics study. AIT safety efforts should focus
on operational improvements to prevent, diagnose, and treat the
allergic reactions that predictably complicate the administration
of this effective treatment for allergic rhinitis and asthma.
Clinical implications: Current preparation guidelines for
allergen immunotherapy do not pose an infectious risk to
patients.
