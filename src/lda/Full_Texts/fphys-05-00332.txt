Purpose: New pharmacovigilance methods are needed as a consequence of the morbidity
caused by drugs. We exploit fine-grained drug related adverse event information extracted
by text mining from electronic medical records (EMRs) to stratify patients based on their
adverse events and to determine adverse event co-occurrences.
Methods: We analyzed the similarity of adverse event profiles of 2347 patients extracted
from EMRs from a mental health center in Denmark. The patients were clustered based
on their adverse event profiles and the similarities were presented as a network. The set
of adverse events in each main patient cluster was evaluated. Co-occurrences of adverse
events in patients (p-value < 0.01) were identified and presented as well.
Results: We found that each cluster of patients typically had a most distinguishing
adverse event. Examination of the co-occurrences of adverse events in patients led to
the identification of potentially interesting adverse event correlations that may be further
investigated as well as provide further patient stratification opportunities.
Conclusions: We have demonstrated the feasibility of a novel approach in
pharmacovigilance to stratify patients based on fine-grained adverse event profiles, which
also makes it possible to identify adverse event correlations. Used on larger data sets,
this data-driven method has the potential to reveal unknown patterns concerning adverse
event occurrences.

INTRODUCTION
Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) have been reported to be
directly responsible for more than 5% of all hospitalizations
(Pirmohamed et al., 2004; Kongkaew et al., 2008) and add considerably to the morbidity of patients and the cost of healthcare
(Rottenkolber et al., 2012). Therefore, new methods for analyzing
adverse event (AE) trends and for identifying causal relationships
to determine ADRs are of considerable importance (Wang et al.,
2009; Coloma et al., 2012; Harpaz et al., 2012, 2013; Eriksson
et al., 2013). Such knowledge is essential for providing more
informed medical care and thereby in particular preventing ADRs
(Landmark and Johannessen, 2012; Yusof and Hua, 2012).
We have developed a method for analyzing AEs based on a
data mining approach for elucidating patterns of patient-specific
AE occurrences. The approach exploits phenotypic information
in the clinical narratives of electronic medical records (EMRs).

There is currently major focus on employing EMRs for pharmacovigilance due to the limited scope of clinical trials and the need
for complementing spontaneous reporting systems (McClellan,
2007; Coloma et al., 2012; Harpaz et al., 2012; Eriksson et al.,
2014).
Clinical trials are limited in size and characteristics of the
patient cohorts included in the studies, and further limited by
the duration of the trial (Harpaz et al., 2012). Spontaneous
reporting systems, the current principal method for pharmacovigilance (Avery et al., 2011; Harpaz et al., 2012), are inherently biased and suffer from incomplete data, under-reporting
of AEs (Hazell and Shakir, 2006), and over-reporting of ADRs
that receive media attention (Harpaz et al., 2012). Moreover,
the traditional methods within pharmacovigilance have in several cases led to the discovery of critical ADRs only after several
years on the market for a given drug (Kälviäinen and Nousiainen,
2001; McClellan, 2007). As the implementation of EMRs is developing rapidly (Kierkegaard, 2011; Hatton et al., 2012), large
amounts of phenotypic data are systematically and automatically
recorded in a population-wide fashion. Data mining of information contained in EMRs has the potential to identify ADRs earlier

(Brownstein et al., 2007), improve prevalence measurements of
AEs (Coloma et al., 2011; LePendu et al., 2013), and to create the
basis for obtaining better understanding of AEs, which may help
guide clinical decision making to improve patient safety (Jensen
et al., 2012).
EMRs typically contain both structured data and clinical narratives, where the latter represent free text authored by healthcare
staff. The use of EMRs for pharmacovigilance research has so
far mainly been based on structured data (Coloma et al., 2011).
However, it has been suggested that up to 90% of AEs are recorded
only in the clinical narratives (Classen et al., 2011; Roque et al.,
2011; Haerian et al., 2012). Hence, more AEs will be captured
through extraction by natural language processing (Meystre et al.,
2008; Eriksson et al., 2013; LePendu et al., 2013).
Specialized ADR terminologies and dictionaries such as
the WHO Adverse Reactions Terminology (WHO-ART) (The
Uppsala Monitoring Centre, 2014) and the Medical Dictionary
for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) (Brown et al., 1999) have
unfortunately not been translated into all languages, including
Danish or any other Nordic language. When performing AE
extraction in a language like Danish it is therefore relevant and
necessary to construct novel, aggregated dictionaries to handle comprehensive, specific AEs and capture more fine-grained
information in the clinical narratives (Eriksson et al., 2013).
While most research focused on a few selected AEs or drugs
(Trifirò et al., 2009; Wang et al., 2009; Haerian et al., 2012), we
aimed to analyze the full spectrum of AEs described in EMRs.
Analyzing all AEs present in EMRs additionally reflects actual
drug use in heterogeneous populations. Several traditional methods analyzing AEs rely on spontaneous reporting systems such
as the US FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS), the
European Economic Area collaboration Eudravigilance and the
WHO VigiBase. However, such reporting systems may suffer from
over-reporting of ADRs for drugs with known and published
ADRs, under-reporting of unknown ADRs (the causal link is not
identified), and otherwise missing or incomplete data (Harpaz
et al., 2012). As there is no preconception in EMRs around which
AEs to expect, the resulting information is likely to be less biased
compared to the information gathered in large databases of spontaneous reporting systems. This possibly allows discovering new
and unexpected findings concerning AEs.
We have developed a patient-stratification scheme based on a
data mining approach for elucidating patterns of patient-specific
AE occurrences. The extracted AEs are subsequently analyzed in
terms of their co-occurrences across a patient cohort.
The strategy presented here for exploring AEs relies partially
on network analysis, which describes topological and quantitative relationships between either AEs, patients, or drugs. In recent
years, the use of networks has increased in biomedical research
(Barabási et al., 2011) to explore complex interrelated systems
e.g., to identify novel disease proteins or genes associated with
a given phenotype (Lage et al., 2007, 2010) as well as proteins
related to ADRs (Huang et al., 2011; Chen et al., 2013). Networks
have also been used extensively to better understand the structure of diseasomes, including co-morbidity analyses (Goh et al.,
2007; Hidalgo et al., 2009; Barabási et al., 2011; Roque et al.,
2011). Similarly, in this work we use networks as they represent

Patient specific drug-related AE correlations

an excellent method of exploring and understanding data sets
of extreme dimensionality, with thousands of AEs and millions
of potential AE-AE pairs. We use the technique to study and
provide a cohort-wide overview of the co-occurrences of AEs in
same individuals to reveal potentially interesting interdependencies between AEs. Patients may be stratified according to their AE
profiles and the AE-AE correlations the patients encounter.
The method presented here has been employed on EMRs
from a Danish mental health center. Many patients with psychiatric disorders need to strike a balance between efficacy and
safety. This is because the disorders are so severe that a fair
number of ADRs are accepted during treatment (Bender et al.,
2004; Muench and Hamer, 2010; Jain et al., 2011; Landmark
and Johannessen, 2012). As the use of e.g., neuroleptics is nearly
always life long, the importance of pharmacovigilance within
psychiatry is emphasized. We present a method, which scales
to larger data sets and patient populations. The method is also
well-suited for further integration of findings with genetic, proteomic, and pathway data as well as existing chemoinformatics
knowledge relating to the drugs that cause the ADRs when administered to patients. A possible way to perform such analysis is to
map AEs to OMIM and create protein-protein interaction networks, in a similar way as previously described (Roque et al.,
2011).

METHODS
ETHICS STATEMENT

AE co-occurrences were analyzed based on de-identified data. The
project was ethically approved by the Danish National Board of
Health (J. nr. 7-604-04-2/33/EHE).
PATIENT CORPUS

The EMRs employed in this study are from a Danish mental health center and hold data from 6011 patients collected
between 1998 and 2010, and therefore contain extensive longitudinal data on many patients. Both structured and unstructured EMR data were used. The clinical narratives were used
for extracting AEs by text mining, while the structured data
was used for obtaining precise information concerning drug
identities (using the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical, ATC, system), drug dosages, prescription intervals, and diagnoses (using
International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision, ICD10).
It was identified that 3394 patients were prescribed at least one
drug while 2347 patients had at least one AE. The gender ratio
for patients consuming at least one drug was 1:2 female to male,
while it is 2:3 for patients that have at least one AE. The prescribed
number of drugs to the population with at least one AE was at an
average of 15.4 with standard deviation of 9.4 per patient. The
mental health center investigates and treats patients who suffer
from severe mental illnesses, and the center also has a ward for
forensic psychiatry. It is therefore not representative of a general population. The disease distributions have previously been
described elsewhere (Roque et al., 2011). Hence, it is important
to interpret the results in the appropriate context of a mentally
ill population and with forensic hospitalizations. However, the
method presented is not in any way limited to this particular
indication area.

EXTRACTION OF ADVERSE EVENTS

The AE text mining extraction from the clinical narratives is
elsewhere described in detail (Eriksson et al., 2013, 2014). The
method relied on a Danish dictionary of AEs constructed based
on the undesirable effects section from the summary of product
characteristics of 7446 drugs marketed in Denmark. In all, 21,342
uniquely spelled ADRs from the summary of product characteristics were used to construct an initial ADR dictionary, which was
further condensed in different ways. ADR terms were coordinated
post-extraction based on a class system and synonymous terms
or terms with the same medical implementation were merged.
The extracted terms were filtered in order to find only true possibly drug related AEs e.g., by eliminating (i) negated concepts or
mentioning of other subjects, (ii) information given to the patient
about possible undesirable effects or events that the patient previously experienced, (iii) symptoms that are an indication for
the drug, (iv) potential ADRs that are from sentences with two
or more drugs, as this was likely to be medical history or information to the patient, and (v) pre-existing conditions that the
patients had prior to intake of the drug and experienced during treatment. A temporal data mining approach was used that
combined the terms with information from structured data of
prescription period and prescribed drug dosage (Eriksson et al.,
2014). The approach identified 75% of the total possible drug
related adverse events (recall/sensitivity) and in 95% of the cases
the identified AEs were actual possible drug related adverse events
(precision/positive predictive value). The validation was carried
out by comparing with manual inspection of a sample of 200
randomly selected patient notes (Eriksson et al., 2014). The dictionary employed in this research underwent slight modifications
to become the final version described by Eriksson et al.
OVERVIEW OF METHODS FOR DATA ANALYSIS

The methods presented in this paper are summarized in Table 1.
Further detail is provided in the following sections.
PATIENT STRATIFICATION

Patients were represented by vectors in a space of 1190 AE dimensions. The values for each AE in the vector were term-frequency
inverse document frequency (tf-idf) weighted values in order to
correct for how strongly a patient was associated with a given
AE. The tf-idf is a statistical technique to determine how common a term is to a document in a corpus (Robertson and Spärck

Jones, 1976). The method takes into account how many times the
term appears in a patient’s medical history (term frequency) and
the prevalence of the term in the whole corpus (document frequency). In this study, a normalized value of term frequency was
calculated by dividing the number of times a specific AE term
appears in a patient’s medical history with the number of times all
AE terms appear. This was done to prevent bias toward patients
with longer clinical narratives. The tf-idf is defined by:
tfidf =

 
f
N
· ln
F
n

where f is the number of times a given AE term appears in the
EMR, F is the number of times all AE terms appear in the patient’s
medical history, N is the total number of patients, and n is the
number of patients that have the specific AE.
The patients were stratified using the cosine dissimilarity measure to quantify the distance between their vectors in the AE
space. The cosine dissimilarity is one minus the cosine of the angle
between the two vectors:
cosine dissimilarity = 1 − cos (θ) = 1 −

a·b
||a|| ||b||

The cosine dissimilarity measure has the advantage of being independent of the length of the vector, meaning that in spite of two
patients not having the same number of AEs they may still be
compared meaningfully. This method is a measure commonly
used in the literature when handling phenotype vectors (Lage
et al., 2007; Chan et al., 2011; Roque et al., 2011).
Patients were clustered by average linkage hierarchical clustering. A cutoff was set at a cosine dissimilarity value of 0.6 after
manual inspection of the clustering dendrogram. This yielded
720 clusters in total where 45 contained 10 patients or more
accounting for 976 patients.
In order to investigate the clinical characteristics of the patients
in the clusters three new tf-idf vectors were constructed per cluster containing (1) the AEs, (2) the drugs associated to the AEs,
and (3) the diagnoses. The tf-idf vectors were calculated for the
merged EMRs of all the patients in a cluster. In order to better
compare values between vectors a characteristic scale with values
from 0 to 1 was introduced, which was the fraction that each AE
composed out of the vector sum.

Patient specific drug-related AE correlations

CO-OCCURRENCE OF ADVERSE EVENTS

Every distance measure has a bias that over- or under-estimates
relationships between rare or prevalent elements. Results should
always be interpreted bearing in mind that the method is
decisive for the results observed. For the purpose of ensuring that results of detected co-occurrences in AEs are consistent independently of the method used, two methods were
used for evaluating associations between elements, namely finding a co-occurrence score and calculating weighted edges. In
total there were 707,455 ((11902 –1190)/2) possible AE pairs
and the two mentioned methods identified the most relevant
ones.
Co-occurrence score

First, a co-occurrence score was calculated reflecting how often
a pair of AEs occurs in a patient with regard to what could
be expected, a common method for quantifying co-morbidities
(Hidalgo et al., 2009; Roque et al., 2011). The number of patients
that are affected by both AE A and B, Obs = nAB , is divided by
the expected number of observations, which is the product of
the number of patients that are affected by A and B divided by
the total number of patients Expt = nA nB /ntot . To favor pairs of
low prevalence AEs less, a pseudo-count of 1 was added to the
nominator and denominator. The co-occurrence score is given by:

co − occurence score = log2

Obs + 1
Expt + 1




= log2

nAB + 1
nA nB
ntot + 1



Second, the most significantly associated AE pairs were found by
calculating a p-value for each AE pair by Fisher’s exact test. The
test was performed for each pair of AEs (A and B) on four groups
of patients: A and B, A not B, B not A, and not A not B divided
according to whether the patients were affected by the AEs. We
used the Benjamini and Hochberg method to correct for multiple
testing (Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995). The p-value s from the
Fisher’s exact test were ordered and each value was multiplied by
the number of tests and divided by the rank that the AE pair had
in the ordered list. Only pairs with a corrected p-value below a
cutoff of 0.01 were selected.

For identifying the most significant associations of out the possible AE pairs, the multiscale backbone was extracted from the
network. This approach tests every weighted edge value from AE i
against an expected value produced by a random assignment from
a uniform distribution. The formula used to calculate the p-value
of an edge from AE i to AE j is given by:


pij

αij = 1 − (k − 1) ∗

(1 − x)k−2 dx

0

where k is number of edges from AE i, x is a particular value
that the weight can assume, pij is the weighted edge from AE i
to AE j, normalized by dividing
 with the sum of all edges from
AEi: pij = weighted edgeij / j weighted edgeij (the fraction that
this edge represents out of the sum of all edges from AE i). If the
p-value was below a significance level α of 0.01, the association
between the two AEs was significant.
AE co-occurrence score visualization

To ease visualization a rough division of AEs into anatomical
areas was performed. As the terms cannot be directly linked to
the ICD10 system, because the precise AE terms do not appear in
the ICD10 dictionary, this division was performed manually and
was merely inspired by the ICD10 classification.

RESULTS
STATISTICS OF THE DATA

When applying the text mining pipeline on the clinical narratives
it was determined that the EMRs contained 2347 patients affected
by at least one AE. Taken together, these patients had 1190 unique
AEs, on average 5.2 AEs per patient (Figure 1), and 10.3 patients

The methods employed in this second analysis are described in
detail elsewhere (Barrat et al., 2004; Serrano et al., 2009) and are
briefly presented here. The associations between AEs were based
on which patients they affect. The strength of the association
between AEs was given by the weighted edge, which is the sum of
the number of patients that had both of the compared AEs normalized by the number of AEs that affected the given patient. The
weighted edge between AE i and AE j was defined as:

per AE (Figure 2). The maximal number of AEs per patient was
48, while 22% of patients were affected by only one AE identified
by text mining. Moreover, 48% of AEs affected only one patient.
PATIENT STRATIFICATION

Each patient was represented by a vector in the space of AEs,
reflecting the AE profile of the patient. The network shown in
Figure 3 is a spatial representation of the associations between
patients, reflecting to what extent their AE profiles display similarity. Patients are colored according to which cluster they belong,
following the result of the hierarchical clustering. Only clusters
with 10 or more patients (45 clusters in total) have been included
in the figure, which yielded a network of 976 patients and 45
clusters. The clusters with the smallest numbers are the largest
clusters, for example cluster 1 has 122 patients and cluster 45, 10
patients.
Cluster adverse events

The nature of the patient stratification is further illustrated when
coupled to the cluster characteristics in terms of which AEs the
patients of each cluster have (Figure 4).
From Figure 4, it is evident that all clusters have one AE that
stands out as the most distinguishing AE for this cluster. None of
the 45 clusters share the same most distinguishing AE. The most
distinguishing AE constitutes more than 20% of the sum of the
tf-idf values in the AE vector of each cluster except cluster 42. For
example “sedation” is the most distinguishing AE of the patients
in cluster 1 as it accounts for 40% of the tf-idf vector sum. The
AEs that are the most distinguishing for the patients in the clusters are also the most prevalent AEs at the mental health center.
This can be concluded from the observation that the AEs on the

www.frontiersin.org

heat map of Figure 4 are ordered according to prevalence and the
first 18 on the list (from “sedation” to “headache”) are also the
18 most prevalent AEs at the center. Patients at the periphery of
the network have more distinct AE profiles than patients in the
center of the network. In general, Figure 3 shows that the largest
clusters (clusters 1–6) gather in the center of the network while
clusters with fewer patients are at the periphery (e.g., clusters 38,
42, and 45). This is likely because the most distinguishing AEs of
the largest clusters are in general also the most prevalent ones and
many patients from other clusters are also affected by those AEs.
In addition to the most distinguishing AE, many of the clusters also have a second AE that represents a fairly large fraction
(5–10%) of the tf-idf vector sum. This indicates that there is
some level of systematic co-occurrence of AEs. For example, the
most distinguishing AE of the patients of cluster 23 is “weight
gain” accounting for 58% of the tf-idf vector sum while “appetite
increase” constitutes 5.4%. Also, the patients of cluster 30 share
many AEs: “stiffness” 28.3%, “tremor” 5.7%, and “cramp” 5.1%.
The patients of cluster 35 have “dry mouth” as the most distinguishing AE accounting for 30% of the tf-idf vector sum while
“restless” constitutes 11%. These trends are further investigated
through a co-occurrence analysis described below.
The AEs of each cluster were analyzed further by including
not only the most distinguishing AE of each cluster but also
the second most distinguishing AE, presented in a heat map in
Figure 5. It is evident that for all clusters, the most distinguishing AE constitutes a much larger fraction of the tf-idf vector sum
than the second most (on average 8.2 times larger). It can thereby
be inferred that the stratification is effective and it might be reasonable to consider the patients in a cluster as representatives of
the most distinguishing AE of this cluster. Moreover, only 10 new
AEs are added to the list of AEs, which indicates that only 10 of
the clusters have a second most distinguishing AE that is not the
most distinguishing AE of another cluster.
Cluster specific drugs

Taking the most distinguishing drug that caused the AEs that
affect the patients in each of the 45 clusters (i.e., the drug with
the largest tf-idf fraction) yielded a vector of 23 ATC level 5
drugs. Thus, some drugs are the main cause for the AEs of several
clusters. When including the two largest tf-idf fractions, a vector
of 32 ATC level 5 drugs was generated (visualized in Figure 6).
Including the five largest tf-idf fractions, generated a vector of 70
ATC level 5 drugs.
When inspecting Figure 6 it can be observed that most of the
drugs that caused the AEs of the different clusters are placed in
the ATC chapter N, Nervous system (72%). On one hand this
reflects that these drugs were the most prevalent at this particular mental health center and on the other it could be inferred
that these drugs typically have several AEs. The clustering based
on tf-idf fraction vectors in ATC level 5 drug space in Figure 6,
shows that some clusters have a similar profile of drugs that cause
the AEs of the patients in the cluster. For example, there is a
group of clusters (group A: 19, 23, 7, 45, and 43) whose AEs were
mainly correlated with clozapine (N05AH02), while the AEs of
another group of clusters (group B: 44, 42, 3, 13, 41, 21, 28, 17, 38,
and 11) were mainly caused by methadone (N07BC02). The most

FIGURE 3 | Network of 976 patients and 25,804 patient pair associations
based on the patient adverse event profile. Each node represents a patient
and the links between the patients are associations with a cosine dissimilarity

distinguishing AEs of these groups of clusters (group A: “saliva
discharge,” “appetite increase,” “constipation,” “seizure,” and “bad
mood,” and group B: “unrest leg,” “schizophrenia,” “anxiety,”
“unrest,” “psychiatric problem,” “drug interaction,” “confusion,”
“irritation,” “respiration problem,” and “anger”) may therefore be
related as they are caused to a large extent by the same drugs.
Some clusters have two or three drugs that are the main culprits for the AEs of the patients in these clusters. For example,
for cluster 37, with “auditory hallucination” as the most distinguishing AE, oxazepam (N05BA04) comprises 34% of the vector
sum, while zopiclone (N05CF01) comprises 21%, and for cluster
35, with “dry mouth” as the most distinguishing AE, olanzapine
(N05AH03) comprises 22% of the vector sum, while sumatriptan
(N02CC01) comprises 27%. Hence, the AEs of the patients with
prescription of these drugs may be a result of the combination of
the drugs. However, in order to conclude this, additional in depth
analyses should be performed. In general, the value for the most

distinguishing drug for each cluster was only 2.2 times larger than
the value of the second most distinguishing one (compared to 8.2
with the AEs of the clusters). This further accentuates that several
different drugs are the causes for the AEs of the patients in the
different clusters.
Cluster specific diagnoses

Taking the most distinguishing diagnose of patients in each cluster (i.e., the diagnosis with the largest tf-idf fraction) yielded a
vector of 30 ICD10 level 3 coded diagnoses. This means that
for some of the clusters, the most distinguishing diagnosis is the
same. When including the second largest tf-idf fractions, a vector
of 44 ICD10 level 3 coded diagnoses was produced, which is visualized in a heat map in Figure 7. Including the five largest tf-idf
fractions yielded a vector of 74 ICD10 level 3 coded diagnoses.
In general, the most distinguishing diagnose for a cluster did
not stand out compared to the most distinguishing AE for each

FIGURE 4 | Heat map of the adverse event (AE) composition of 45
clusters, based on clustering of the AE profiles of the patients. The
values, indicated by color, display the fraction that each AE represents out of

cluster, as the fraction it composed out of the vector sum was only
1.7 times larger than the second most distinguishing diagnose.
In all, 9 clusters had a most distinguishing diagnose that compose more than 10% of the vector sum, while 10 clusters had no
diagnose that compose more than 5% of the tf-idf fraction sum.
Additionally, 14 clusters had two diagnoses that both comprised a
fraction of 5–10%.
The clustering based on tf-idf fraction vectors in ICD10 level
3 coded diagnosis space in Figure 7, shows that most clusters
ended up in one large cluster while a few clusters in the left
of the heat map were markedly different. This indicates that
the patients tended to have many of the same diagnoses across
clusters.
When extracting the diagnoses of the patients from the
clinical narratives, the diagnoses that are possible AEs were
not filtered out. Hence, as a result of the method used, it
could be that the AEs that affected the patients were similar

to the diagnoses that the patients in the clusters had. This
was only the case for three clusters, namely cluster 45, where
the patients had an epilepsy diagnose and experienced seizures
as an AE, cluster 38, where patients had a pneumonia diagnose and respiration problems as an AE, and cluster 41
with patients that had pervasive developmental disorders and
had psychiatric problems as an AE. Thus, the diagnoses and
the AEs of the patients of the clusters were in general not
similar.
An unexpected correlation between diagnoses and AEs of the
patients in the clusters might indicate a causative factor, meaning
that patients with a certain diagnose are more likely to experience
a certain AE. For example cluster 35 had patients diagnosed with
migraine that experienced “dry mouth” as an AE, cluster 43 had
patients with dental caries that experienced “bad mood” as an AE,
and cluster 32 had patients with a psoriasis diagnosis who had
“tremor” as an AE.

Co-occurrence score network

The co-occurrence of AEs analysis yielded an AE-AE network comprising 173 AEs and 262 significant co-occurrence
score value associations (see Figure 8). The figure contains one large interconnected network and a number of
smaller clusters separated from the large network. The

of each cluster. The AEs are ordered according to their prevalence in the

AEs are colored according to the anatomical area they
relate to.
It can be observed that AEs related to the same anatomical
area tend to gather in the same regions of the network e.g., the
nervous disorders (cyan) are spatially close to each other and
the same applies to the musculo-skeletal disorders (orange) and
skin disorders (purple). This indicates for example that patients

with skin AEs tend to have other skin AEs, e.g., “itch” and “rash.”
Such a connection is likely partly the result of the relatedness of
the disease features and partly of the non-independence of the
way that the medical care providers express themselves in the
clinical narratives. Unexpected correlations can also be observed,
e.g., the correlations in the large network between “auditory hallucination” and “vomiting,” and in the small separate networks
between “kidney problem” and “asthma,” and “knee damage” and
“increase liver function tests.”
To a certain extent, the co-occurrence analysis also stratifies
the patients. Patients with AEs that are strongly associated have
similar AE profiles and could be considered as a group. The characteristics of such groups of patients can be further examined in
terms of the drugs they have received (polypharmacy may be the
underlying cause), the diagnoses they have, their age and sex, their
genetic variants, their proteome expression etc., in order to determine the underlying cause for why they are affected by both AEs.
This might identify risk factors for the generation of the AEs in
question.
Weighted edges network

Another AE co-occurrence network was created as shown in
Figure 9 when exploring the co-occurrences of AEs in patients by
assigning weighted edges and extracting the multiscale backbone
at a significance level of 0.01. Ten common AEs were removed (the

ten most prevalent AEs at the mental health center), which yielded
a network of 240 AEs and 327 associations. Hence there is a ratio
of 1.36 associations to each AE, which is not far from the ratio
of the co-occurrence score network (1.51). The two networks
share 108 AEs (62% of the nodes from the co-occurrence score
network) and 189 associations (72% of the associations in the cooccurrence score network). Considering that there are 1190 AEs
and 707455 possible AE associations, these percentages are high.
Thus, in spite of some differences in the networks, the methods
do yield very similar results.
Comparable to the network of Figure 8, the network in
Figure 9 contains one large interconnected network and a number of smaller clusters (18 clusters) separated from the large
network. Again, AEs related to the same anatomical area tend
to gather in the same regions of the network. The AEs that one
would expect to correlate do indeed co-occur in the same patients
such as the association between “itch” and “rash.” Some of the
associations seen in the network of Figure 8 reappear in the network of Figure 9, for example the association between “memory
problem” and “arm problem” and between “saliva discharge” and
“leucocytosis.” Furthermore, a number of other potentially interesting AE co-occurrences can be observed such as the associations
between “trigeminal nerve neuralgia” and “gastrointestinal tract
problem,” between “cramp” and “genital warts,” and between
“rhinoconjunctivitis” and “damage liver.”

DISCUSSION
We have demonstrated a practical non-hypothesis driven
approach to assess AE occurrences in patients. The presented
methods exploit phenotypic AE data contained in EMRs,
extracted as previously described (Eriksson et al., 2013, 2014),
by clustering and visualizing data to enhance understanding of
the AEs. The AE data is used to divide a cohort into patient
groups, which allows us to investigate patterns in AE occurrence.
While the results from the AE co-occurrence analysis show for the
most part known and unsurprising correlations, unexpected correlations are also observed. Hence, an advantage of this method
is that it allows the discovery of findings irrespectively of previous knowledge. It works from the entire space of AEs for all
drugs in a concerted manner. Such findings may provide clues
to further research that will help to enlighten the etiology of
ADR genesis and understand in particular, which patients are
affected. Especially associations between well-studied ADRs and
less studied ADRs may provide insight to the less studied ADRs.
While extracting AEs from clinical narratives shows great
promise, the results of the visualization presented here depend
largely on the data quality. One has to keep in mind that the

information contained in EMRs was not generated primarily
for research purposes. This entails that symptoms that have not
been clinically confirmed are in some cases also considered an
AE if they are related to drug use. This may capture false positive AEs signals but also ensures that all signals are captured.
Moreover, with regard to the data, the results are domain-specific
as they depend on the prevalence of ADRs in the patient population being analyzed. Hence, the results showed here represent
the AEs in a psychiatric cohort and employing these methods
on other data sets will yield different results. Furthermore, every
distance measure and statistical filtering mechanism has a bias
and the methods that we have chosen is no exception. This is
why two methods were employed to provide critical comparison, and though the networks are different the two methods still
provide comparable results and are equally employable. They further complement each other by identifying different unexpected
co-occurrences of AEs.
The data set used here is small for pharmacovigilance studies,
and does not provide sufficient statistical evidence to conclude the
existence of true correlations. However, the results still provide
observations for further study and validate the methods for use

and patient profiles can guide treatment procedures. Here we provide a starting point for further in depth analyses that increase the
knowledge of AE-drug causality by revealing predisposing factors
such as disease state, polypharmacy, or other co-occurring AEs.
Ultimately, such knowledge may help prevent ADRs.
