Abstract
A recent literature review linked norepinephrinergic stimulation to
alterations in cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-mediated signaling
in cardiac myocytes and suggested that this might contribute to the
pathological mechanisms that lead to chamber enlargement and
hypocontractility, which are seen in dilated cardiomyopathy. This
accompanies a large body of literature linking cardiac sympathetic outflow
activation in early heart failure with progressive myocyte deterioration. As
the mode of action of a number of antidepressants involves the inhibition
of neuronal norepinephrine reuptake to varying degrees, this study was
conducted to assess whether such agents might be associated with
disproportionate reporting of cardiomyopathy. Limited data exist
specifically examining the association between the antidepressant use and
the cardiomyopathy. Using a data mining algorithm (DMA), we
quantitatively investigated the association between antidepressant agents
that predominantly exert their effects through inhibiting neuronal
norepinephrine reuptake (rather than serotonin) and cardiomyopathy. We
retrospectively applied a Bayesian DMA, the Bayesian Confidence
Propagation Neural Network, to the cumulative reports in the Food and

Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (through the fourth
quarter of 2006) and World Health Organization Vigibase (through the
second quarter of 2007) databases. A threshold of the posterior interval
95% lower limit > 0 was used to define a signal of disproportionate
reporting with individual or groups of antidepressants and
cardiomyopathy-related terms. The analysis suggested that there is no
direct relationship between antidepressants with greater norepinephrine
reuptake inhibitor activity (affinity for norepinephrine reuptake
transporter or selectivity for norepinephrine versus serotonin) and
reporting of cardiomyopathy. In contrast, an inverse correlation might
exist with a higher number of cases identified with tricyclic
antidepressants showing lower norepinephrine reuptake inhibition and the
serotonin/norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors as well as with serotonin/
norepinephrine/slight dopamine reuptake inhibitor.

Antidepressants and cardiomyopathy

protects the heart from adverse effects of increased catecholamine stimulation (Movsesian and Bristow, 2005).
To assess whether cardiomyopathy secondary to increased
norepinephrine levels/increased sympathetic drive (as a result
of inhibition of neuronal norepinephrine reuptake) might be a
potential risk for novel norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors
(NRIs) under development, we have used a pharmacovigilance-based quantitative approach for reviewing safety
data for marketed agents with similar modes of action.
Limited data exist specifically for examining the association
between the antidepressant use and the cardiomyopathy. The
majority of studies addressing cardiovascular safety of antidepressants describe a possible association between the ischaemic
heart disease (IHD) and the chronic use of tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) (Cohen, et al., 2000; Hippisley-Cox, et al., 2001;
Martí, et al., 1995; Pacher, et al., 1998; Pratt, et al., 1996; Roose,
et al., 1998), particularly, dothiepine (dosulepin) (Hippisley-Cox,
et al., 2001). It should be noted that the depression itself has
been identified as an independent risk factor for mortality
(Frasure-Smith, et al., 1995) and morbidity (Ladwig, et al.,
1994) following myocardial infarction, and also a risk factor
for IHD (Hippisley-Cox, et al., 1998); however, there is limited
information about an association with cardiomyopathy.
TCAs are well recognized as a cause of cardiotoxicity, and
therefore, they are not recommended for patients with IHD.
They promote both arrhythmogenicity and orthostatic hypotension that can precipitate a myocardial infarction (Frasure-Smith,
et al., 1995). However, there is little evidence that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), which are another class of
antidepressants, have serious cardiac adverse effects (Glassman
and Roose, 1994, 1998). SSRIs have significant advantages over
TCAs; they produce fewer cardiotoxic, anticholinergic, and antihistaminergic adverse effects (Sheline, et al., 1997).
Additionally, a few case reports have described cases of
dilated cardiomyopathy with TCA use (Cohen, et al., 2000;
Hippisley-Cox, et al., 2001); however, no reports showing an
association between the cardiomyopathy and the chronic use
of selective NRIs, SSRIs or mixed serotonin/NRIs (SNRIs)
have been found. A single case report of reversible cardiomyopathy was identified with the serotonin/norepinephrine/slight
dopamine reuptake inhibitor (SN[D]RI) sibutramine, which is
used for treating obesity (Martí, et al., 1995).
Given that pharmacovigilance systems are necessary to
detect rare manifestations of drug toxicity that may not be
detected in observational studies and clinical trials, and given
the aforementioned case reports, discernible gradients in the
spontaneous reporting of various adverse events related to antidepressant drugs, including cardiomyopathy, might provide an
additional information source that could suggest possible associations in the appropriate clinical contexts. Contemporary
pharmacovigilance often relies on a combination of clinical
assessment of case reports and quantitative analysis of aggregate data to achieve this objective.
Data mining algorithms (DMAs) are currently being
applied to post-marketing spontaneous reporting system
(SRS) databases as a part of a multidisciplinary approach to

drug safety, providing quantitative data as a supplement to
case-level clinical review. Contemporary DMAs based on
2 × 2 contingency tables can search SRS databases for statistical dependencies between the drugs and the events in excess of
what would be expected if the drug and event were independently distributed in the database, highlighting statistically
distinctive or disproportionately reported drug–event combinations (DECs) (Hauben, et al., 2005). The statistical metrics are
related to the background probability of drug (across all
events) and event (across all or most drugs) to derive the internal control or model of expected reporting frequency in the
absence of external data on the level of drug exposure, a
“pseudo-observed to expected ratio.” If a sufficient correlation
exists between these observed statistical dependencies and
potential drug–event relationships, DMAs could improve
the ability to detect signals of novel adverse events in the
post-approval period of marketed drugs. However, while
these are promising additions to the pharmacovigilance toolkit,
it is important to recall that the practical implementation and
application of these tools involve numerous subjective decisions
of varying degrees of arbitrariness (Hauben, et al., 2005; 2007).
As the mechanism of action of a number of antidepressants
involves the inhibition of neuronal norepinephrine reuptake
(and consequently, varying degrees of norepinephrinergic
stimulation), a pharmacovigilance-based approach using postmarketing drug safety databases was undertaken to quantitatively assess whether: (1) antidepressant agents were associated
with increased reports of dilated cardiomyopathy and (2) cardiomyopathy or related events were more frequently reported
with antidepressants, or related compounds that predominantly
exert their effects through inhibiting neuronal norepinephrine
reuptake rather than serotonin. Because the primary focus
was on agents with NRI rather than serotonin reuptake inhibition, SSRIs were not included in the data mining analysis.

Methods
Data sources
We used two public SRS databases (1) the U.S. Food and
Drug Administration (FDA) Adverse Event Reporting System
(AERS) database and (2) the World Health Organization
(WHO) database (also known as Vigibase). These databases
are massive repositories of spontaneous reports. FDA AERS
contains safety surveillance adverse event reports related to
approved drugs and therapeutic biological products, collected
since 1968 and submitted in accordance with mandatory
reporting obligations by pharmaceutical companies and voluntary reporting by healthcare professionals and consumers.
It functions as an early warning system for adverse drug events
(ADEs) not detected during pre-approval testing. The WHO
International Drug Monitoring Centre, located in Uppsala
Sweden, collects information on spontaneously reported
cases of suspected ADEs forwarded from national centers
(appointed by national governments) in over 70 countries

Antidepressants and cardiomyopathy

(Bate, et al., 1998). The WHO Vigibase contains more than
three million case records and provides a unique source of
international ADEs and likewise serves as an important drug
safety sentinel system.

Selected individual drugs and drug groups
FDA AERS database and WHO Vigibase database For this
analysis, antidepressant drugs and drugs with similar modes
of action were classified into four groups based on mechanism
of action including relative selectivity for the NRI (Table 1):
1) NRIs included the antidepressant reboxetine and atomoxetine (the latter is used for the treatment of attention-deficit
hyperactivity disorder);
2) non-antidepressant mixed catecholamine (serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine) reuptake inhibitors (SN[D]RIs),
which included sibutramine used for the treatment of obesity;
3) balanced SNRIs included duloxetine, venlafaxine, and milnacipran; and
4) TCAs and the isoquinoline antidepressant nomifensine
included in descending order of NRI selectivity: nomifensine,
maprotiline, desipramine, imipramine, nortriptyline, amitriptyline, and clomipramine. Although nomifensine is an isoquinoline antidepressant rather than TCA, it is often grouped
with TCAs in texts based on its pharmacological actions,
even though it is a more potent dopamine reuptake inhibitor
than any other TCA. For this reason, we had grouped it with
the TCA group rather than the SNDRI group.
The objective of classifying the drugs into the above four categories was to rank the agents based on the affinity for the norTable 1

505

epinephrine reuptake transporter (NET), thereby representing
their ability to elevate norepinephrine through inhibition of neuronal norepinephrine reuptake. The classification and ranking
took into account the relative selectivity for the NET versus
the serotonin reuptake transporter (SRT), thereby ranking the
relative contribution of increasing norepinephrine versus serotonin. Classifying the agents in this way was done to help assess
whether reports of cardiomyopathy might be associated with the
potential gradient of potency at the NET or selectivity for NRI.
The agent with the greatest affinity for the NET was atomoxetine (Table 1), with the antidepressant reboxetine showing
slightly lower affinity but with greater selectivity for norepinephrine reuptake versus serotonin reuptake than atomoxetine.
Specific binding data could not be identified for all the TCAs,
and the relative ranking of those agents for norepinephrine
reuptake versus serotonin reuptake was done based on the
accepted gradation from pharmacology text books (Rang and
Dale, 1991).
For this disproportionality analyses, we used both individual
drugs (e.g., atomoxetine and reboxetine) and drug groups (e.g.,
NRIs and SNRIs). The latter were obtained by combining individual drugs into drug groups through the “UDT” feature provided by the software vendor (DrugLogic, Reston, VA).

(NTIS). These quarterly updates are subjected to extensive
cleaning (i.e., the removal of redundant drug nomenclature
and duplicate reports) by the software vendor prior to release
to the subscribers. In this analysis, events specific for cardiomyopathy and, more generally, for heart failure were selected. The
selected MedDRA preferred terms (PTs) from the FDA AERS
database are presented in Table 2. In addition to these individual PTs, we combined all individual PTs into a single
cardiomyopathy-related user-defined term (UDT).
WHO Vigibase database The WHO Vigibase utilizes the
WHO dictionary to code and enter the data. The WHO dictionary is less granular than MedDRA, as there are fewer PTs in
the WHO dictionary, and therefore, some are less specific when
compared to MedDRA. Therefore, relevant information on a
particular adverse event in Vigibase is less likely to be fragmented between individual PTs, but there may be a higher likelihood of identical database coding of relatively distinct events
with lesser conceptual overlap. The PTs from the WHO Vigibase included cardiomyopathy, cardiac failure, cardiac failure
left, and cardiac failure right. We also combined all individual
PTs into a single ‘cardiomyopathy-related UDT.’

or expected frequency. When a high number of cases are
observed relative to the expected, such DECs may be considered
to be disproportionately reported and possibly flagged for further investigation depending on the clinical context, thus the
term “disproportionality analysis”. Data mining outputs suggestive of disproportionate reporting of a DEC in an SRS database
without clinical, pharmacological, and/or (pharmaco) epidemiological context is called a “signal of disproportionate reporting
(SDR)” (Hauben, et al., 2005). This does not by itself constitute
a “signal of suspected causality” warranting formal investigation
(Hauben and Aronson, 2009).
We used a Bayesian DMA termed the Bayesian Confidence
Propagation Neural Network (BCPNN). With the BCPNN
methodology, the dependencies between a drug and an adverse
event (AD) are gauged using a logarithmic measure of disproportionality called the Information Component (IC). The IC value is
calculated within a Bayesian framework that dampens
(“shrinks”) statistical disproportionalities involving associations
with limited information (i.e. small numbers of observed and/or
expected numbers of reports). Specifically, the IC value is based
on the number of case reports with a particular drug, a particular
ADE, and a specific DEC, and the total number of reports in the
database. The aforementioned quantities are modeled as random
variables with prior probability (Dirichlet) distributions updated
via Bayes theorem to provide a posterior distribution and associated posterior intervals (Bate, et al., 1998). A positive IC value
indicates that a particular DEC appears in the database more
often than expected relative to the entire database. An IC value
of zero may be interpreted as a lack of quantitative dependency.
A negative IC value indicates that the combination is occurring
less frequently than statistically expected in the database. The
higher the IC value, the more the DEC stands out (↑ SDR)
from the background (Noren, et al., 2006). In real-world pharmacovigilance, a commonly used threshold for an SDR with
this metric is the lower two and half percentile of the posterior
distribution of the IC (ICLL: 0.025) exceeding zero.
In this analysis, we retrospectively applied the BCPNN to
the cumulative reports in FDA AERS (through the fourth
quarter of 2006) (Q Scan FDA version 3.2, DrugLogic, Reston,
VA) database and WHO Vigibase (through the second quarter
of 2007) (Q Scan World version 3.2, DrugLogic, Reston, VA).
The analyses were performed using four different DEC categories: (1) individual drug – cardiomyopathy-related individual
PTs; (2) drug group – cardiomyopathy-related individual PTs;
(3) individual drug – cardiomyopathy-related UDT; and (4)
drug group – cardiomyopathy-related UDT. The analyses were
stratified by age, gender, and year of report, with duplicate cases
removed. Stratification may reduce spurious associations due to
confounding and decrease the number of disproportionalities.
However, for various reasons, extensive stratification could
also result in missing stratum specific associations of interest
(Evans, 2008; Hopstadius, et al., 2008; Woo, et al., 2008).
An IC value with 95% PIs (posterior intervals) (upper and
lower limits) was computed for each DEC.

Antidepressants and cardiomyopathy

imipramine – congestive cardiomyopathy; imipramine –
cardiomyopathy; and imipramine – right ventricular failure.
In the WHO database, the following DECs showed SDRs:
sibutramine – cardiomyopathy; amitriptyline – cardiomyopathy; clomipramine – cardiomyopathy; imipramine – cardiac
failure right; and imipramine – cardiomyopathy.

Results
Figures 1A and 1B (individual antidepressant drugs) and 2
(drug groups) display the number of relevant reports, and IC
(95% PIs) for cardiomyopathy-related individual PTs in FDA
AERS, whereas Figures 3 and 4 present similar information for
the WHO Vigibase. Because we studied a large number of
DECs in both the databases, only DECs with IC > 0 were
included in the figures.
The results are summarized under four headings as follows.

base (amitriptyline – cardiomyopathy-related UDT and imipramine – cardiomyopathy-related UDT).

Drug groups and cardiomyopathy-related UDT (data not
shown)
None of the drug groups – cardiomyopathy-related UDTs in
the FDA database generated an SDR, whereas one grouping
(TCAs – cardiomyopathy-related UDT) in the WHO database
generated an SDR.

Discussion
This quantitative disproportionality analysis provides an additional perspective to published case reports describing the
association between the antidepressants that inhibit neuronal
norepinephrine reuptake and ADEs related to cardiomyopathy.
The results suggest that if any association exists between cardiomyopathy and the antidepressants that elevate norepinephrine it
is an inverse correlation. Signals of disproportionate reporting
were identified for the TCAs with lower NRI activity/NET
selectivity (amitriptyline, imipramine, and clomipramine) and
with mixed/balanced catecholamine reuptake activity, i.e., the

SNRI venlafaxine and SN[D]RI sibutramine. However, considering the significant limitations of both the SRS data and DMAs
(Hauben, et al., 2005), causality between the investigated drugs
and adverse event cannot be established. The lack of disproportionality findings with the NRIs might suggest that selective
NRI agents (reboxetine and atomoxetine) are not associated
with cardiomyopathy.
Disproportionality analysis may be a useful strategy for risk
management in the life cycle of a product. Although disproportionality analysis should be robust to ‘non-differential’ reporting
variations, inherent limitations associated with the passive surveillance of ADEs, such as under-reporting of non-serious
adverse events, duplicate reporting, and higher reporting of
adverse events in the first few years of marketing, preclude making causal inferences about the associations between the drugs
and the events, along with differential conclusions between the
drugs based on this analysis. Further, the findings from this nonsystematic analysis cannot be used to draw inferences about the
global performance characteristics of these techniques, which
currently involve subjective choices in their execution and interpretation. Such quantitative analysis is a supplement and not a
substitute for signal detection and evaluation based on case-level
clinical review, which remains pivotal.

(through the second quarter of 2007).

Determining the systematic performance characteristics of
DMAs requires testing multiple thresholds using each algorithm in diverse pharmacovigilance scenarios. We also did not
report on specificity, which would have allowed us to draw
some conclusions as to whether our analysis achieved discriminant SDR generation with the drugs examined. Additionally,
our analysis was cross-sectional in nature. It is possible that a
time series approach, in which the database is rolled back and
increasing “snapshots” of the database are examined as it
grows over time, may have identified transient SDRs at earlier
time points.
The current analysis focuses on the norepinephrine and serotonin reuptake inhibition mode of action of antidepressants. The
agents, TCAs in particular, also have other off-target pharmacological activity and the classification adopted in this review does
not take into account that pharmacology as the objective of this
analysis was to assess whether antidepressants working through
norepinephrine reuptake inhibition were associated with reporting of cardiomyopathy and whether there was any gradient to
the strength of the reporting association with more selective NRI

agents. Further analyses assessing the serotonin selective reuptake inhibitors would be useful to assess the serotonin selective
end of the spectrum and whether the inverse correlation noted
here is real. Epidemiological studies might also be useful to further evaluate any potential association between the antidepressants and the cardiomyopathy identified in this data mining
analysis and the case reports in the literature.
