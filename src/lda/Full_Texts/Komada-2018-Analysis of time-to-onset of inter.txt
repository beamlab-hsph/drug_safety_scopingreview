The aim of this study was to investigate the time-to-onset of drug-induced interstitial lung disease (DILD) following the administration of small molecule molecularly-targeted drugs via the use of the spontaneous adverse reaction
reporting system of the Japanese Adverse Drug Event Report database. DILD datasets for afatinib, alectinib, bortezomib, crizotinib, dasatinib, erlotinib, everolimus, geˆtinib, imatinib, lapatinib, nilotinib, osimertinib, sorafenib,
sunitinib, temsirolimus, and tofacitinib were used to calculate the median onset times of DILD and the Weibull distribution parameters, and to perform the hierarchical cluster analysis. The median onset times of DILD for afatinib, bortezomib, crizotinib, erlotinib, geˆtinib, and nilotinib were within one month. The median onset times of DILD for
dasatinib, everolimus, lapatinib, osimertinib, and temsirolimus ranged from 1 to 2 months. The median onset times of
the DILD for alectinib, imatinib, and tofacitinib ranged from 2 to 3 months. The median onset times of the DILD for
sunitinib and sorafenib ranged from 8 to 9 months. Weibull distributions for these drugs when using the cluster analysis
showed that there were 4 clusters. Cluster 1 described a subgroup with early to later onset DILD and early failure type
proˆles or a random failure type proˆle. Cluster 2 exhibited early failure type proˆles or a random failure type proˆle
with early onset DILD. Cluster 3 exhibited a random failure type proˆle or wear out failure type proˆles with later onset
DILD. Cluster 4 exhibited an early failure type proˆle or a random failure type proˆle with the latest onset DILD.

INTRODUCTION
Drug-induced interstitial lung disease (DILD) can
be caused by a variety of drugs including chemotherapeutic agents, antibiotics, antiarrhythmic drugs, and
immunosuppressive agents. Up to 10％ of patients
receiving chemotherapeutic agents have been reported
to develop adverse drug reactions (ADRs) in their
lungs.1) The mechanisms of DILD that have been suggested include 1) induction of pulmonary ˆbrosis due
to a direct toxic reaction to the drugs, 2) the drugs act
as potential antigens or haptens that subsequently
cause immune-mediated lung toxicity, and 3) the
drugs cause phospholipidosis in alveolar macrophages and in type 2 cells.2)
One of the keys to the recent advances in cancer
therapy has been the use molecularly-targeted agents.
Previous studies have investigated factors related to
the occurrence of DILD after the administration of
molecularly-targeted drugs. These studies have examined epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI), vascular endothelial
e-mail: komada＠himeji-du.ac.jp

growth factor receptor (VEGFR) TKI, platelet derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) TKI, and
the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)
inhibitor.36) DILD is a commonly observed ADR
that occurs after the administration of molecularlytargeted drugs. In Japan, a retrospective analysis
found geˆtinib-induced ILD occurred in 3.5％ of the
patients, while a prospective study reported that it occurred in 5.8％ of the patients.7,8) DILD incidence
with erlotinib therapy in Japan has been reported to
be 26.4％.6,9)
Variations in the time-to-onset for ADRs have been
shown to range from several minutes to months or
even years after the beginning of treatment. In our
previous study, we analyzed the adverse events information using the Japanese Adverse Drug Event
Report (JADER) and found that the median time-toonset of DILD for geˆtinib and for erlotinib were 25
and 22 d, respectively, while the time-to-onset for imatinib was 133 d.10) During the ˆrst 4 weeks after
treatment initiation, there was a clear increased risk
of DILD associated with geˆtinib treatment.
However, the risk of DILD associated with geˆtinib
treatment appears to occur at greater than 4 weeks af 2018 The Pharmaceutical Society of Japan

ter the initiation of the treatment. In addition, the
clinical features of early onset cases are characterized
by a rapid progression and a high mortality rate.11)
Among those who developed acute DILD, the mortality rate in the treated patients was 31.6％.12) Thus, it
is important to determine how the DILD occurrence
varies over time during the administration of small
molecule molecularly-targeted drug therapy.
The Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency
(PMDA) has created and released a spontaneous
ADR reporting system for the JADER database. This
database, which consists of 4 data tables, includes the
patient demographics information table (demo), the
drug information table (drug), the adverse events table (reac), and the primary illness table (hist). The
adverse events in reac are coded according to the terminology preferred by the Medical Dictionary for
Regulatory Activities (MedDRA).13) The lowest level
term group for DILD includes many diŠerent syndromes (e.g., interstitial lung ˆbrosis, interstitial
pneumonia, pneumonia interstitial diŠuse, follicular
bronchiolitis, etc.).
Many reports have recently highlighted the fact
that the post-marketing spontaneous reporting database has proven to be a valuable resource for estimating the time-to-onset of ADRs when using a Weibull
analysis.1419) The scale parameter of the Weibull distribution is used to determine the scale of the distribution function, with the scale parameter deˆned as 63.2
％ of the lower-side of the Weibull distribution. Thus,
when a larger value for the scale parameter is present,
this stretches the distribution, while a smaller value
for the scale parameter will shrink the data distribution. The shape parameter of the Weibull distribution
can be used to deˆne a hazard without having to refer
to a reference population. For example, if the shape
parameter is less than 1 and the 95％ conˆdence interval (95％ CI) of the shape parameter is less than the
value 1, the hazard is considered to have decreased
over time (early failure type proˆle). If the shape
parameter is equal to or nearly 1 and the 95％ CI of
the shape parameter includes the value 1, the hazard
is estimated to have been constant over time (random
failure type proˆle). If the shape parameter is greater
than 1 and the 95％ CI of the shape parameter excluded the value 1, the hazard is considered to have increased over time (wear out failure type proˆle).
Over time, the utilization of the principle of cluster
analysis has expanded so that it is now used in multi-

Vol. 138, No. 2 (2018)

ple areas, such as bioinformatics, epidemiology and
diagnostics.2023) Cluster analysis techniques have also
been used to identify patterns. When grouping individuals into clusters, similarity between members of
the same clusters is strong. In current study, I applied
the cluster analysis in order to classify the time-to-onset of DILD after the administration of small molecule molecularly-targeted drugs. The aim of this study
was to investigate the time-to-onset of DILD after the
administration of small molecule molecularly-targeted drugs using JADER, and then determine and classify the diŠerences in the time-to-onset of DILD for
these drugs.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The JADER database from April 2004 to March
2017 was downloaded from the PMDA website.24)
The JADER database consists of four data tables:
patient demographic information (demo), drug information (drug), adverse event and outcome informations (reac), and medical history information
(hist). The demo (440485 cases), drug (2833811
cases) and reac (697424 cases) tables were integrated
into the dataset for the time-to-onset using JMP 12.0
(SAS Institute Inc., Cary). It is known that duplicate
report that exists in these tables has an impact on the
evaluation and analysis. Therefore, in order to exclude the overlap of reported cases, the duplicate
reports were removed based on each identiˆcation
number. In addition, the blank and date that was not
correctly described were excluded. Time-to-onset of
DILD was calculated from the time of the patient's
prescription to the ˆrst occurrence of DILD. The
datasets for the time-to-onset of DILD for afatinib,
alectinib, bortezomib, crizotinib, dasatinib, erlotinib,
everolimus, geˆtinib, imatinib, lapatinib, nilotinib,
osimertinib, sorafenib, sunitinib, temsirolimus, and
tofacitinib were then used to calculate the Weibull
parameters. I postulated that cluster analysis could be
applied for classifying the time-to-onset patterns of
DILD following the administration of small molecule
molecularly-targeted drugs. The object of this algorithm to classify the time-to-onset patterns of
DILD that exhibit relevant diŠerences in the median
onset time, the scale parameter and the shape
parameter of Weibull distribution, and to compute a
dendrogram that assembles these into a single tree.
Cluster analysis was carried out using the median onset time, the scale parameter and the shape

Ward's method was utilized to generate a dendrogram for estimation of the number of likely clusters.
The estimations for Weibull parameters and cluster
analysis were performed using JMP 12.0. Statistical
analysis was performed using the Steel-Dwass test on
each pair. p values of less than 0.05 were considered
to indicate statistical signiˆcance.
RESULTS
The median onset times of DILD for afatinib, bortezomib, crizotinib, erlotinib, geˆtinib, and nilotinib
were within one month (Table 1). The median onset
times of DILD for dasatinib, everolimus, lapatinib,
osimertinib, and temsirolimus ranged from 1 to 2
month. The median onset times of the DILD for alectinib, imatinib, and tofacitinib ranged from 2 to 3
months. The median onset times of the DILD for
sunitinib and sorafenib ranged from 8 to 9 months.
The earliest median time-to-onset of DILD was 8 d
for bortezomib. In contrast, the median time-to-onset
for sorafenib was 262 d, which was 32.8 times longer
than that for bortezomib. Comparisons of the median
time-to-onset of DILD between sorafenib and all of
the other drugs showed that sunitinib (247 d) and
tofacitinib (65 d) were not signiˆcantly diŠerent. For
sunitinib, the median time-to-onset of DILD was signiˆcantly longer than that of all drugs except for
tofacitinib. The median time-to-onset of DILD for

Signiˆcant diŠerence ( p＜0.05)

imatinib (93 d) was signiˆcantly longer than the medians for afatinib (26.5 d), bortezomib, crizotinib
(22 d), erlotinib (21 d), everolimus (54 d), geˆtinib
(24 d), osimertinib (34.5 d), and temsirolimus (35
d). The median time-to-onset of DILD for alectinib
(67 d) and everolimus were signiˆcantly longer than
the medians for afatinib, bortezomib, crizotinib, erlotinib, geˆtinib, osimertinib, and temsirolimus. The
median time-to-onset of DILD for lapatinib (53 d)
was signiˆcantly longer than the medians for bortezomib, crizotinib, and erlotinib. The median timeto-onset of DILD for temsirolimus was signiˆcantly
longer than the medians for bortezomib and erlotinib.
In addition, the median time-to-onset of DILD for
bortezomib was signiˆcantly shorter than the medians
for afatinib, crizotinib, dasatinib (31.5 d), erlotinib,
geˆtinib, and osimertinib.
The histograms of the DILD onset time for bortezomib, crizotinib, erlotinib, afatinib, geˆtinib,
dasatinib, nilotinib, lapatinib, imatinib, and
sorafenib demonstrate the early onset time proˆles,
with the DILD then shown to decrease over time (F,
D, O, E, I, K, J, N, P, and L in Fig. 1). Since the upper 95％ CI for the shape parameter was less than 1,
the DILD onset time proˆles of these drugs were considered to be similar to the early failure type (Table
2). The DILD onset time proˆles for temsirolimus,
alectinib, tofacitinib, and sunitinib were classiˆed as
the random failure type based on the 95％ CI of the

for osimertinib and everolimus indicated there was a
broad distribution (A and G in Fig. 1). The shape
parameters for osimertinib and everolimus were
categorized as the wear out failure type proˆle, as the
95％ CI exceeded 1.
Figure 2 shows the hierarchical cluster analysis that
generated the dendrogram for estimation of the 4

nilotinib, dasatinib, lapatinib, tofacitinib, and imatinib, showed early failure type proˆles (bortezomib, nilotinib, dasatinib, lapatinib, and imatinib) or a random failure type proˆle (tofacitinib)
with an early to later onset time. Cluster 2, which included erlotinib, geˆtinib, crizotinib, afatinib, and
temsirolimus, exhibited early failure type proˆles (erlotinib, geˆtinib, crizotinib, and afatinib) or a random failure type proˆle (temsirolimus) with an early
onset time. Cluster 3, which included osimertinib,
everolimus, and alectinib, exhibited a random failure
type proˆle (alectinib) or wear out failure type proˆles (everolimus and osimertinib) with a later onset
time. Cluster 4, which included sorafenib and

DISCUSSION
Currently there have been over 450 diŠerent drugs
implicated as being involved in DILD.2) Recently,
there has been an increased amount of data on
molecularly-targeted drugs that cause DILD, including EGFR TKI, anti-EGFR antibodies, mTOR inhibitors, Bcr-Abl TKI, and multi-kinase inhibitors.25)
In the current study, the median onset times of
DILD for the 26S proteasome inhibitor
(bortezomib), anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)
TKI ( crizotinib ) , EGFR TKI ( erlotinib and
geˆtinib), ErbB family inhibitor (afatinib), and BcrAbl TKI (nilotinib) were within one month. The median onset times of DILD for Bcr-Abl TKI
(dasatinib), mTOR inhibitor (everolimus and temsirolimus), ErbB family inhibitor (lapatinib), and
EGFR TKI (osimertinib) ranged from 1 to 2 month.
The median onset times of the DILD for ALK TKI
(alectinib), Bcr-Abl TKI (imatinib), and Janus
kinase (JAK) inhibitor (tofacitinib) ranged from 2
to 3 months. The median onset times of the DILD for
the multiple receptor TKI, which included PDGFR
inhibition and VEGFR inhibition (sunitinib and
sorafenib), ranged from 8 to 9 months.
Weibull distributions for these drugs when using
the cluster analysis showed that there were 4 clusters.
Cluster 1 described a subgroup with early to later onset DILD (median onset time from 8 to 93 d and scale
parameter from 19.0 to 203) and early failure type
proˆles (increase in the hazard at an early stage fol-

233

lowed by a decrease) or a random failure type proˆle
(the hazard was estimated to be constant over time),
which included the proteasome inhibitor (bortezomib), Bcr-Abl TKI (dasatinib, nilotinib, and imatinib), JAK inhibitor (tofacitinib), and ErbB family
TKI (lapatinib). Cluster 2 described a subgroup with
an early onset DILD (median onset time from 21 to
35 d and scale parameter from 34.7 to 49.3) and early
failure type proˆles or a random failure type proˆle,
which included EGFR TKI (erlotinib and geˆtinib),
ALK TKI (crizotinib), ErbB family inhibitor
(afatinib), and mTOR inhibitor (temsirolimus).
Cluster 3 described a subgroup with a later onset time
(median onset time from 34.5 to 67 d and a scale
parameter from 44.7 to 102) and a random failure
type proˆle or wear out failure type proˆles (the hazard was considered to increase over time), which included the EGFR TKI (osimertinib), mTOR inhibitor (everolimus), and ALK TKI (alectinib). Cluster 4
was described as a subgroup with the latest onset
DILD (median onset time from 247 to 262 d and scale
parameter ranging from 308 to 333) and an early
failure type proˆle or a random failure type proˆle,
which included the multiple receptor TKI with both
PDGFR and VEGFR inhibition (sunitinib and
sorafenib). Thus, it appears that the diŠerences observed between the clusters may be indicative of the
mechanism of action for some of these small molecule
molecularly-targeted drugs. Based on these ˆndings,
further research will need to be undertaken that examines the association between the mechanism of action
for these drugs and the time-to-onset of the DILD.
However, any subsequent research will need to take
the following reported ˆndings into consideration
when attempting to draw conclusions on the mechanism of action and time-to-onset. Abe et al. reported
that any interpretation of data from small sample
sizes (notably, less than 100 case reports) should be
performed cautiously.17) Thus, it should be noted that
there were less than 100 case reports for ALK TKI
(alectinib), Bcr-Abl TKI (dasatinib and nilotinib),
ErbB family TKI (lapatinib), EGFR TKI (osimertinib), and JAK inhibitor (tofacitinib) found in
JADER in our current study. Therefore, due to the
small number of samples, the variance of the regression line that was estimated by the Weibull analysis
would be increased. As a result, the ˆndings for these
drugs may not be conclusive. Secondly, the fact that
the time-to-onset of the DILD was only performed

234

using 16 small molecule molecularly-targeted drugs in
this study needs to be taken into consideration. Even
so, there has been a recent increase in the amount of
data being reported on molecularly-targeted drugs
that cause DILD, with a few of these cases reporting
on new small molecule molecularly-targeted drugs
such as bosutinib, vandetanib, lenvatinib, nintedanib, ceritinib, ibrutinib, and ruxolitinib in the
JADER database. Finally, while post-marketing
spontaneous reporting of suspected ADRs has proven
to be a valuable resource, it should be noted that
spontaneous reporting databases, such as the
JADER, are subject to various biases that include
over-reporting, under-reporting, missing data, exclusion of healthy individuals, lack of denominator, and
confounding factors. In addition, there has yet to be
any information provided on the total number of
patients who have been treated with these drugs.
Therefore, careful attention needs to be paid to any
interpretation of results from the JADER database.
Furthermore, associations between the physicochemical and/or other properties of the small molecule
molecularly-targeted drugs and the time-to-onset of
the DILD will need to be examined in more detail in
future studies.
In conclusion, results of the current study showed
that EGFR TKI, ErbB family inhibitor, proteasome
inhibitor, and mTOR inhibitor were associated with
an early onset of DILD within 1 to 2 months of the initial administration. In contrast, the multiple receptor
tyrosine kinase inhibitors, including PDGFR and
VEGFR inhibition, exhibited the latest onset of DILD
with onset times over 8 months. However, the onset
of DILD for Bcr-Abl TKI exhibited wide variations
(ranging from 14 to 93 d) with an early failure type
proˆle. The ˆndings suggest that the mechanism of
action for the time-to-onset of the DILD appears to
be associated with certain small molecule
molecularly-targeted drugs. Furthermore, the current
study demonstrated the range of times that DILD
may be found and the most likely time period that
DILD will actually occur in patients after the administration of small molecule molecularly-targeted
drugs, which is of great importance. As a result, these
ˆndings may potentially lead to a more concrete pharmacovigilance.
