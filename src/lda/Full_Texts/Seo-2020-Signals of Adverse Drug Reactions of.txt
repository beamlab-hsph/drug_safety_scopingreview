Abstract
Background and Objectives Schizophrenia is a severe public health problem and one of the top ten causes of disability, affecting about 1.1% of the world’s population. Paliperidone is a new atypical antipsychotic used to treat schizophrenia. Several
case reports about unexpected adverse drug reactions of paliperidone have been consistently reported around the world. The
purpose of this study was to detect signals of adverse events (AEs) after paliperidone treatment using the Korea Institute of
Drug Safety and Risk Management–Korea Adverse Event Reporting System database (KIDS-KD).
Methods We applied data-mining techniques based on a disproportionality analysis to KIDS-KD consisting of spontaneously reported AE reports related to atypical antipsychotics between January 2009 and December 2018. We calculated three
data-mining indices of paliperidone compared to all other atypical antipsychotics. We defined signals that satisfied all three
criteria of the indices. We checked if the signals identified were included in the drug labels for South Korea, the USA, the
UK, Japan, Germany, and France.
Results The total number of suspected AE reports related to all atypical antipsychotics in the KIDS-KD from January
2009 to December 2018 was 43,970. Among those, the number of AE reports related to paliperidone was 9453. Overall, 13
signals such as seborrhea, hallucination, obesity, gingivitis, and intervertebral disorder were classified into newly detected
meaningful signals.
Conclusion We detected new AE signals of paliperidone that were not listed on the drug labels of six countries, and many
that were related to psychotic symptoms, metabolic problems, and endocrine disorders.
Key Points
A disproportionality analysis using the Korean Adverse
Event Reporting System database showed meaningful signals after using paliperidone related to psychotic
symptoms, metabolic problems, and endocrine disorders.
These signals need further pharmacoepidemiological
studies to confirm a causal association.

1 Introduction
Schizophrenia is a severe public health problem and one
of the top ten causes of disability around the world, affecting roughly 1.1% of the world’s population; the mean life
expectancy of schizophrenia patients is 12–15 years lower
than the general population in the USA [1]. Among South
Korean adults, the lifetime prevalence rate of schizophrenia spectrum disorders was estimated to be 0.5% in
2016 and prevalent cases are increasing both globally and
nationally [2]. The socioeconomic burden of schizophrenia in South Korea is substantial; the mean total medical
cost per schizophrenia patient in 2009 was reported to be
US$3209 [3–5].
Currently, antipsychotic medications are used as a
first-line treatment of schizophrenia. Superior efficacy,
increased tolerability, and reduced relapse risk of atypical medications have been constantly identified and the
prescription of atypical antipsychotics has increased far

ahead of typical antipsychotics overall [6]. Paliperidone is
a relatively new atypical antipsychotic used to treat schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder [7]. Paliperidone is
a benzisoxazole derivative and major active metabolite
form, 9-hydroxyrisperidone, of risperidone, and is now
available in both oral and long-acting intramuscular injectable formulations [8]. It is a selective dopamine (D2) and
serotonin (5-HT2A) receptor blocker and its pharmacological effect to improve psychopathology, functioning,
and relapse in patients with schizophrenia has been proven
[9]. Paliperidone was first approved by the US Food and
Drug Administration (FDA) in 2006 for the treatment of
schizophrenia and was introduced to Korea in 2007 [7].
The recently developed long-acting injectable (LAI)
paliperidone palmitate 1 month and 3 months has been
approved largely because of its beneficial effect in improving patient compliance and reducing the relapse risk of
schizophrenia [6, 10].
The amount of paliperidone being used has been increasing with great efficacy and cost-effectiveness whereas safety
information about paliperidone in the treatment of schizophrenia has not been fully evaluated [11]. Since paliperidone
was first approved, studies to detect signals of paliperidone
adverse events (AEs) using national data have not been
performed, although some case reports about unexpected
adverse drug reactions (ADRs) of paliperidone have been
consistently reported worldwide [12, 13]. In 2016, it was
announced that 85 patients using paliperidone in Japan had
died [14]. Incomplete real-world information about drug
safety poses an obstacle to the clinical use of paliperidone.
Therefore, the objective of this study was to uncover
hitherto unknown safety information about the use of paliperidone. Specifically, we aimed to detect signals of AEs
of paliperidone compared with all other atypical antipsychotics using the Korea Institute of Drug Safety and Risk
Management-Korea Adverse Event Reporting System database (KIDS-KD) and check whether the signals are listed on
the drug label information about paliperidone ADRs in six
countries; South Korea, the USA, the UK, Japan, Germany,
and France.

2 Materials and Methods
2.1 Database
In Korea, the Spontaneous Adverse Drug Reaction Reporting System was first implemented by the government in
1988 and the Korean Adverse Event Reporting System
database was constructed in October 2012. The database is
administered by KIDS and whoever is authorized by KIDS
can access and utilize the data. We consulted the KIDS-KD

D.-E. Seo et al.

during January 2009–December 2018. This database
includes drug information, patient information, reporter
information, AE information, seriousness of AE, and causality assessment.
For systematic data analysis, the terms were standardized.
Suspected AEs are based on the World Health Organization
Adverse Reaction Terminology (WHO-ART) codes. The
drugs were classified according to the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) codes. These codes were developed
30 years ago by the WHO and have been widely used in
pharmacoepidemiology and risk-management studies. We
used the combination of drugs and Preferred Term (PT)
codes to ascertain signals [15].

2.2 Study Drugs
The study drug was paliperidone and the control group
was all other atypical antipsychotics. The study focused on
prominent AEs of paliperidone compared to the other competitive drugs in the same group and we designed a comparison of AE reports of paliperidone to those of all other
atypical antipsychotics that have similar pharmacological
properties of both D2 and 5-HT2A receptor antagonism in
common to maximize comparability. Typical antipsychotics
were not included in the control group because they have
different pharmacological features and usage patterns [16].
Atypical antipsychotics for which the AEs were reported to
KIDS-KD from January 2009 to December 2018 that were
included were amisulpride, aripiprazole, clozapine, olanzapine, paliperidone, quetiapine, risperidone, ziprasidone,
and zotepine.

2.3 Data Mining
Data mining is defined as “the application of statistical
methods to large databases with the objective of discovering new information” [17]. In the area of pharmacovigilance,
disproportionality measurement is one of the data-mining
techniques widely used to find AE signals in the Netherlands
Pharmacovigilance Foundation, the UK Yellow Card database, and WHO-Uppsala Monitoring Centre. We devised a
2 × 2 table, with rows classified with paliperidone and all
other atypical antipsychotics and columns indicating specific
AEs and all other AEs. We calculated to three data-mining
indices, the proportional reporting ratio (PRR), reporting odds ratio (ROR), and information component (IC) of
Bayesian confidence propagation neural network (BCPNN)
analysis [18]. PRR is calculated by the ratio of reporting rate
of one specific AE among all reported events about the drug
of interest, the comparator being the proportion for all other

875

atypical antipsychotic drugs in the database [19]. ROR is
defined as the ratio of the odds of reporting one specific AE
versus all other events for a given drug compared to the odds
for comparators in the database [20]. The IC of BCPNN is
the metric that converges to 0 when the drug and AEs are
statistically irrelevant as the ratio of the joint probability to
the product of the individual probabilities becomes 1 [21].
The criteria of “signal”, i.e., whether to define a specific
AE as a signal, depends on three indices: PRR and ROR of
at least 2, chi-squared value of at least 4, and three or more
cases, and the value for IC is a larger than zero lower limit
of the 95% confidence interval of IC [18, 22].

2.4 Statistical Analysis
We used data-mining methods that compare observed to
expected proportions of AE-drug combinations in order to
detect signals of paliperidone in order to search for neglected
or unknown ADRs using a nationwide AE database. We
applied all three methods mentioned above for signal detection targeting paliperidone because no single method is
known to be the gold standard [17]. The disproportionality
calculating measure compared paliperidone with all other
atypical antipsychotics. A signal was defined when it satisfied all three criteria for values for PRR, ROR, and IC.
We also analyzed the number and proportions of AEs
reported from paliperidone use and all other atypical antipsychotics per year and other characteristics including patient
sex, patient age, type of report, identification of reporter,
and reporting institution, and performed a chi-square test.
Finally, we identified the drug label information from six
countries and examined whether the signals were included
in the label. We reviewed signals that were not labeled in
the drug information for five countries and all six countries, respectively, and those of high reporting frequency,
i.e., more than 100 reports. All signals have the possibility for misclassification of the treated disease or symptoms
as ADRs, therefore, we considered the clinical aspects,
especially indications and off-label use of paliperidone and
symptoms of schizophrenia. Finally, we selected meaningful
signals as those that were unlabeled in more than five countries and have clinical significance excluding unspecific side
effects. All statistical analyses were performed using SAS
(Release 9.4, SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC, USA).

2.5 Ethics Statement
The study was exempted from review by the institutional
review board of Seoul National University College of Medicine (IRB No. 1911-051-1078) because it used secondary

healthcare data, which did not contain any personally identifiable information, and receiving informed consent from
patients was not required.

3 Results
The total number of suspected AE reports related to all
atypical antipsychotics in the KIDS-KD from January
2009 to December 2018 was 43,970 (Table 1). Among nine
drugs that were included in the ADR reporting data, the
most abundantly reported atypical antipsychotic was quetiapine (11,851; 27.0%) and paliperidone was the second most
commonly reported medication (9453; 21.5%). The year of
highest reporting rates of paliperidone adverse reactions
was in 2012 (3618; 62.7%) (Table 2). The number of AE
reports regarding atypical antipsychotics showed a tendency
to increase over years.
The characteristics of reports in KIDS-KD are presented
in Table 3. The reports about paliperidone and all other
atypical antipsychotics are presented by sex of the patient,
age of the patient, type of reports, identification of reporter,
and reporting institution (Table 3). All of the characteristics are different between paliperidone and all other atypical
antipsychotics (p value < 0.001). Regarding to paliperidone,
more cases were reported by females (5403; 57.2%) than by
males, people aged in their thirties had the highest number
of reports (2310; 24.4%), and research accounted for the
most frequent type of report (7474; 79.1%).
We calculated paliperidone AEs signals in comparison with all other atypical antipsychotics in the KIDS-KD
(Table 4). Compared with all other atypical antipsychotics,
insomnia accounted for the highest number of AEs reported
with paliperidone (616; 15.3%), followed by hyperkinesia (613; 15.3%), extrapyramidal disorder (413; 10.3%),

schizophrenic reaction (327; 8.1%), hypertonia (189; 4.7%),
amenorrhea (181; 4.5%), hallucination (167; 4.2%), psychosis (120; 3.0%), hyperprolactinemia (117; 2.9%), suicide
attempt (115; 2.9), and dystonia (114; 2.8%). Eventually, 40
signals were qualified by all three indices, respectively, and
they were compared with the drug labels from six countries.
There were 11 signals that were not included in the drug
label information of any of the six countries; seborrhea, hallucination, personality disorder, obesity, breast neoplasm,
vaginitis, uterine fibroid, gingivitis, intervertebral disorder, paradoxical drug reaction, and psychosomatic disorder. There were seven signals that were not included in the
drug label information of five countries; aggressive reaction, delusion, paranoid reaction, schizophrenic reaction,
hyperlipidemia, gastroesophageal reflux, and anorgasmia.
Finally, these 13 signals were classified into newly detected
meaningful signals.

4 Discussion
We overviewed the treatment-emergent AE signals of paliperidone detected through data-mining methods according
to PRR, ROR, and the lower limit of IC. The 40 signals were
qualified by all three indices, respectively, and 13 signals
were identified as new meaningful signals.
Insomnia was the most frequently reported AE signal and
was labeled in the drug information of five countries, the
UK was excluded. However, as Luthringer et al. presented

and placebo, paliperidone can improve daytime drowsiness
and sleep architecture in patients diagnosed with schizophrenia and concomitant insomnia [23]. Thus, it might be
appropriate to regard those AE reports about sleep disturbances including poor sleep efficiency and disruption in
sleep initiation and maintenance as typical characteristics
of schizophrenia, and paliperidone was prescribed for those
symptoms [24].

antagonists, including paliperidone, can cause extrapyramidal symptoms via their pharmacological action of affecting
nigrostriatal dopaminergic transmission [25]. If the comparators were all other atypical antipsychotics, not all antipsychotics, extrapyramidal symptoms might have been more
remarkable [26]. If they were not drug-induced movement
disorders, it is also possible that those extrapyramidal symptoms could be spontaneous involuntary motor symptoms of
schizophrenia [27].
Schizophrenic reaction, aggressive reaction, delusion,
hallucination, and psychosomatic disorder are thought to
be exacerbations of the underlying disease or one of misreporting of indications of medications as adverse reactions,
which commonly occurs in spontaneous ADR reporting
systems. Paranoid reaction, personality disorder, and psychosis are judged to be manifestations of the underlying
disease, worsening of psychotic symptoms, or off-label use
of paliperidone.
Suicide attempt and death as AEs of paliperidone have
received a lot of attention at home and abroad. In 2014, the
Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency of Japan sent
out an alert that 17 reports of death had been made about
paliperidone during a short period of about 5 months after
becoming available on the market. In 2016, the Community
Mental Health and Welfare Bonding Organization of Japan
announced after analyzing AE reports of injectable formulations of paliperidone for 3 years that 85 people had died
after treatment due to uncertain causes, heart diseases, suicide, etc. In this study, 115 cases of suicide attempts and 16
cases of death were reported and detected as a signal. However, paliperidone has a greater affinity for 5-HT2A receptor
blockade relative to D2-receptor blockade, and the blockade of 5-HT2A receptors of atypical antipsychotic drugs
in general is known to have beneficial antidepressant and
anti-suicidal effects [4, 28]. Thus, these cases may have been
related to natural symptoms of the disease or be the result
of discontinuation of or low compliance with the medications [14]. Nevertheless, the most common AE associated
with paliperidone is the onset or worsening of psychotic
symptoms including depressive symptoms, and the overall
incidence of psychiatric symptoms may be as high as 61%,
which might lead to a higher risk of suicide attempt [29].
Hyperprolactinemia is a well-known AE of paliperidone treatment. The tendency of antipsychotic agents to
cause hyperprolactinemia is linked to their strong ability
to antagonize D2 receptors on the anterior pituitary [30]. A
substantial increase in serum prolactin has greater effects
in women than in men, causing amenorrhea, menstrual disorders, galactorrhea, erectile dysfunction, anorgasmia, and
other sexual dysfunctions [8]. Moreover, breast cancer and
uterine fibroids, which are included in newly detected signals, might be related to hyperprolactinemia because they
are both influenced by hormones. Prolactin is significant in

the etiology of breast cancer and is used as an important
diagnostic biomarker of uterine leiomyomas. In the study
of Nowak et al., incubation of myometrial or leiomyoma
cells with anti-prolactin antibodies resulted in a substantial reduction in cell number, supporting a role of prolactin
as a paracrine or autocrine growth factor in carcinogenesis
[31]. Therefore, long-term vigilance for cancer development seems to be required in female patients treated with
paliperidone.
Several signals in the category of metabolic disorders
such as weight decrease, obesity, hyperlipidemia, and
hypertriglyceridemia have also been detected. Schizophrenia itself might contribute to an increased vulnerability for
the development of metabolic diseases, but researchers have
suggested that antipsychotics contribute to the development
of metabolic syndrome in patients with schizophrenia [32].
Regarding obesity, weight gain is widely known to be an
ADR of paliperidone and can be explained by an antagonist
effect of paliperidone at α1- and α2-adrenergic and H1 histaminergic receptors. Hu et al. explain that the weight gain
elicited by atypical antipsychotics derives primarily from
increased food intake. As a centrally active D2 and 5-HT2A
antagonist and also an antagonist of α1- and α2-adrenergic
receptors and H1-histaminergic receptors, various mechanisms have been suggested to explain orexigenic influences
of atypical antipsychotics [33]. The synergic effect of neuronal and metabolic changes including differential receptor
binding, changes in the gut microbiome, glucose metabolism, insulin sensitivity, and blood vessel-related changes
might contribute to the development of obesity, which in
turn contributes significantly to the risk of developing diabetes and cardiovascular problems, the most common natural
causes of early mortality in schizophrenia patients. Therefore this should be monitored and treated carefully and be
included in the drug label [34].
Seborrhea is included among the cutaneous AEs of antipsychotic drugs, which range from hypersensitivity, photosensitivity, erythema multiforme, licheniform, Steven Johnson syndrome, skin pigmentation, a lupus-like fixed drug
eruption, and seborrhea to pseudo-lymphomatous eruption.
Gastroesophageal reflux is recognized as one of the oral side
effects of antipsychotics [35, 36].
This study has the following strengths. First of all, this
is the first study to analyze paliperidone signal detection
using the KIDS-KD and to compare the signals with drug
label information in six countries; this database contains
all AEs spontaneously reported from January 2009 to
December 2019 in Korea. Second, this study focused on
paliperidone, a relatively novel atypical antipsychotic used
to treat the ever-increasing illnesses schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder, whose worldwide usage is increasing
with the major advantages of LAI. Internationally, the LAI
market keeps expanding in the treatment of schizophrenia,

and paliperidone usage and consequent AEs will likely
increase in the future as paliperidone palmitate 3 monthly
was recently introduced and is being widely administered
to noncompliant schizophrenia patients. Thus, it is important to provide unrevealed safety information about a new
drug using data that have representative power to help in the
selection of optimal antipsychotic medication among various
options. This study, using the real-world data cumulated for
a long period containing nationwide reports, is important
because the pharmacologic actions of atypical antipsychotics, including paliperidone, are considerably complex and
the consequences are hard to predict as many factors including underlying disease severity, mental and physical status,
and co-morbidities have effects and interactions.
This study has some limitations, as many other studies
using spontaneous ADR reporting systems do. First, information from the KIDS-KD, a spontaneous ADR reporting
system, consists of lists of potential drug-ADR problems
based on suspected associations, not on obvious causal
relationships. Therefore, additional pharmacoepidemiologic studies are needed to confirm the causal relationship
of detected signals. Second, the present study has various
degrees of under-reporting and the true incidence of signals cannot be estimated. Third, incomplete information
and delays in reporting are also factors that downgrade the
quality of signals. Fourth, the WHO-ART codes (PT) and
the actual disease may not match because they are chosen
by the user, and various clinical aspects cannot be considered to be sufficient according to the WHO-ART system.
Fifth, there is no information about the total number of
patients prescribed paliperidone and we cannot calculate
the absolute incidence of each ADR.

5 Conclusion
In conclusion, early detection of signals is very important
in drug safety. We found AE signals of paliperidone that
have not been included in drug information labelling in the
majority of six countries. Signals including seborrhea, obesity, hyperlipidemia, hypertriglyceridemia, gastroesophageal
reflux, and anorgasmia should be included in drug labels.
Signals including aggressive reaction, delusion, hallucination, paranoid reaction, personality disorder, schizophrenic
reaction, breast neoplasm, vaginitis, uterine fibroid, gingivitis, intervertebral disorder, psychosomatic disorder, and
suicide attempt need further pharmacoepidemiological studies to confirm a causal association.
