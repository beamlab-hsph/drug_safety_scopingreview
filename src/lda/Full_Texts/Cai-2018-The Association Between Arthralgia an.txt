Methods: We performed a retrospective study using a validated electronic medical record (EMR)–based IBD cohort from 2 large tertiary care
centers. The index date was the first date of vedolizumab or TNFi prescription. Baseline covariates were assessed 1 year before the index date;
patients were followed 1 year after the index date. The primary outcome was arthralgia, defined using NLP. Using inverse probability of treatment
weight to balance the cohorts, we then constructed Cox regression models to calculate the hazard ratio (HR) for arthralgia in the vedolizumab
and TNFi groups.
Results: We studied 367 IBD patients on vedolizumab and 1218 IBD patients on TNFi. Patients on vedolizumab were older (mean age, 41.2
vs 34.9 years) and had more prevalent use of immunomodulators (52.3% vs 31.9%) than TNFi users. Our data did not observe a significantly
increased risk of arthralgia in the vedolizumab group compared with TNFi (HR, 1.20; 95% confidence interval, 0.97–1.49).

Conclusions: In this large observational study, we did not find a significantly increased risk of arthralgia associated with vedolizumab use compared with TNFi.

INTRODUCTION
Joint pain, or arthralgia, is a well-recognized manifestation of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), with prevalence
ranging from 16% to 33%.1–5 As the focus of IBD treatment is
on life-threatening bowel manifestations, studies of arthralgia
in IBD are limited. However, arthralgia can cause significant

morbidity. Existing treatments for IBD include tumor necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFi’s) that systemically target inflammation and are also effective in treating inflammatory
arthritis.6 Newer treatments for IBD aim to be gut selective
in their immunosuppressive activities, with vedolizumab being
the first on the market.7–9 Since widespread use of the drug,
there has been concern about whether such gut-selective treatments are be less effective in controlling joint symptoms. In
some case reports, vedolizumab was linked to increased arthralgia; however, another study reported an improvement in
joint pain.10, 11 The objective of this study was to assess for
an association between arthralgia and vedolizumab use at a
population level.
Studying arthralgia in IBD is challenging because it is
not commonly coded by gastroenterologists. However, joint
pain is typically mentioned in narrative clinical notes. These
types of narrative data can be accessed using natural language processing (NLP). Briefly, NLP is a computer-based
technology that, when applied to narrative electronic medical record (EMR) notes, can detect and extract clinical information to generate structured data. For example, NLP can
process notes to identify which notes state that a patient is
having joint pain. This information can then be converted to
a structured variable, joint pain yes/no, to be included in an
analysis.

Background: The gut-selective nature of vedolizumab has raised questions regarding increased joint pain or arthralgia with its use in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients. As arthralgias are seldom coded and thus difficult to study, few studies have examined the comparative
risk of arthralgia between vedolizumab and tumor necrosis factor inhibitor (TNFi). Our objectives were to evaluate the application of natural
language processing (NLP) to identify arthralgia in the clinical notes and to compare the risk of arthralgia between vedolizumab and TNFi
in IBD.

The objective of this study was to test an approach for
efficiently studying a potential adverse outcome, arthralgia,
and its potential association with a relatively new treatment.
Additionally, we compare the accuracy of billing codes for
arthralgia against a standardized NLP definition.

METHODS
Data Source

Study Population
A retrospective cohort study was conducted by including
new vedolizumab and new TNFi users. The first date patients
received vedolizumab or TNFi was defined as the index date.
The 1-year period before the index date was the covariate
assessment period. Each patient was followed from the index
date until the study outcome, arthralgia, occurred or 1 year
after the start of follow-up.

Exposures
In the primary analysis, we adopted an intent-to-treat
scenario and categorized the exposure for each patient into vedolizumab or TNFi based on their drugs prescribed on the index
date. Patients were assumed to receive their drugs throughout
the 1-year follow-up period.

Primary Outcome of Arthralgia
Arthralgias were defined using the ICD9 code “pain in
joint” (719.4-719.4x). The NLP definition of arthralgia was the
concept unique identifier (CUI) for the main concept “arthralgia ” (C0003862), as defined by the Unified Medical Language
System (UMLS; release 2016AA),13 which includes commonly
used terms that describe arthralgia such as “joint pain.” From
the primary Metathesaurus Relationship File (MRREL),
we identified additional concepts related to arthralgia. These
related concepts, defined as “child” (CHD) concepts of arthralgia, included 36 concepts with descriptions of more than 20
sites or regions of joint paint such as “pain in ankle” and “hand
joints pain” and other descriptions of joint pain with different characteristics such as “diffuse arthralgia” and “arthralgia
started suddenly”. A dictionary was generated using UMLS for
the total 37 concepts mentioned above (Supplementary Table 1)

Covariates
We used the following covariates for confounder adjustments: age, sex, Deyo comorbidity index,15 TNFi, immunomodulatory agents and aminosalicylates, steroid use, baseline
arthralgia (defined as ≥1 NLP arthralgia mentions), and follow-up time for IBD.

Statistical Methods
To compare the accuracy of ICD-defined arthralgia compared with NLP, we performed a medical record review of a
random 100 subjects for evidence of arthralgia. We then constructed 2 × 2 tables comparing ≥1 ICD9 codes for arthralgia,
compared with arthralgia defined as chart review (gold standard). The same was performed for ≥1 mentions for the concept
of arthralgia extracted using NLP compared with the gold
standard. Performance characteristics were reported as sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value (NPV), and PPV.
We used the chi-square test and the Student t test to examine the differences in baseline characteristics between the vedolizumab and TNFi groups. To better control confounding and
preserve statistical power, we calculated the stabilized inverse
probabilities of treatment weights (IPTWs) for all groups and
weighted them in the baseline table and Cox proportional hazard regression models, using TNFi as the reference. A propensity score was calculated for each patient using a multivariable
logistic regression model conditioned on all covariates included
in Table 1. A stabilized IPTW was then developed by multiplying the IPTW in the vedolizumab and TNFi groups by the
marginal prevalence of the treatment actually received.16 The
mean of the stabilized IPTW was checked to examine outliers
and whether the cohort was weighted appropriately.
In addition to the IPTW-weighted Cox model, we conducted secondary analyses with an additional adjustment
for age in the Cox model and a subgroup analysis excluding
subjects with prevalent arthralgia during the baseline period.
Additionally, we used the NLP mentions of arthralgia, or
the burden of arthralgia, as an outcome to approximate the

We performed the study using data from the electronic
medical records of 2 tertiary care hospitals, Brigham and
Women’s Hospital and Massachusetts General Hospital. We
identified all subjects who received an infusion for vedolizumab
as of February 6, 2016. As a comparison group, we studied subjects who received a new prescription for TNFi in a validated
EMR-based IBD cohort consisting of subjects with Crohn’s
disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). The algorithm used to
classify subjects with IBD from the EMR had a positive predictive value (PPV) of 97%.12

containing different expressions of each concept. For example,
“hip arthralgia” and “painful hip” are different expressions of
the same concept, “hip pain” (with a CUI of C0019559). Notes
were processed using a published NLP software NILE to detect
and record any positive mention of the 37 concepts.14 Negated
concepts, for example, “no joint pain,” were not included in
the analysis. NLP data for arthralgia were generated for every
patient note.
We determined the performance characteristics of the
ICD9 vs NLP definition for arthralgia compared with gold
standard labels assigned through medical record review of
100 patients records randomly selected from the IBD cohort.12
A broad definition of joint pain attributed to any cause, inflammatory or noninflammatory, was used as a positive case of
arthralgia.

potential severity of joint symptoms. To do so, we counted the
number of visits with positive mentions of arthralgia during
the baseline period and 1 year after the index date. The number
of visits with positive mentions of arthralgia was divided by the
total number of visits during each period at the patient level to
calculate a “% arthralgia burden” for each subject. A signedrank test was performed for each subject comparing % arthralgia burden in the 1-year period before and after the index date.

Baseline Characteristics of Included Patients
We studied 367 vedolizumab and 1218 TNF inhibitor

ICD vs NLP Definition of Arthralgia
Among the 100 randomly selected patients for medical record review of arthralgia, the prevalence was 43.3%.
Compared with chart-reviewed labels for arthralgia, the ICD9
code for arthralgia had a PPV of 79%, and NLP had a PPV
of 90%. The performance characteristics were better for NLP
than ICD9, including sensitivity for arthralgia of 52% for
ICD9 and 83% using NLP (Table 2). Thus, for the primary
analyses to test the association between vedolizumab and

DISCUSSION

arthralgia, we used the number of NLP mentions of arthralgia as the outcome.

Comparative Risk of Arthralgia Between
Vedolizumab and TNFi
Vedolizumab users had a higher prevalence of arthralgia
during the baseline period (46.1% vs 28.5%). After weighing by
the IPTW, all covariates were well-balanced between 2 groups
except for the mean age (Table 1). The crude arthralgia rate during the 1-year follow-up period was 54.2 per 100 person-years
in the vedolizumab group and 40.4 per 100 person-years in the
TNFi group (P = 0.002) (Table 3).
The rate of incident arthralgia was 26.3 per 1000 person-years in the vedolizumab group and 24.9 per 1000 person-years in the TNFi group (P = 0.68). The mean time of first
arthralgia after the index date (SD) for the TNFi group was
0.31 (0.30) years, and for vedolizumab it was 0.20 (0.23) years.
We observed that the majority of arthralgia occurred within
6 months of initiating treatment in both groups (Supplementary
Figure 1A, B). In the IPTW-weighted analysis, the hazard ratio
for arthralgia in the vedolizumab group compared with TNFi
was 1.20 (95% confidence interval, 0.97–1.49).
In the secondary analyses, we observed similar results
when further adjusting by age or studying only subjects with
incident arthralgia after initiating vedolizumab or TNFi
(Table 4). Additionally, for both treatments, the burden of
arthralgia was generally lower after initiating treatment (vedolizumab: P = 0.048; TNFi: P = 0.009).

In this study, we tested an approach to assess for a potential association between arthralgia and vedolizumab use in a
large EMR-based cohort with clinical data extracted using NLP.
This study highlights a potential adverse effect where coding was
suboptimal in the EMR but is mentioned in the narrative progress notes. Our approach using narrative data to study arthralgia may explain why the prevalence of arthralgia in this cohort
was higher than previous IBD studies, at 43.3%. Although we
observed an overall higher prevalence of arthralgia in vedolizumab vs TNFi users, there was no difference in incident
arthralgia symptoms between new initiators of vedolizumab
compared with TNFi after adjusting for potential confounders.
We interpret these data to suggest the following.
Although TNFi therapies have a direct effect on inflammation
in the joints, extra-intestinal manifestations are thought to be
driven by gut inflammation.17 Thus, the therapy most effective
for the bowels will likewise have an impact on joint symptoms.
In line with this fact, we observed no differences in the rates of
arthralgia in vedolizumab vs TNFi initiators after adjusting for
potential confounders using IPTW.
When comparing vedolizumab with TNFi in the unadjusted analysis, we observed higher rates of arthralgia in the
vedolizumab compared with the TNFi group. The finding of
a higher prevalence among vedolizumab users was not unexpected. Vedolizumab is commonly prescribed after TNFi due
to insurance requirements demonstrating inadequate response

additional information on arthralgia, and the nature of the
arthralgia in IBD patients treated with long-term vedolizumab
compared with TNFi.
In summary, we performed a study using NLP to efficiently
assess potential associations between a relatively new treatment
and an adverse outcome, arthralgia, that is infrequently coded by
gastroenterologists. In this study of a large IBD cohort followed
at a large tertiary care center, we did not observe an increased
rate of incident arthralgia after vedolizumab initiation compared
with subjects initiating TNFi. More studies are needed to replicate these findings with longer-term follow-up.

disease duration and potentially had more severe disease, as evidenced by the need for vedolizumab. In turn, these subjects may
be more likely to have arthralgia due to active inflammation in
the gut and may have more opportunities to develop arthralgia
due to the longer disease duration. However, after adjusting for
potential confounders including follow-up time, no differences
in arthralgia were observed. Additionally, when studying only
subjects with incident arthralgia after initiation of vedolizumab
or TNFi, we did not observe a difference in rates between the
2 groups.
In the present study, we also highlight that applying
NLP to identify subjects with arthralgia improved the sensitivity for cases by 31% compared with using ICD9 codes alone.
Additionally, the standardized UMLS definition of arthralgia
used in this study yielded good performance characteristics
against gold standard manual chart reviews, with a PPV of
90%. This provides some data for the use of NLP with standardized UMLS definitions to screen for adverse outcomes that
are suboptimally coded in the EMR data.
A limitation of this study includes the fact that it was performed using EMR data from 2 tertiary care centers, which may
not be generalizable to other institutions. However, 2 advantages
to this approach are the large number of IBD subjects and the
ability to perform an active comparator design. Additionally,
the severity of joint pain could not be measured because it was
not uniformly measured at each visit. Thus, the study focused
on the presence or absence of arthralgia. Even with a formal
evaluation, clinically it is often difficult to distinguish drug-induced arthralgia from IBD-related arthralgia, underscoring
a potential reason for the paucity of studies in this area. To
approximate the burden of arthralgia, we assessed the number
of times arthralgia is mentioned before and after either vedolizumab or TNFi initiation, standardized by follow-up time.
In this small secondary analysis, we observed fewer mentions
of arthralgia after treatment. Thus, while the primary analysis
showed no difference in the rate of arthralgia after initiation of
vedolizumab or TNFi, the burden or frequency of mentions for
arthralgia was reduced after initiation of either treatment. Due
to the relatively small number of individuals in the vedolizumab
cohort, we did not stratify the analysis by CD or UC status.
Patients can have many reasons for joint pain.
Misclassification of joint pain from other causes such as osteoarthritis, if unbalanced between the 2 groups, could attenuate
any signals for increased arthralgia in any treatment groups.
The IPTW approach was applied to mitigate this issue. Lastly,
this study followed patients for up to 1 year. This was done
because vedolizumab is a relatively new treatment with limited
follow-up data in the EMR. We standardized the follow-up
time for all patients to 1 year to allow for similar opportunities to develop and have arthralgia reported in their medical
record. Additionally, based on our data, the majority of arthralgia occurred within 6 months of initiation of either treatment. Future studies with longer follow-up periods can provide
