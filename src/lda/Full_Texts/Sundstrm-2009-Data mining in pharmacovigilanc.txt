Abstract

Background: One of the most important aims of pharmacovigilance is to
detect signals of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) as early as possible. However, some ADRs are difficult to detect, one example being so called ‘type C’
reactions. These are effects that present as seemingly ‘spontaneous’ diseases
occurring during treatment with a drug, such as the occurrence of a cardiovascular event while the patient is taking rofecoxib. As this type of ADR is
often mistaken for a spontaneous disease, the causative agent may appear as
an innocent bystander.
Objective: The primary aim of this study was to investigate the possibility of
using data mining approaches to detect signals of ‘type C’ reactions. We
hypothesized that by including concomitant, and not only suspected medications in the calculations of disproportionality analyses, we would be able to
identify such reactions.
Study design: We used data from the Swedish Drug Information System,
SWEDIS, which contains spontaneous reports submitted by Swedish physicians to the Swedish Medical Products Agency, and applied Bayesian confidence propagation neural network (BCPNN) methodology to calculate the
information component (IC) value for drug-event combinations for drugs
belonging to the Anatomic Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classes cardiovascular system, musculoskeletal system and nervous system (number of reports = 51 270) where only the suspected drug was considered, and also where
both concomitant and suspected drugs were considered. We then classified
drug-event combinations that were signalled by a statistically significantly
raised IC value as labelled or unlabelled based on the approved summary of
product characteristics (SPC) in Sweden as of November 2007, and further
classified them as ‘type C’ reactions or not ‘type C’.
Main outcome measure: The proportion of ‘type C’ reactions signalled when
considering both concomitant and suspected drugs compared with suspected
drugs only.

Results: The proportion of labelled drug-event combinations when considering suspected drugs was 78.6%. Drug-event combinations classified as
‘type C’ reactions were more likely to be found when considering both concomitant and suspected drugs compared with suspected drugs only; 18/449
versus 0/248 when considering drug-event combinations that were signalled
exclusively by one of the approaches. Such drug-event combinations included, for example, sudden death and celecoxib, myocardial infarction and
diclofenac, suicide-related events and several antidepressants.
Conclusion: Including both concomitant and suspected drugs in data mining
practices may be a way of detecting ‘type C’ reactions earlier. This could
constitute an advance in data mining for pharmacovigilance practices.

Background
One of the major aims of pharmacovigilance is
to detect signals of adverse drug reactions
(ADRs) as early as possible and with minimum
patient exposure.[1,2] Spontaneous reporting of
possible ADRs by healthcare providers to regulatory agencies or drug companies is an important feature of postmarketing pharmacovigilance.
Such reports have traditionally been manually
reviewed and entered into databases, but since
the flow of ADR reports is constantly growing,
computer-assisted signal detection algorithms
(‘data mining’ algorithms) have been developed
to assist the reviewer in the detection of potential signals.[3,4] Such methods are usually designed to detect drug-event combinations in
excess of what would be expected if the drug and
event were independently distributed in the database (so-called ‘disproportionality analyses’).
As the control group, the background frequency
of drugs and events in the whole database is
used, whereby an observed to expected ratio for
each drug-event combination is determined.[1,4,5]
Once a statistically significant disproportionality
has been detected by such methods, the evidence
for a causal association between the drug and
the event is reviewed by a clinical expert, thereby
helping to assist in the timely detection of a new
signal. Many disproportionality analysis methods
have been developed, such as the Bayesian confidence propagation neural network (BCPNN)
methodology, empirical Bayes screening (EBS),

reporting odds ratios (RORs) and incidence rate
ratios (IRRs), cumulative sum (cusum) techniques, time scans, Poisson distribution methods,
and proportional reporting ratios (PRRs).[4]
None of these methods has been prospectively
evaluated, and there is no gold standard.
Missed or delayed signalling of important
events can have significant consequences on
public health, as exemplified by the association
between serious cardiovascular events and cyclooxygenase-2 selective inhibitors (‘coxibs’).[6-10]
This particular type of ADR is one of the most
difficult to detect. In principle, there are two
distinct groups of ADR, known as ‘type A’ and
‘type B’ reactions. ‘Type A’ reactions are effects
that are related to the pharmacological effects of
the drug, are dosage-related, and therefore most
are relatively easy to detect since they may be
predicted.[11] ‘Type B’ reactions are effects that
are often allergic or idiosyncratic reactions,
characteristically occurring in only a minority of
patients and usually unrelated to dosage; they are
often serious, unexpected and unpredictable.[11]
However, so-called ‘type C’ reactions are effects
related to an increased frequency of seemingly
‘spontaneous’ diseases that occur during treatment with a drug. In essence, ‘type C’ reactions
are usually ADRs mistaken for ‘spontaneous’
and ‘expected’ events occurring in the studied
population.[11] The example of cardiovascular
events associated with coxib use can be said to represent a typical example of such an event,[7,9,10]
where it was necessary to rely on large clinical
Drug Safety 2009; 32 (5)

Data Mining: Detecting the Unexpected

investigations to confirm the ADR. Thus, ‘type
C’ reactions are, as a rule, more difficult to detect
than reactions of ‘type A’ and ‘type B’ due to the
lack of a clear temporal association and that the
reaction also precipitates a disease that may often
arise spontaneously. Usually, large randomized
controlled trials, meta-analyses, or large-scale
retrospective observational studies utilizing data
from electronic health records or medical insurance-claims databases are required for their
detection. Signals of such reactions are often delayed and the drug may have been approved by
health authorities and marketed for some time.
Objective
The primary aim of this study was to investigate the possibility of detecting signals of a
‘type C’ reaction in a database of spontaneous
ADR reports that is moderately sized compared
with the large US FDA and WHO databases. To
do this, we included not only suspected, but also
concomitant medications in the calculations of
disproportionality analyses. In order to investigate whether this may be useful in detecting
‘type C’ reactions, we included truly unexpected
drug-event combinations where a concomitant
agent had been mistaken for an innocent bystander. This is a characteristic of ‘type C’ reactions and, to our knowledge, this has not been
previously described, although the approach of
not distinguishing between suspected and nonsuspected medications as such has previously
been utilized.[12] Since no investigation of the
performance of BCPNN has been undertaken in
ADR databases other than those of considerable
size, a secondary aim was to evaluate if BCPNN
can also be a useful tool in databases of moderate
size.
Study Design
We used data from the Swedish Drug Information System, SWEDIS.[13] This database
contains spontaneous reports submitted since
1965 by Swedish physicians to the Swedish
Medical Products Agency. As of 31 March 2007,
there were in total 102 728 reports in the dataª 2009 Adis Data Information BV. All rights reserved.

base. In SWEDIS, a Swedish dictionary is used
for coding ADRs. It is built on a three-level
hierarchical structure and was developed by the
Medical Products Agency. The first level is the
system organ class, followed by group terms, and
finally preferred terms. The dictionary holds a
little over 1000 preferred terms. We have recently
applied data mining methods to this database,
specifically the BCPNN method.[14] For the purpose of this study, and in order to arrive at a
manageable number of drug-event combinations,
only reports involving the Anatomic Therapeutic
Chemical (ATC) classes cardiovascular system,
musculoskeletal system and nervous system, either as a suspected or as a concomitant agent,
were considered (number of reports = 51 270).
The choice of these particular ATC classes was
made because they had been involved in a significant number of safety issues during recent
years at our Agency, and three different classes
were chosen to increase the generalizability of the
results to the entire database.
The information component (IC) value for all
combinations of a specific drug at ATC level 7
(substance level) and a specific event at the preferred term level was calculated. We created two
groups of calculations, one for drug-event combinations where only the suspected drug was
considered in the observed count, and one where
both concomitant and suspected drugs were
considered. Each drug-event combination with a
significantly raised IC value (IC >0; lower 95%
CI >0; number of reports ‡3), henceforth called
‘signal of disproportionate reporting’ (SDR), was
then compared with the approved summary of
product characteristics (SPC) in Sweden as of
November 2007 for the drug in question and
classified as labelled or unlabelled; thus, only
currently approved drugs were considered. An
SDR when considering only suspected drugs
(SDR[Suspected]) and an SDR when considering
both suspected and concomitant drugs
(SDR[Total]) was considered labelled if it was
mentioned anywhere in the SPC as a possible
ADR. Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) terminology was consulted on
those occasions when there was uncertainty
whether an event should be considered labelled or

with a significantly negative IC value (upper 95%
CI <0; number of reports ‡3), henceforth called
‘Negative Signal of Disproportionate Reporting’
(NSDR), and compared this proportion with that
of SDR[Suspected] in order to evaluate the performance of BCPNN in this database. We finally
reviewed all labelled SDRs in the two groups,
classified them as ‘type C’ reactions or ‘non-type C’
reactions, and compared the proportion of such
reactions between the groups.
Differences in proportions and means were
calculated with 95% confidence intervals. When a
signalled and labelled reaction was considered a
‘type C’ reaction by the investigators, we performed a search of PubMed and the home pages
of the Swedish and British medicines regulatory
authorities (the Swedish Medical Products
Agency[15] and Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency,[16] respectively) to
substantiate the classification. Search terms were

clinically more pronounced (e.g. vomiting) than a

considered labelled. No qualitative review of individual reports was performed, as the aim of the
study was to look at the relationship between
positive SDRs and labelling status. The proportion of labelled SDRs was then determined and
compared between the two groups.

both concomitant and suspected drugs compared
with suspected drugs only.
Results
Proportion of Labelled Signals of
Disproportionate Reporting

The number of drugs reported to SWEDIS as of
31 March 2007, stratified by ATC class, are shown
in table I. In total, 2373 SDR[Suspected] were
identified, and 3996 SDR[Total]. Table II shows
the number of SDRs in each of the two groups,
SDR[Suspected] and SDR[Total], in which the reported drugs were still on the market in November

2007. The proportion of labelled SDR[Suspected]
was 78.5% overall, and was significantly lower,
53.3%, when considering SDR[Total] (difference
25.2%; 95% CI 22.7, 27.8), although the latter
approach detected a larger absolute number of
labelled SDRs. Table III shows the proportion of
labelled SDRs[Suspected] (1904/1495; 78.5%),
compared with the proportion of NSDRs[Suspected] (107/182; 58.8%). The difference in proportion was 19.7% (95% CI 12.3, 27.1).
Table IV shows the difference in timing of
SDRs depending on inclusion (SDR[Total]) or
non-inclusion (SDR[Suspected]) of drugs reported as concomitant and not suspected in the
ADR report. The comparison is restricted to
those combinations that presented an SDR for
both calculations at the end of the study period.
For all ATC classes in the analysis, the proportion of SDR[Total] that occurred before the
SDR[Suspected] was significantly higher than the
proportion of SDR[Suspected] that occurred before the SDR[Total]. Furthermore, the difference
in timing expressed as the average number of
years between occurrence of the first SDR[Total]

and the first SDR[Suspected] was statistically
significant for two of three ATC classes. SDRs
occurring first for the SDR[Total] calculation
were, on average, significantly earlier than for
SDRs occurring first for SDR[Suspected], with
the largest difference for ATC code C: 2.0 years
(95% CI 0.6, 3.5).
‘Type C’ Reactions

Table V shows both labelled SDRs[Suspected]
and SDRs[Total] identified as possible ‘type C’
reactions. Such reactions were more likely to be
found in the latter case (18/449 vs 0/248 when
considering SDRs that were signalled exclusively
by one of the approaches).
Discussion
This study shows that nearly 80% of all SDRs
in SWEDIS were labelled when screening was
performed using the standard approach of considering only suspected drugs. This was significantly different from NSDRs, which were
labelled on about 60% of occasions. This type of
large-scale validation of a data mining tool
has, to our knowledge, not been previously
performed. It is therefore encouraging to find
evidence suggesting that data mining, even in
a database of moderate size such as SWEDIS,
may be a useful tool in pharmacovigilance.
SDRs[Total] compared with SDRs[Suspected]
exhibited a lower specificity, although the absolute number of detected SDRs was higher. Furthermore, the timepoint of those SDRs that were
labelled was significantly earlier for SDRs[Total].
Of particular interest, is the observation that
SDRs[Total] signalled SDRs characteristic of
‘type C’ reactions significantly more frequently
than did the traditional methodology of only
considering SDRs[Suspected] where the drug
was suspected as causative. SDRs of this type
included, for example, sudden death during
treatment with celecoxib,[7,9,10] myocardial infarction during treatment with diclofenac[6,8] and
suicide-related events during treatment with several antidepressants.[25,27] The choice between
using SDRs[Suspected] and SDRs[Total] may

therefore be influenced by a number of factors,
including (i) the overall workload of SDRs for a
drug, i.e. SDRs[Total] may be preferred if the
number of SDRs is low, in order to increase sensitivity, whereas SDRs[Suspected] may be better
where the number of SDRs is high and available
pharmacovigilance resources are limited; (ii) the
overall risk-benefit profile for a drug, e.g. a serious type C reaction will probably have a more
profound effect on the risk-benefit profile for a
cough remedy than for an oncology drug; and
(iii) whether or not a drug is used by a large
number of patients, and the general health of
these patients.
Much routine data mining focuses on the count
of SDRs where the reporters have attributed suspicion to avoid some false positives.[30] However,
in the quest for as much objectivity as possible it
makes intuitive sense to include counts of SDRs
regardless of suspicion as cases of interest. Thus,

ease, should perhaps be considered. As exemplified by the withdrawal of rofecoxib due to an
increased risk of cardiovascular events,[31] this
type of ADR is one of the most difficult to detect,
as the event is often mistaken for a spontaneous
disease, making the causative agent appear as
an innocent bystander – characteristics that are
typical for ‘type C’ reactions.[11]
Some limitations of this study should be discussed. Firstly, SDRs were considered true or
false according to the approved Swedish SPCs.
Some ADRs will be labelled but the causal link
between drug and adverse event may still be
questioned; conversely, unlabelled ADRs highlighted by data mining calculations may not necessarily be false, but represent very rare ADRs
that have not yet been detected. This definition of
what is or is not an established ADR could affect
the assessments of the proportions of labelled
SDRs in this study. Secondly, the high proportion of labelled SDRs observed in this study may
have been affected by publication bias; it was

not possible to obtain data regarding dates for
labelling changes to examine this possibility.
However, any influence of publication bias on
the difference between SDR[Suspected] and
SDR[Total] would be likely to reduce the observed difference between the two methodologies,
thus rendering this potential bias of lesser importance. Thirdly, as a ‘type C’ reaction is defined
as one that resembles a spontaneous disease,
its definition gives room for subjective interpretations. Thus, the classification of an SDR
as a ‘type C’ reaction is influenced by subjective
assessment and may differ between assessors.
However, we consider the difference in proportion of unique SDRs assessed as ‘type C’ reactions between SDRs[Total] and SDRs[Suspected]
as sufficiently large to consider the two approaches relevantly different. Fourthly, as only
the ATC classes C, N and M were investigated in
this study, it is not fully certain that the results
can be generalized to all ATC classes.
Conclusions
We conclude that data mining with BCPNN
can be a useful tool in pharmacovigilance, even in
databases of moderate size, with an almost 80%
chance of an SDR[Suspected] being labelled. We
further conclude that taking into consideration
both concomitant and suspected drugs in data
mining practices may be a way of detecting ‘type
C’ reactions earlier, at least in a database the size
of SWEDIS. This could constitute an advance in
data mining for pharmacovigilance practices.
Further work would be needed to generalize this
finding to datasets of different sizes.
