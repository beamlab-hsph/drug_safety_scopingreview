Background. In December 2009, a new high-dose, trivalent, inactivated influenza vaccine (TIV-HD) was
licensed for adults aged $65 years. We characterized clinical patterns of reports to the Vaccine Adverse Event
Reporting System (VAERS) among older adults who received TIV-HD.
Methods. We searched VAERS for reports involving persons aged $65 years who received TIV-HD or TIV
(standard dose) from 1 July 2010 through 31 December 2010. Medical records were requested for serious reports
(ie, those associated with death, hospitalization or prolonged hospitalization, life-threatening illness, or disability).
Clinicians reviewed information and assigned a diagnostic category to each report. Empirical Bayesian data mining
was used to identify disproportional reporting following TIV-HD in VAERS. Reporting rates were calculated for
reports of Guillain-Barré syndrome and anaphylaxis.
Results. VAERS received 606 reports after TIV-HD in persons aged $65 years (8.2% of reports involved serious
events). The number of reports yielded by searches using the terms ‘‘ocular hyperemia’’ and ‘‘vomiting’’ exceeded
the data mining threshold; .80% of these reports were nonserious. Clinical review of serious reports found that
a greater proportion involving gastrointestinal events were made after TIV-HD receipt (5 of 51 [9.8%]) than after
TIV receipt (1 of 123 [0.8%]). Four persons who received TIV-HD had gastroenteritis, and 1 had multiple
gastrointestinal symptoms; all recovered. A higher proportion of cardiac events were noted after receipt of TIV-HD
(9 of 51 [17.6%]) than after receipt of TIV (6 of 123 [4.9%]). No concerning clinical pattern was apparent. The
reporting rates of Guillain-Barré syndrome and anaphylaxis after TIV-HD receipt were 1.4 and 1.0 reports per
million doses distributed, respectively.
Conclusions. During the first year after US licensure of TIV-HD, no new serious safety concerns were identified
in VAERS. Our analyses suggested a clinically important imbalance between the reported and expected number of
gastrointestinal events after TIV-HD receipt. Future studies should assess this potential association.

On 23 December 2009, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) licensed a new high-dose, trivalent, inactivated influenza vaccine (TIV-HD) (Fluzone High
Dose; Sanofi Pasteur) for use in adults aged $65 years,
which contained 4 times the standard concentration
of hemagglutinin, an influenza virus protein that
elicits the formation of antibodies that inhibit viral
attachment to cells [1–6]. Subsequently, the Advisory
Committee on Immunization Practices included the
TIV-HD formulation for adults aged $65 years in its

recommendations for the influenza 2010–2011 season [1]; the
advisory committee has not stated a preference for TIV (standard dose) or TIV-HD for this age group.
Although prelicensure trials have shown that TIV-HD has
an acceptable safety profile, rare adverse events may not have
been adequately evaluated because of sample size limitations.
To identify potential safety concerns that may not have been
detected during prelicensure trials, we conducted surveillance
of adverse events reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) after receipt of TIV-HD by adults
during the 2010–2011 influenza season.

VAERS Background and Reporting

VAERS is a national spontaneous reporting system coadministered by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Food and Drug Administration that receives
reports of adverse events that occur after vaccination [7].
VAERS generally cannot assess whether the adverse event is
causally associated with vaccine receipt, but it may be useful
for detecting signals of potential vaccine safety problems.
VAERS accepts reports from vaccine manufacturers, healthcare providers, vaccine recipients, and others. The VAERS
report form collects information that includes the type of
vaccine(s) received and the adverse event experience. Signs and
symptoms of adverse events are coded by trained personnel
and entered into a database, using the Medical Dictionary for
Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) [8]. A VAERS report may be
assigned $1 MedDRA preferred term. A report is classified as
serious on the basis of the Code of Federal Regulations if one
of the following events is reported: death, life-threatening
illness, hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization, or
permanent disability [9]. For serious reports from sources
other than manufacturers, medical records are routinely requested by VAERS personnel for review.
We analyzed VAERS reports received by 28 February 2011
that involved individuals who received TIV-HD or TIV during
1 July 2010 through 31 December 31. Non-US reports and
duplicate reports were excluded.
Clinical Review of Reports

We reviewed all reports of adverse events that occurred after receipt of TIV-HD. We also reviewed all serious reports among
persons aged $65 years who received TIV during the study period,
as well as a random sample of nonserious reports in this group.
Medical records were requested for all serious reports from
nonmanufacturers and for persons with a clinical presentation
suggestive of Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) or anaphylaxis
(after TIV-HD receipt). Medical officers (P. M., J. A., and M. C.)
reviewed the VAERS reports and, on the basis of the primary

Data Mining

We used empirical Bayesian (EB) data mining [14] to identify
adverse events reported more frequently than expected in the
VAERS database following receipt of TIV-HD during the
2010–2011 influenza season by persons aged $65 years. All
inactivated vaccines, including reports involving TIV but not
TIV-HD, were used as the background for the data mining.
Persons who received any live vaccine with the inactivated
vaccines were excluded from the analysis. We used published
criteria [15] to identify TIV-HD–adverse event pairs with
reporting proportions greater than twice that of all other
vaccines (ie, lower bound of the 90% confidence interval
[EB05] .2). Clinical reviews were conducted for MedDRA
terms with an EB05 .2.
Reporting Rates

Crude reporting rates for GBS and anaphylaxis were estimated
by dividing the number of verified reports of these conditions
by the number of doses of TIV-HD distributed by the manufacturer during the 2010–2011 influenza season [16].
Because VAERS is a routine surveillance program that does not
meet the definition of research, it is not subject to institutional
review board review and informed consent requirements.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

event (ie, the event that appeared to trigger the reporter to
report to VAERS), categorized reports into one of the following
diagnostic categories modified from a system previously
described [10]: allergic (including anaphylaxis); cardiovascular (including cerebrovascular accident); ear, nose, throat,
gastrointestinal; local reaction at the injection site; musculoskeletal; neurologic (including GBS); psychiatric; respiratory
(including influenza-like illness, pneumonia, and noninfectious upper/lower respiratory tract conditions); other infectious; other noninfectious (eg, syncope and diabetes); and
death [10]. When discharge summaries were available, we used
the primary diagnosis to assign the category.
For TIV-HD and TIV, reports that were suggestive of anaphylaxis or GBS were verified using the Brighton Collaboration
criteria or a physician’s diagnosis [11, 12]. Cause of death was
determined from information documented in the autopsy
report, the death certificate, or the medical record. We made
no attempt to assess causality of the reported adverse events.
A sample of nonserious VAERS reports and all serious reports
involving adults aged $65 years who received TIV during the
2010–2011 season were also reviewed and categorized into the
same diagnostic categories. We used reporting odds ratios
(RORs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs), an analytic
method used in pharmacovigilance studies [13], to assess each
diagnostic category for an imbalance in reports between adults
aged $65 years who received TIV-HD and those who received
TIV.

Diagnoses included 4 reports of local reactions at injection site, 3 reports of
systemic reactions, 2 reports of nonanaphylaxis allergic reactions, and 1 report
each of neck pain, shoulder pain, nausea and vomiting, abdominal distension,
diarrhea; 1 report had no adverse event. Three of 15 were pediatric patients
aged 4, 7, and 10 years. Seven were aged 55–64 years.

RESULTS
VAERS received 622 reports after TIV-HD receipt; 606 (97.4%)
involved persons aged $65 years (Table 1). Fifty-one (8%) of
622 reports were coded as serious, which included 3 deaths.
In 49 (96%) of 51 serious reports, the primary diagnosis was
verified by review of medical records. The median time between onset of the adverse event and submission as a serious
report was 9 days (range, 1–80 days). The most frequent
MedDRA-preferred terms associated with persons aged $65 years
were vomiting and dyspnea, occurring in 37% and 35% of
serious reports, respectively, and chills and fever, occurring in
25.4% and 25.2% of nonserious reports, respectively (Table 2)

Table 4 shows the main diagnosis for serious reports made
after TIV-HD and TIV receipt among persons aged $65 years.
Among the 3 deaths that occurred after TIV-HD receipt, the
reported cause of death was sepsis in 1 and coronary artery
disease in 2. A greater proportion of serious reports was observed for the diagnostic categories gastrointestinal (5 of 51
[10%] after TIV-HD vs 1 of 123 [1%] after TIV; ROR, 13.0
[95% CI, 1.4–632.2]) and cardiac (9 of 51 [18%] after TIV-HD
vs 6 of 123 [5%] after TIV; ROR, 4.1 [95% CI, 1.2–15.0]). Four
persons who received TIV-HD had gastroenteritis, and 1 had
multiple gastrointestinal symptoms after vaccination; all recovered. All 9 patients for whom the serious report contained
a cardiac diagnosis had preexisting cardiac conditions. No
consistent cardiac diagnostic condition of concern was observed among these 9 reports (Table 4). Six of 9 cardiac patients
had recovered by the time the VAERS form was submitted.

A higher proportion of serious reports of neurological conditions were made after TIV receipt (54 of 123 [44%]) than
after TIV-HD receipt (7 of 51 [14%]; ROR, 0.2 [95% CI,
.1–.5]); the most common neurological diagnosis in both
the TIV and TIV-HD groups was GBS. Of the 5 reports of
GBS after TIV-HD receipt, 3 were confirmed as Brighton
level 2, and 2 were confirmed as Brighton level 3, one of
which included a Miller-Fisher variant of GBS. In 4 of the 5
GBS reports, the interval between vaccination and onset of
symptoms was #42 days. In one report, the interval was not
clear but appeared to be ,5 days. Higher proportions of
serious reports were also observed after TIV-HD receipt,
compared with after TIV receipt, under the diagnostic categories allergy and other noninfectious. Other noninfectious
is a nonspecific category comprising diverse diagnoses (eg,
syncope and renal failure). No pattern of concern was identified in either group.
Nonserious Reports After TIV-HD Receipt

Table 5 shows the distribution of diagnostic categories for all
TIV-HD–associated nonserious reports and a random sample
of 93 TIV-associated nonserious reports involving subjects
aged $65 years. For TIV-HD, the predominant diagnostic
categories were other noninfectious (eg, syncope and diabetes),
local reactions, allergic, and respiratory, which together made
up 86% of all reports. In the respiratory category, a greater
proportion of reports (73 of 555 [13.2%]) were identified after

influenza-like illness. Thirty-nine of 55 persons (71%) had
recovered by the time the VAERS form was submitted.
Data Mining

In the data mining analysis, only the MedDRA-preferred
terms ‘‘ocular hyperemia’’ and ‘‘vomiting’’ exceeded the EB05
threshold in reports made after TIV-HD receipt. Among the
34 reports of ocular hyperemia, 32 (94%) were nonserious.
Twenty-eight of these 32 persons (88%) recovered by the time
the VAERS form was submitted; cases in 17 of 32 were categorized as nonanaphylaxis allergic reactions. The 2 serious reports with the preferred term ‘‘ocular hyperemia’’ involved one
patient who was hospitalized for experiencing syncope and
subsequently recovered and another who had exacerbation of
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and an unknown recovery

status. We assessed the 34 reports of ocular hyperemia for the
potential presence of oculorespiratory syndrome, using a stringent Canadian case definition [17]. In an initial review, 16 reports
were found to meet this definition of oculorespiratory syndrome. However, review of the 5 reports for which medical
records were available showed that these patients received
diagnoses of nonanaphylactic allergic reactions from physicians. Of the 99 VAERS reports made after TIV-HD receipt
that contained the preferred term ‘‘vomiting,’’ 83 (84%) were
nonserious. Sixty-two of these 83 persons (75%) recovered by
the time the VAERS form was submitted. The main diagnostic
categories for these nonserious reports, which were based on
our classification system, included gastrointestinal in 36 (36%),
other noninfectious in 25 (25%), nonanaphylaxis allergic type
reactions in 14 (14%), and respiratory in 7 (7%). Sixteen of 99
reports (16%) with the preferred term ‘‘vomiting’’ were coded
as serious reports. The primary diagnosis included gastroenteritis in 4 cases, nonanaphylaxis allergic reactions in 2, sepsis
in 2, and chest pain, seizures, conjunctivitis, urinary tract
infection, renal insufficiency, reactive airway disease, respiratory
insufficiency, and anaphylaxis in 1 each.
Reporting Rates

From 1 July 2010 through 31 December 2010, 4 verified reports
of GBS after TIV-HD receipt were reported for adults aged
$65 years, with an onset interval of #42 days after vaccination.
The crude reporting rate of GBS for this period was 1.4 reports
per million doses distributed. During the study period, 3 reports

DISCUSSION
During the 2010–2011 influenza season, the first TIV-HD was
introduced in the United States for use in persons aged
$65 years [1–5]. Prelicensure studies had shown superior
immunogenicity for TIV-HD, compared with TIV. However,
rates of local reactions and fever were higher after TIV-HD
than after TIV. Therefore, the safety of TIV-HD was closely
monitored through VAERS. During the first year after licensure, 2.9 million doses of TIV-HD were distributed in the
United States [16]. As of 28 February 2011, VAERS had received 622 reports following TIV-HD receipt. Most reports
(91.8%) were coded as nonserious, generally self-limited
events. Consistent with prelicensure experience, fever, pain,
and headache were among the most frequent adverse events
reported after TIV-HD receipt [5].
As part of postlicensure surveillance of TIV-HD, we conducted 3 levels of analysis: EB data mining, clinical review of
VAERS reports, and reporting rate calculations for verified
GBS and anaphylaxis reports. Through use of these complementary approaches, we identified clinical categories in which
the VAERS data suggested the possibility that adverse event
reporting may be unexpectedly higher after TIV-HD receipt
than after TIV receipt.
Through EB data mining, we found that, among adults aged
$65 years, a greater proportion of reports of vomiting were made
after receipt of TIV-HD than after receipt of other inactivated
vaccines; most were nonserious reports. Similarly, our clinical
analysis of serious reports after TIV-HD receipt revealed an imbalance in reporting of gastrointestinal conditions, with a greater
proportion of reports occurring after TIV-HD receipt than after
TIV receipt. We noted that the MedDRA-preferred terms for
vomiting and nausea were among the top 10 preferred terms after
TIV-HD receipt, which is consistent with our clinical review and
data mining findings. Gastrointestinal events were not described
as occurring more frequently in prelicensure trials after TIV-HD
receipt than after TIV receipt [5] and were not identified as
a frequent coding term in a 15-year analysis of reports to VAERS
after TIV receipt among adults [18]. Postmarketing surveillance
done by the manufacturer revealed that nausea, vomiting, and
diarrhea were among the top 10 most frequently observed adverse events after TIV-HD receipt, which is consistent with some
of our observations [16]; however, there may be some overlap in
the cases appearing in the VAERS and manufacturer databases.

of anaphylaxis after TIV-HD receipt were reported to VAERS;
the onset interval was ,24 hours after vaccination. Two were
verified by review of medical records as Brighton level 1, and
1 was verified as Brighton level 2. The crude reporting rate for
verified anaphylaxis after TIV-HD was 1.0 report per million
doses distributed.

after TIV-HD receipt, in 4 the interval between vaccination and
symptom onset (42 days) was within the window of biologic
plausibility if a causal association were suspected [22]. The
crude reporting rate for GBS after TIV-HD receipt (1.4 reports
per million doses distributed) is below the background rate
for this neurological condition; however, it is expected that
there would not be complete reporting of postvaccination
GBS to VAERS. Data mining revealed no disproportionate
reporting of GBS after receipt of TIV-HD. There is no clear
explanation for the finding that the proportion of VAERS reports involving events that we categorized as neurological during
clinical review was smaller after TIV-HD receipt than after
TIV receipt. GBS was the most common neurological diagnosis in both groups. Our finding could be explained if the
TIV-HD and TIV populations had differences in baseline
health status that placed the 2 groups at different risks for
neurological events, irrespective of vaccination. Another explanation could be that reporting practices for adverse events
after TIV-HD receipt differed from those after TIV receipt.
For example, if providers were more likely to report cardiac or
gastrointestinal conditions that occurred shortly after the new
vaccine than they were for TIV, this could lower the percentage of neurological reports in the overall sample. More
information on health status of vaccinees aged $65 years
receiving TIV-HD and practices for reporting adverse events
after influenza vaccination in this population could be useful
to interpret this and other medical conditions.
Any finding in VAERS needs to be interpreted with caution
because of the inherent limitations of passive surveillance systems, such as overreporting or underreporting, biased reporting, and inconsistency in quality and completeness of
reports. Through our clinical review of all TIV-HD reports,
we attempted to obtain a more precise diagnosis of the adverse
events experienced, categorizing the adverse events in each
report into 1 primary diagnosis. Our use of RORs should be
taken with caution because of the small number of reports
involved and the inherent limitations of passive surveillance
data. Their use is only to assess for potential imbalances between TIV-HD and TIV with regard to the diagnostic categories in the VAERS database, but in no way should they be
interpreted as assessments of the level of risk or causality for
these conditions. Although we estimated crude reporting rates
for GBS and anaphylaxis by using doses of vaccine distributed
as a denominator, these estimates should also be interpreted
with caution since the number of doses administered is not
known and the completeness of reporting for these conditions
in VAERS is not known.
Fifteen TIV-HD nonserious reports occurred in subjects aged
,65 years. Although some of these reports may represent true
medication errors (eg, inappropriate schedule of drug administration), it is possible the reporter may have mistakenly

Through data mining, we also found that, among adults aged
$65 years, a greater proportion of reports containing the term
‘‘ocular hyperemia’’ were made after receipt of TIV-HD than
after receipt of other inactivated vaccines; most reports were
nonserious. Ocular hyperemia is one of the manifestations
of oculorespiratory syndrome, which was first recognized
in 2000 in Canada [19] and is characterized by the presence
of bilateral red eyes and respiratory symptoms (ie, cough, dyspnea, and wheezing), with or without facial swelling, #24 hours
after vaccination [17]. The symptoms described in 47% of reports with the coding term ‘‘ocular hyperemia’’ were compatible with this syndrome. However, we were not able to confirm
this diagnosis in those reports for which medical records were
not available.
While statistical data mining did not identify any disproportionate reporting for respiratory events, our clinical review
revealed a higher proportion of respiratory conditions in
nonserious reports made after TIV-HD receipt than after TIV
receipt. Three-fourths of these reports involved mild influenza-like illness, and almost three-fourths of the affected
individuals recovered by the time the VAERS form was submitted. Among serious reports, we also observed that the
proportion in which cardiac conditions were specified was
greater after TIV-HD receipt than after TIV receipt, but no
specific clinical pattern of concern was observed among the
cases. Because we did not identify a greater number of reports
with a particular or specific cardiac diagnosis that were made
after TIV-HD receipt than after TIV receipt, we did not deem
this finding in the cardiac group to be a safety concern after
TIV-HD receipt.
Anaphylaxis has a recognized causal association with influenza vaccines [20], and although it is a rare adverse event
after vaccination, its postlicensure surveillance is important,
especially for a newly licensed vaccine such as TIV-HD. Data
mining analysis did not find a disproportionate number of
reports of anaphylaxis that were made after TIV-HD receipt.
The reporting rate of 1 case per million doses distributed after
TIV-HD receipt is consistent with the observed incidence of
anaphylaxis #2 days after TIV receipt (0.45–1.98 cases per
million doses distributed) among all ages during the 2006–
2008 influenza seasons, as specified in the Vaccine Safety
Datalink [21].
GBS is an acute, immune-mediated paralytic disorder of the
peripheral nervous system [22]. The background incidence of
GBS among males aged $65 years in the United Kingdom and
the United States was approximately 5.3 cases per 100 000
inhabitants during a 42-day period [23]. Despite its rarity,
concerns about the risk of developing GBS following receipt of
influenza vaccines have been present since an association was
first noticed with the 1976–1977 A/New Jersey (‘‘swine influenza’’) vaccine [24]. Of the 5 verified GBS cases reported

reported TIV-HD when in fact TIV was really administered. It
is also possible the vaccine administrator may have chosen to
give TIV-HD to someone aged ,65 years. Vaccine records
were only available for 1 of the 15 reports (which involved
a 61-year-old women who mistakenly received TIV-HD), and
therefore it is difficult to assess whether these were true
medication errors.
This study describes the first year of postlicensure surveillance
for adverse events following TIV-HD receipt that were reported
to VAERS. We identified no new serious vaccine safety concerns
among individuals who had received TIV-HD. Consistent
with findings from prelicensure studies, we found conditions
(eg, fever and pain) that were more frequently reported after
TIV-HD receipt than after TIV receipt. However, taken together, our data suggest that clinically important gastrointestinal events, particularly vomiting, may be more likely to occur
in persons aged $65 who receive TIV-HD, compared with TIV
or other inactivated vaccines. Imbalances in the proportion
of gastrointestinal events reported were not detected in prelicensure trials but were also observed in another analysis of
postlicensure data [16]. Further studies to assess this potential
association are warranted. In addition, further monitoring in
VAERS and other systems for reports of adverse events following TIV-HD receipt during future seasons will be important
as use of the vaccine increases.
