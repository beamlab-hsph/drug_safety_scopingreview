Abstract
Objective—It has been suggested that there is a mechanism by which nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may interfere with antidepressant response, and poorer outcomes
among NSAID-treated patients were reported in the Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve
Depression (STAR*D) study. To attempt to confirm this association in an independent populationbased treatment cohort and explore potential confounding variables, the authors examined use of
NSAIDs and related medications among 1,528 outpatients in a New England health care system.
Method—Treatment outcomes were classified using a validated machine learning tool applied to
electronic medical records. Logistic regression was used to examine the association between
medication exposure and treatment outcomes, adjusted for potential confounding variables. To
further elucidate confounding and treatment specificity of the observed effects, data from the
STAR*D study were reanalyzed.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Results—NSAID exposure was associated with a greater likelihood of depression classified as
treatment resistant compared with depression classified as responsive to selective serotonin
reuptake inhibitors (odds ratio=1.55, 95% CI=1.21–2.00). This association was apparent in the
NSAIDs-only group but not in those using other agents with NSAID-like mechanisms
(cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors and salicylates). Inclusion of age, sex, ethnicity, and measures of
comorbidity and health care utilization in regression models indicated confounding; association
with outcome was no longer significant in fully adjusted models. Reanalysis of STAR*D results
likewise identified an association in NSAIDs but not NSAID-like drugs, with more modest effects
persisting after adjustment for potential confounding variables.
Conclusions—These results support an association between NSAID use and poorer
antidepressant outcomes in major depressive disorder but indicate that some of the observed effect
may be a result of confounding.

Two of the most widely used medications in contemporary clinical practice are
antidepressants and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (1), and the cooccurrence of pain and depressive symptoms is common (2). A recent report suggested that
NSAIDs interfere with some behavioral and biochemical effects of selective serotonin
reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in mice (3). The same study also presented an analysis of the
multicenter Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression (STAR*D) study of
antidepressant effectiveness, suggesting that NSAID-treated patients with major depression
were less likely to achieve remission with citalopram than patients who were not treated
with NSAIDs.
Since NSAID use in the STAR*D cohort was not randomly assigned, the risk of
confounding was substantial. For example, the indication for NSAID use, rather than
NSAID use itself, might have mediated the observed association with outcome, an example
of confounding by indication. Chronic pain in particular and greater medical comorbidity in
general are known to be associated with greater depression severity and poorer
antidepressant treatment outcomes (4, 5).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The strongest means of addressing confounding is a prospective study with randomized
treatment assignment. On the other hand, given the prevalence of depression and the costs of
treatment resistance (6), the proposed relationship between NSAIDs and SSRIs has
potentially large public health implications, making rapid follow-up analysis imperative.
Two alternative means of follow-up analysis to address the extent of confounding are 1)
confirmation in an independent cohort in which confounding may be addressed and 2)
reanalysis using rigorous control of potential sources of confounding. Our aim was to
conduct both types of analysis.
To accomplish the first, we used a tool for automated determination of treatment outcome in
large electronic medical record systems, the i2b2 (Informatics for Integrating Biology and
the Bedside) treatment-resistant depression framework (7), using methods that have
previously demonstrated sensitivity to other adverse treatment effects outside of the field of
psychiatry (8). We hypothesized that we would observe an association between NSAID use
and treatment resistance in more than 1,500 antidepressant-treated patients with major
depressive disorder. We then reanalyzed data from this cohort and from the original
STAR*D study to better characterize the potential confounding effects of medical
comorbidity on the observed association.

Method
i2b2 Treatment-Resistant Depression Cohort

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Cohort derivation—The derivation of the i2b2 treatment-resistant depression cohort has
been described in detail elsewhere (7). Briefly, the i2b2 system (9, 10) is a scalable
computational framework, deployed at more than 45 academic health centers, used to
manage clinical data. This tool was applied to the Partners HealthCare electronic medical
records system, which includes sociodemographic data, billing codes, laboratory results,
clinical problem lists, medications, vital signs, and narrative notes from Massachusetts
General Hospital and Brigham and Women’s Hospital, as well as community and specialty
hospitals that are part of the Partners HealthCare system in Boston. Patients with at least one
diagnosis of major depression determined by the presence of ICD-9 codes 296.2–296.3 in
billing data or outpatient medical records were selected for inclusion in a data set (referred
to as a data mart), yielding 127,504 individuals from approximately 3.1 million unique
patients. Next, we used a validated longitudinal classifier (7), that applies natural language
processing to individual narrative notes, followed by a set of rules derived from logistic

regression models (7) to identify individuals who either achieved remission with SSRI
monotherapy or remained depressed despite two or more antidepressant treatments.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Sociodemographic and clinical data for use as covariates, including age, sex, race, insurance
type, and selected comorbidities, were also extracted from the electronic medical records in
an automated fashion. A validated tool for estimating burden of comorbidity, the ageadjusted Charlson comorbidity index (11, 12), was applied, along with a measure for overall
health care utilization based on the count of total medical facts (the latter method has been
used in previous studies [8] and includes billing codes, medications, and procedure codes,
i.e., any single data point in the electronic medical records). Concomitant medications,
including NSAIDs, cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 inhibitors, and salicylates, were extracted
from the prescription list. The Partners HealthCare Institutional Review Board approved all
aspects of the study, and the usual safeguards for human subjects data were applied,
including data encryption, password protection, and elimination of patient identifiers from
derived data sets.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Analysis—Patients were considered to be NSAID-exposed if they received at least one
documented prescription during the classified antidepressant treatment period, that is, the
interval considered by the longitudinal classifier based on mood status in narrative notes (7).
The primary analysis compared antidepressant response between patients with chronic
NSAID use and patients unexposed to NSAIDs. For consistency with the previous report by
Warner-Schmidt et al. (3), our primary analysis examined all NSAID and NSAID-like
treatments (referred to as the broad NSAID analysis), while our secondary analysis
distinguished between NSAIDs, COX-2 inhibitors, and salicylates.
Crude (unadjusted) odds ratios for the association between NSAID exposure and treatment
outcome were calculated, followed by adjustment of odds ratios for potential confounding
variables, including age, sex, ethnicity (White versus non-White), and insurance type (public
versus private) (referred to as model 1), and finally the addition of comorbidity and health
care utilization measures, including body mass index, history of hypertension, history of
hyperlipidemia, history of myocardial infarction, history of stroke, history of type 2
diabetes, age-adjusted Charlson comorbidity index, and total number of medical facts
(referred to as model 2).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

As a secondary analysis in the i2b2 treatment-resistant depression cohort, the NSAIDexposed group was further divided into patients with chronic use and patients with
intermittent use. Patients who received more than two NSAID prescriptions (or refills) at a
daily dose (not an as-needed basis) within the study period were included in the chronic use
group, and patients with two or fewer NSAID prescriptions or those prescribed NSAIDs for
as-needed use only were included in the intermittent use group.
STAR*D Cohort
Cohort derivation—Details of the STAR*D methodology have been reported elsewhere
(13), as well as the methodology for examining outcomes across multiple periods or levels
of treatment (14). Briefly, STAR*D was a multicenter study of antidepressant effectiveness
in outpatients with major depressive disorder. Eligible patients began level-1 treatment with
citalopram. Those who did not achieve remission or near-remission status by 12 weeks were
randomly assigned to up to four sequential next-step treatments or levels. At level 2,
following nonremission with citalopram, patients could receive either augmentation (with
bupropion, buspirone, or cognitive-behavioral therapy [CBT]) or switch treatments (to
sertraline, venlafaxine, bupropion, or CBT). In our analyses, we focused on level-1
citalopram treatment, with one follow-up analysis examining the subset of individuals who
received CBT at level 2. The primary outcome measures in STAR*D were the Hamilton

Depression Rating Scale (15), for which data were collected at level entry and exit, and the
Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology–Self Report (16), for which data were
collected at every visit. Since data from the latter measure are more complete, they were
used in our primary analysis, which is consistent with other STAR*D reports.
In STAR*D, concomitant medications were recorded at every study visit. Medication
exposure was defined as at least one report of use of a medication in a given category at one
or more visits during level 1. Medication categories were confirmed by manual review to
correct a modest number of misclassifications in the original data set. Medical comorbidity
was characterized using the 14-item Cumulative Illness Rating Scale (17, 18), completed at
study entry. In this instrument, each of 14 categories (e.g., cardiac, vascular, upper
gastrointestinal, and musculoskeletal) is scored on a five-point scale (0–4=from no problem
to severe disability). In our analyses, we included scores for neurologic and musculoskeletal
symptoms, hypothesizing that they would be most likely to reflect painful symptoms. Since
the distribution of these scores was non-normal, with marked right skew, patients were
classified based on a score of 0 or ≥1 in each category in the primary analysis. Other forms
of coding of the ordinal values in sensitivity analyses did not meaningfully change results.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Analysis—Consistent with the analysis conducted by Warner-Schmidt et al. (3), we began
our analysis by dichotomizing patients based on their exposure or lack of exposure to
NSAIDs, COX-2 inhibitors, or salicylates during level 1 of STAR*D. We then performed
multiple sets of analyses to address the possibility of confounding effects. First, we repeated
the original NSAID analyses performed at level 1, with adjustment for potential clinical
confounding variables, including baseline severity, age, sex, ethnicity, and treatment setting
(primary versus specialty care), referred to as model 1. A second model examined these
covariates, as well as medical comorbidity as measured by scores on the Cumulative Illness
Rating Scale. Two follow-up analyses further explored the confounding effects of pain. One
examined narcotic use among non-NSAID-treated patients. The second examined level-2
outcomes among patients receiving CBT (alone or in combination with citalopram),
comparing those with and without NSAID exposure at this level.
Finally, we performed an additional analysis to examine the effect of NSAID intensity. The
STAR*D data set did not include measures of medication dosage or frequency, but date of
initiation was recorded. We therefore distinguished acute (initiation within 14 days of study
entry) from chronic/subacute NSAID treatment and examined its association with remission
at level 1 in the two subgroups, compared with placebo.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

We used the R statistical software package, version 2.14.1 (www.r-project.org) and Stata,
version 10.0 (StataCorp., College Station, Tex.) in these analyses.

Results
The first cohort was drawn from 1,528 patients with at least one billing code diagnosis of
major depressive disorder (ICD-9 codes 296.2–296.3) and who were identified as having
treatment-resistant or treatment-responsive depression using the natural language processing
single-visit and longitudinal classification algorithms. Of this cohort, 1,245 (81%) patients
were exposed to NSAIDs or NSAID-like medications, and 283 (19%) were unexposed.
Table 1 summarizes this cohort’s sociodemographic and clinical characteristics. Patients
with NSAID exposure were significantly more likely to be older, female, and non-White, as
well as to have public rather than private insurance. As anticipated, NSAID-exposed patients
also demonstrated significantly greater medical comorbidity and use of health care services.

Crude and partially adjusted odds ratios for association between NSAID exposure and
outcome category are listed in Table 2 and illustrated in Figure 1. NSAID exposure in the
broad analysis was significantly associated with risk for treatment-resistant depression. This
effect appeared to be confined to the NSAIDs-only group, since no significant association
was observed in the COX-2 inhibitor and salicylate treatment groups (Table 2). In the fully
adjusted model (model 2 in Table 2), which incorporated medical comorbidity and health
care utilization measures, the beta coefficient for NSAID use changed by more than 10%, a
conventional albeit imperfect indicator of confounding (19), and was no longer statistically
significant (odds ratio=1.17, 95% confidence interval [CI]=0.83–1.64, p=0.38). When the
analysis was limited to NSAIDs only, the effect in the fully adjusted model was likewise
reduced but remained significant (odds ratio=1.31, 95% CI=1.03–1.76, p=0.04).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

We conducted a secondary analysis in the i2b2 treatment-resistant depression cohort to
distinguish between chronic NSAID use and intermittent use. Of the 1,245 patients who
were prescribed at least one NSAID, 1,012 (81%) had chronic treatment (>2 prescriptions,
excluding as-needed basis only) and 233 (19%) had intermittent treatment (≤2 prescriptions
or as-needed basis only prescriptions). Demographic and clinical characteristics were similar
between patients with chronic NSAID use and those with intermittent use (see Table S1 in
the data supplement accompanying the online edition of this article). In the fully adjusted
model (model 2), patients with chronic NSAID use continued to have increased risk for
treatment-resistant depression relative to patients without NSAID use (odds ratio=1.47, 95%
CI=1.03–1.76, p=0.02), but no increased risk was observed in patients with intermittent use.
(For details of the results in the secondary analysis, see Table S2, Table S3, and Figure S1 in
the online data supplement.)
We next reanalyzed the STAR*D cohort to better characterize potential confounding
variables, particularly those that might mediate confounding by indication (i.e., medical
comorbidity). Patients who were exposed or unexposed to NSAIDs or NSAID-like
medications differed on most sociodemographic and clinical characteristics (Table 3). As
previously reported by Warner-Schmidt et al. (3), without adjusting for confounding
variables, NSAID exposure was associated with nonremission at level 1 in STAR*D (crude
odds ratio=1.23, 95% CI=1.06–1.44, p<0.01) (Table 4). However, in fully adjusted logistic
regression models including terms for Cumulative Illness Rating Scale severity in each
category, the effect size was markedly diminished and no longer statistically significant. We
observed a pattern similar to that in the i2b2 treatment-resistant depression cohort: the
significant effects appeared to be limited to the NSAIDs-only treatment group rather than
the NSAID-like treatment groups.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To better understand the potential for confounding by pain, we conducted two follow-up
analyses. First, we examined narcotic exposure among non-NSAID-treated patients in
STAR*D. Although this analysis might carry the risk of the same potential confounding
effects observed in the Warner-Schmidt et al. (3) study, it does not consider the same
molecular mechanisms. As we expected, narcotic exposure was associated with
nonremission (Table 4). We observed similar evidence of confounding; in a fully-adjusted
model, the effect was no longer statistically significant.
Second, we examined the effect of NSAID treatment chronicity in STAR*D. We defined a
priori a chronic/subacute treatment group (with initiation of NSAID treatment 14 or more
days before entering STAR*D, N=337) and an acute treatment group (with initiation of
NSAID treatment within 14 days of entering level 1 of STAR*D or during level-1 treatment,
N=262). In our comparison of the chronic/subacute treatment group and the no-NSAIDs
group, a significant effect on odds of nonremission was observed (fully adjusted model odds
ratio=1.44, 95% CI=1.10–1.90, p<0.01). In our comparison of the acute treatment group and

the no-NSAIDs group, a substantially more modest and nonsignificant effect was observed
(fully adjusted odds ratio=1.07, 95% CI=0.80–1.42, p=0.66).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Finally, we examined NSAID association with response to CBT in level 2 of STAR*D,
again to consider an intervention with a presumed different mechanism of action. Among
147 patients receiving CBT (alone or as augmentation of citalopram), 25 (17.0%) also
received concomitant NSAID treatment during this level. As observed in the level-1
analyses, NSAID administration was associated with greater likelihood of nonremission in
an unadjusted model, with more modest effects in a fully adjusted model, although none of
these effects were statistically significant, most likely because of the modest sample size.

Discussion

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

In this pharmacovigilance study using data from a large health care system, we confirmed a
significant association between NSAID exposure and poorer antidepressant treatment
outcome in major depressive disorder. In both of the cohorts we analyzed, this effect
appeared specific to treatment with NSAIDs rather than with agents that have similar
mechanisms of action. Importantly, we also identified evidence of potential confounding
effects using measures of medical comorbidity. In a reanalysis of data from the STAR*D
study used to support the original report of NSAID risk (3), we likewise identified evidence
of confounding using multiple complementary approaches. Notably, the outcomes with CBT
at level 2 in STAR*D revealed the same pattern observed for outcomes with citalopram at
level 1. This was surprising, since the mechanism of action of CBT is presumably not
through direct effects on cytokines. Likewise, citalopram-treated patients who were
receiving narcotics at level 1 were also less likely to remit, an effect partially explained by
medical comorbidity.
A body of literature suggests that general medical comorbidity is associated with poorer
treatment outcomes in major depression (5, 20). In particular, the presence of painful
symptoms seems to be associated with greater depression severity and poorer outcomes (4).
A portion of the observed effects in both of the cohorts we analyzed appeared to be
confounded by this phenomenon. However, a more modest effect remained even after
adjustment for these confounding factors.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Two key questions follow from our observations drawn from the two different data sets. The
first is whether the observed association, after adjusting for confounding variables, is
considered clinically significant and actionable. That is, should clinicians aim to avoid
NSAID treatment in depressed patients receiving antidepressant treatment? The finding by
Warner-Schmidt et al. (3) is scientifically valuable, even if it does not inform practice, in
that it elucidates a putative mechanism of antidepressant effect in vitro. One prediction
arising from our data set could be that salicylates and COX-2 inhibitors might be preferable
to NSAIDs when indicated for antidepressant-treated patients, absent broader considerations
of cost and safety. However, in light of the modest effect size we observed in fully adjusted
models, additional investigation in large cohorts or randomized studies is warranted before
practice can be altered in this way.
The second question is that of what the appropriate next step in investigation should be.
When pilot studies or pharmacovigilance studies identify potential beneficial effects, the
gold standard for confirming efficacy is considered to be a randomized controlled trial. On
the other hand, when there is preliminary evidence of harm, the next step is less clear. For
example, we would probably not proceed with a trial in which some individuals are
randomly assigned to smoke cigarettes. At minimum, based on our analysis, there should be

Gallagher et al.

Page 7

sufficient evidence of association to motivate further investigations using large independent
data sets, ideally ones with prospectively collected outcomes and detailed exposure data.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

A key limitation of our analysis is that, as with any data set that does not include
randomization, we cannot fully exclude unmeasured confounding variables. In particular,
while we are able to characterize proxy measures of medical comorbidity, electronic medical
record data are insufficient to identify specific comorbidities such as pain, which might be
more closely associated with NSAID use. In addition, while electronic medical record-based
data sets have the advantage of including rich data on medical comorbidity, they often
include only limited data on psychiatric comorbidity or on crucial details of
pharmacotherapy, such as adherence. Likewise, adequacy of antidepressant treatment can be
established by duration (7) but not necessarily by dosage. The precision with which
depression treatment outcomes may be assigned in these types of data sets is still less than
that of a prospective outcome study that employs systematic use of clinician ratings. The
systematic incorporation of scale-based measures in routine clinical practice would greatly
improve the utility of future pharmacovigilance studies.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

One notable aspect of our analysis could have led to an underestimate of strength of
association. In both data sets, there was insufficient detail available to reliably estimate the
daily dose, which precludes characterization of dose-response. On the other hand, in both
cohorts, we were able to estimate the chronicity of NSAID use. Confidence in our findings
is increased by the observation of a stronger effect in the chronic/subacute NSAID-treatment
group and little or no effect in the acute NSAID-treatment group.
Despite these limitations, we emphasize the potential utility and efficiency of electronic
medical record-based pharmacovigilance systems for rapid identification or confirmation of
risk, as well as the consistency of observations between our electronic medical record-based
cohort and the more traditionally ascertained STAR*D cohort. Our analysis was initiated
within 7 days of the initial report by Warner-Schmidt et al. (3), building on previous
investigations using the same methodologies to elucidate association between rosiglitazone
and myocardial infarction (8, 21) and between high-serotonin-affinity antidepressants and
gastrointestinal bleeding or stroke. By integrating across multiple large data sets, it should
be possible to detect early evidence of harm, which might then motivate closer follow-up
analysis in more targeted or focused data sets.

Clinical Guidance: NSAIDs, Illness, and Antidepressant Resistance

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Coexisting general medical illness accounts for much of the previously reported
association between use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and
nonremission of treated depression. Gallagher et al. found that a modest but smaller
relationship for NSAIDs remained when analyses included the comorbidity of patients in
a large health care system and in the STAR*D study of antidepressant effectiveness.
Resistance to antidepressant treatment is related to long-term NSAID use but not to
intermittent use or to use of cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors and salicylates.
Shelton in an editorial (p. 1012) suggests that the remaining association between NSAIDs
and antidepressant nonresponse is likely due to residual confounding from imperfect
measurement of medical conditions or incomplete adjustment for them in analyses.
