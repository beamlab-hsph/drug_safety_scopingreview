unknown relationships between drugs and adverse drug reactions (ADRs). A plethora
of statistical methods have been proposed over the years to identify these drug-ADR
pairs. The objective of this study is to compare a wide variety of methods in their ability to detect these signals, especially when their detection is complicated by the presence of innocent bystanders (drugs that are mistaken to be associated with the ADR,
since they are prescribed together with the drug that is the ADR's actual cause).

Funding information
Federal Joint Committee in Germany, Grant/
Award Number: 01VSF16020

Methods: Twelve methods, 24 measures in total, ranging from simple disproportionality measures (eg, the reporting odds ratio), hypothesis tests (eg, test of
the Poisson mean), Bayesian shrinkage estimates (eg, the Bayesian confidence propagation neural network, BCPNN) to sparse regression (LASSO), are compared in their
ability to detect drug-ADR pairs in a large number of simulated SRSs with varying
numbers of innocent bystanders and effect sizes. The area under the precision-recall
curve is used to assess the measures' performance.
Results: Hypothesis tests (especially the test of the Poisson mean) perform best
when the associations are weak and there is little to no confounding by other drugs.
When the level of confounding increases and/or the effect sizes become larger,
Bayesian shrinkage methods should be preferred. The LASSO proves to be the most
robust against the innocent bystander effect.
Conclusions: There is no absolute “winner”. Which method to use for a particular
SRS depends on the effect sizes and the level of confounding present in the data.

of the Poisson mean24) are to be preferred when the effect sizes are
small and there is no or little confounding. The moment when the level
of confounding increases and/or the effect sizes become larger, the measures based on the BCPNN1,13 perform best. Which measure to use for
a particular SRS, thus, depends on the effect sizes and the level of confounding present in the data. Since it is less likely to discover drug-ADR
pairs with an odds ratio around 3 or 5 that eluded detection before, it
seems reasonable to take special note of the results for the lower effect
sizes (OR ≈ 1.5). Due to their poor performance in this simulation study,
the use of ROR, PRR, and RRR is discouraged. The only method that is
robust against confounding by other drugs is the LASSO. Although it
cannot boast the best overall performance, it is not confounded by the
presence of innocent bystanders. It achieves this by considering all drugs
simultaneously. It would be very interesting to see how other sparse
28

regression approaches, for example, the elastic net,

would perform.

All Bayesian methods such as the GPS and the BCPNN use the relative report rate as their basis.1,13,24 Figure 1 shows, however, that the
RRR is consistently outperformed by the reporting odds ratio. It might be
fruitful to explore the possibility of applying Bayesian shrinkage to the
ROR rather than the RRR. By using a threshold-free performance measure, we avoided the problem of choosing an appropriate threshold for
the various measures.29 For some, it might be easier to choose an appropriate threshold than for others. It is, for example, unclear how to set the
thresholds for ROR, PRR, and RRR. For the measures based on hypothesis tests, one could employ a multiple testing correction procedure.25 In
case of the Bayesian methods, there are similar procedures to control
the false-discovery rate, for example, the study by Ahmed et al.18
A point of caution is that the simulation setup is a simplification
and might differ from the SRSs used in daily practice. Real data sets
can contain more noise. The results shown here should, thus, be seen
as a best-case scenario. In addition, one should not rely solely on statistical analysis. Clinical and pharmacological knowledge is essential
when identifying drug-ADR pairs.
