well as other information accessible to a company$ drugmonitoring system. Methods: The
hyesian confidence propagation neural network (BCPNN) and thegamma Poisson shrinkage (GPS) were applied to a selected sample of
spontaneously reported adverse events fdlowing the administmtion of a Bracco contrast
medium. Both the conventional approach and
sales data were exploited to represent the patients' population drug exposure. Results:

BACKGROUND
Over the years, adverse drug reaction (ADR) signaling (ie, any warning concerning an unknown
adverse medical event induced by a drug) has
been recognized to be a central issue in the field
of pharmacovigilance. Although the detection,
evaluation, and prevention of ADRs is undermined by the inevitable incompleteness of data
and information collected during the premarketing phase, the increasing amount of spontaneous case reports received allows the development of active methods that can be run on huge
databases, ensuring that ADR recognition is not
delayed, and confirming the spontaneous reporting as an alert-generating system (1).
Since reports are collected about individual
incidents with a link with a specific drug that is
generally conjectural, the safety of the drug cannot be investigated on the basis of the sole
count of individual incidents. To judge whether
the number of ADR reports exceeds what might
be expected through "pure chance," several

for any given adverse drug reaction, among different drugs. Conclusions: Without comprehensive data on the adverse events reported
worldwide for all pharmaceuticalproducts, signaling methods are appropriate to compare the

value of signals, improving the analysis of spontaneous reports cdlected ly a company monitoring system.

quantitative approaches have been proposed
(2-6).
Since 1998, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the World Health Organization
(WHO) have been exploring interproduct quantitative methods based on automated Bayesian
data mining (BDM). These methods work by
comparing spontaneous reporting for the index
product with spontaneous reporting for other
products. They include the gamma Poisson
shrinkage (GPS) developed by Du Mouchel (7)
and the Bayesian confidence propagation neural network (BCPNN) of Holst and Lansner (8),
which has been adapted and applied to ADR signaling by Bate et al. (9) and Orre et al. (10).
GPS and BCPNN are used, respectively, by the
FDA and the WHO to routinely screen the FDA
Adverse Event Reporting System and the WHO
lnternational Drug Information System databases to detect and monitor ADR signals (7,9).
Both methods have been developed for specific
drug-adverse event (AE) pairs at multiple time
points, thereby incorporating interval changes

into a time scan. This repeated comparison
technique enhances signal detection since an
upward change in the measurement statistic
over time implies an increasing awareness of a
drug-AE pair as time progresses. For a detailed
description of these methods, refer to Refs. (7)
and (9-12).
Interproduct quantitative techniques are generally believed adequate when applied to large
AE reporting systems like those found at regional, national, or international levels (4-7). In this
context, a single pharmaceutical company
would be the possible target of those signals,
whereas its faculty to interpret and to anticipate
such warnings mainly passes through the application of the same methods to its AE spontaneous reports database.
Since signals need always to be interpreted in
the light of the information provided by data
from which they are detected, this article discusses the authors’ experience with both the
BCPNN and the GPS computational methods
when applied to the database of AE spontaneous reports (AE database) following the use of
Bracco’s contrast media.

METHODS
The BCPNN and GPS approaches to ADR signaling provide estimates for two different measures, namely, the information component (IC)
and the EBlog2, for the association degree between pairs drug-AE.
The experiments were distinguished into intradatabase (the AE database, associated with
the information source S,) and sales-database
(AE database plus drugs sales database, associated with the information source S,) (13).
Intradatabase experiments fulfill the original
signal calculation (7,9), by which only spontaneous reports are considered. Here, the proportion of reports accounting for any AE to a specific product represents the relative exposure of
a population to that product. Conversely, in
sales-database experiments, signals were calculated by making use of sales volumes as a proxy
of drug exposure. Once performed on the BracCO’S company spontaneous reports, the original
version of the IC has the following meaning:

P(D = i , A E = j I AER = yes,DCS = BCM)
P(D = i I AER = yes, DCS = BCM)P(AE = j I AER = yes, DCS = BCM)

where D and AE refer to the observations of report about the drug i and the AE j , and the information exploited is restricted to the drug
class sold (DCS is only Bracco’s contrast media)
and to the adverse event reported (AER). However, focusing only on drugs for which an AE has
been reported might generally bias the estimate
of the exposure to a specific drug since the relationship between the frequency of reporting
AEs about a product and the product’s sale
might not follow a direct proportionality (see
the details provided in the appendix to support
this argument). When sales data are considered,
Formula 1 becomes
P
P(DS = I , AE = I DCS = BCM)
IC =
4=
P(DS = I I DCS = BCM)P(AE = j I DCS = BCM) (2)
”
P,P,

where the observations of volumes being sold for
drug i (DS) replace the observations of reports
for that drug (D), and the available information
is no more restricted to the AER. Formulas 1 and
2 are, respectively, related to Formulas 7 and 8 in
the appendix, where it is further explained how
probabilities of the IC are calculated.
As a practical tool for the analysis, Matlab 5
was the software exploited for the BCPNN,
whereas the software available at ftp://ftp
.research.att.com/dist/gps/ was adopted for the
CPS.
To obtain a stable experimental setting the
Bracco AE database was locked at a predefined
time point, and the following fields were selected:
drug active ingredient
system organ class (SOC) code
high-level term ( H E )
preferred term (PT)
date of onset for the clinical event (AEDOCV)

where the SOCs, HLTs, and PTs have been coded
according to version 5.1 of MedDRA (Medical
Dictionary for Regulatory Activities) (14,lS).

records relevant to AEs reported following the
use of five main contrast media (iopamidol,
iomeprol, gadoteridol, gadobenate dimeglumine, sulfur hexafluoride) were extracted from
the AEs database and validated through a data
cleaning (DC) procedure devoted to resolve data
inconsistencies or errors, to remove missing observations, and to identify duplications. After
the DC task was performed, the data set consisted of 34,323 observations (see Table 1,in which
the number of observations is represented by c
in the Counts column).
The ADRs signaling task was focused on AE
terms, either common or rare events, chosen to
deal with AEs representing the most relevant organ systems according to version 5.1 of MedDRA, which are listed in Table 1 together with
their respective counts ci.
Several comparisons between the set of signals obtained in each separate experiment were
addressed. In particular, for any given drug-AE
pair (i, j ) , a signal is considered to be positive
(suspected ADR) if the information component,
namely, ICjj or the Eblog 2, lower 95% confidence interval (95% CI) limit is above zero: in
the opposite circumstance, the signal is nega-

tive. This policy is referred to as the 95% lower
confidence limit zero crossover. Comparative
plots were applied to compare results from intradatabase and sales-database experiments
(drug signal comparison by PT BCPNN vs. GPS
signals; intradatabase vs sales-database experiments; temporal trend of signals by year).

RESULTS
INTRADATABASE EXPERIMENTS
Signals associated with the 55 tested drug-AE
pairs are reported in Table 2. Of 28 signals detected using the BCPNN, 3 (10.7%, with 95% CI
2.9-25.4) were positive signals, and 25 were
negative signals. Signals computed with the
GPS algorithm perfectly fit with signals obtained with the BCPNN approach. Iopamidol
was the contrast medium showing the highest
number of positive (n = 2) and negative (n = 8)
signals. The product also showed the lowest
number of "no counts" (n = 1).
SALES-DATABASE EXPERIMENTS
Signals associated with the 55 tested drug-AE
pairs applied to sales-database are presented in
Table 3. No counts cells were omitted from
calculation. Of 28 signals detected using the

BCPNN, 11 (39.3%, 95% CI 23.8-56.5) were
positive signals, and 17 were negative signals. As
seen with the intradatabase experiments, signals computed with the GPS perfectly fit with
those obtained with the BCPNN approach.
lomeprol was the contrast medium showing the
highest number of positive (n = 5) and negative
(n = 10) signals. lopamidol showed the highest
number of negative signals (n = 10)and the lowest number of no counts.

COMPARATIVE PLOTS EXPERIMENTS
The three most relevant plots out of a hundred
comparing signals computed using the BCPNN
and GPS methods are reported in Figures 1, 2,
and 3. As shown in Figure 1, gadoteridol and
iomeprol showed a risk profile higher than
iopamidol. A definite statement cannot be argued for gadobenate dimeglumine, as indicated
by its wide 95%CI, including the zero line. N o
positive signal was detected for iopamidol, as ev-

idenced by the IC value that always plots below
the zero line.
Overlapping lines in Figure 2 suggest a high
level of agreement between the two quantitative
methods for signal identification. The agreement
was observed for both the expected values for the
signal measures (EBlog2 and IC) and their 95%
confidence intervals, which are of comparable
amplitude. This level of agreement was substantially maintained for the overall set of numerical
experiments applied to other drug-AE pairs.
However, some marginal differences were detected when low count pairs were considered.
Figure 3 shows the shifting effect obtained by
introducing sales data. Indeed, the IC signal
computed using intradatabase data is lower
than that adjusted for sales data. The sales datadependent shifting effect, considering the
whole set of contrast media and adverse events
occurs in both the directions (ie, up-shift and
down-shift).

DISCUSSION
Several limitations related to the usage of spontaneously reported AE data make the analysis
using interproduct quantitative BDM algorithms dependent on the type of the data
source. Such limitations are widely recognized
in the specialized literature and include difficulty of AE recognition, AE underreporting and
overreporting, difficulty in estimating the mag-

nitude of the drug-exposed population, and
quality and reliability of reports (16-21). On the
other hand, these limitations do not prevent the
increasing adoption of the BDM algorithms as
useful tools in pharmacovigilance, especially at
the high level of internationally recognized organizations and health authorities that own
large AE databases and routinely screen AE data
to identify and monitor signals.

FDA) compute estimates for the information
component and EBlog2 by exploiting spontaneous report data collected and maintained in
their respective AE databases. Therefore,
BCPNN and GPS, when applied respectively by
the WHO and FDA, exploit an AE database containing report data related to a large number of
different drug types but do not access drug sales
data.
Conversely, a single drug manufacturer maintains two main databases: the AE database, containing spontaneous report data concerning its
own products only, and the drugs sales database, containing sales volumes for its own products. Therefore, a single drug manufacturer differs from international organizations (WHO and
FDA) for the amount, quality, and nature of the
available information sources that can be exploited for ADR signaling purposes. Little research has investigated the potential impact of
these peculiarities, although they can affect
both the interpretation and the estimate of
pharmacovigilance signals.
On the interpretation’s side, we found that the
detection of meaningful signals from a single
drug manufacturer’s database is far from obvious (3).To tackle the problem, it should be noted that signals are detected from cases that are
all exposed to drugs (the contrast media). These
probably influence the outcome of interest (the
AE), so it is more appropriate to regard the
group of nonexposed to the tested drug as a
contrast group rather than a proper control
(22). As a consequence, the 1C and the EBlog2
are expected to inform us about the relative
danger of a drug for a particular AE when compared to the other tested drugs belonging to the
same class (the contrast media). In our experiments, Bracco’s data set contains contrast media only, so that the data offer the opportunity
of a meaningful product ranking based on the
relative and specific toxicity of each assessed
drug. In this context, a signal would support the
choice of a contrast medium among other products sharing similar utility. This information is
essential from a clinical point of view and is not
replaceable by any absolute figure on contrast
media safety profile.

After the possibility of a meaningful interpretation of signals is confirmed, it is attractive to
see whether a company’s monitoring system can
provide information that could even improve
the estimate of pharmacovigilance signals. In
this regard, we have published an introductory
presentation of this methodology applied to a
small-size AE database (17). Sales data depend
on the proportion of utilization of products. Although this also applies to the proportion of reports concerning a particular association (ie,
the figure ordinarily exploited to calculate the
1C and the EBlog2). spontaneous reports alone
are known to bias any estimate of drug exposure
(18,19.21). Instead. sales of contrast media are
registered at hospitals’ drugstores, from which
new products rarely replace the old ones, so
that orders largely reflect products consumed.
Therefore, the proportion of a contrast medium
that is sold among others should be a reliable
index of the relative exposure to that product, at
least when time intervals of a year are considered. In addition, a simulation can show how
signal properties may be affected by various scenarios of data incompleteness. From this theoretical experiment, it would result that the exploitation of the sales database has the desirable
property of preserving the order of the risk for
harm among different drugs within any given
ADR (see appendix).
The adjustment with sales volumes did affect
the results of 10 of the 55 considered drug-AE
pairs. Whether or not sales volumes are considered, the experiment shows a full agreement between signals obtained with the BCPNN and
GPS methods. This recognition should make the
choice between the two approaches possibly
sensitive to different issues, like computational
efficiency or the facilities provided for controlling the effect of confounding variables.
Looking at the specific signals detected, the
results would support the relative safety of
iopamidol in comparison to other contrast media, at least when focusing on the 11 AEs tested
(22-25). This product showed only two positive
signals (for acute renal failure and ventricular
fibrillation) when sales data were not included in
the model and no signal at all when the analysis

was run with sales data. lomeprol appears to be
the contrast media with the highest number of
positive signals. This finding emerged when sales
data were employed. lomeprol showed negative
signal with respect to acute renal failure and ventricular fibrillation when sales data were not
considered, but the signal became positive when
adjusted by sales data. N o signal was detected for
gadoteridol and gadobenate dimeglumine when
the analysis was run without sales data. By including sales data, the signal becomes positive
for only the allergic-type reactions like pruritus,
laryngeal edema, and conjunctivitis. This could
be partially due to the lower utilization of gadoteridol and gadobenate dimeglumine in comparison to iopamidol and iomeprol.
Although the inclusion of sales data reinforces
the credibility of signal estimates, a formal validation of the sales data adjustment method in
interpreting the signal results would require ad
hoc epidemiological studies as hypothesis-validating tools. Retrospective methods were ap-

plied to signals detected in large international
databases (ll),but they seem unsuited for our
purpose since with our signals the evaluation of
the validity would call for a validation reference
based on the comparison among contrast media
rather than on the absolute evidence for an adverse event to occur.
In conclusion, as long as the drugs of interest
are comparable in terms of clinical utility, the
signals detected are expected to be useful in
preferring one drug to another. Sales data,
which are always available at the respective drug
manufacturers center for its owned products,
might help prevent signals being biased by mere
differences in product utilization. A future step
will be the conduction of a more complete interproduct quantitative analysis, thus comparing
the safety of Bracco's contrast media with the
safety of all the products that are monitored at
larger and representative pharmacovigilance
databases owned by internationally recognized
organizations.

APPENDIX
To obtain, on a theoretical basis, the relationship between the 1C obtained from the information source
S , and the information source S,, we consider the ideal situation in which for each drug i and AE j there
is perfect knowledge of their joint probability and then study how the availability of different information sources affects the estimation of the association degree for each pair drug-AE ( i , j ) . A detailed description of this investigation scheme, with specific reference to its mathematical technicalities, can be
found in the work of Fagiuoli and Stella (13).
To present the main result of the investigation schema, exploited in this article, the following notations and definitions are introduced. Let di be a binary variable bes, no] associated with the proposition
"Has the patient taken the drug i?" and aj be a binary variable bes, no] associated with the proposition
"Did the patient show the AE j?" Furthermore, let d be a binary variable bes, no] associated with the following proposition: "Has the patient taken any drug?" Let a be a binary variable bes, no] associated with
the following proposition: "Did the patient show any AE?" Therefore, the binary variable d is formally
defined as follows:
= {yes

if

no

3i:d, = yes
ot herwise

where the index i ranges over all possible drugs, while the binary variable a is defined as follows:
a = {yes

no

if

3j:a, = ye5

otherwise

where the index j ranges over all possible AEs.
Now, let P,(dj,aj) be the joint probability for the pair drug-AE (i, j ) in the case when the environment is
fully observed through the information source F, that is. when the state of the pair (di,aj) is observed
for the pair (d,a). Furtherconditionally on the four possible states [O/es,yes),O/es,no),(no,yes),(no,no)]

STATISTICS

more, let Ps,(dj,aj)and Ps,(dj,aj) be the joint probabilities for the pair drug-AE (i, j) when the environment is partially observed, respectively,by means of the information sources s, and s,.
In particular, the information source S, provides information about the pair (di,aj)conditionally on
the following states [(yesyes),(yes,no)]
for the pair (d,a), and therefore it gives information about the pair
(di,aj)in the case when it is known with certainty that the patient has assumed at least one drug. The information source s, provides information about the pair (dj,aj)conditionally on the following state:
[(yesyes)]for the pair (d, a). Therefore, it gives information about the pair (d,,aj) in the case when it is
known with certainty that the patient has assumed at least one drug and has shown at least one AE.
All the possible configurations for the vector (d,aPd,a),depending on the considered information
sources F. S,, and S, are listed together with the induced joint probability for the pair (d,,aj).The information source F is associated with an oracle that fully observes the environment; the information
source S, is associated with data coming from both the AEs database and the drugs sales database, that
is, it includes data where (d =yes. a =yes) or (d =yes, a = no); the information source S , is associated with
data coming from the AEs database only, that is, it includes only patients who have taken at least one
drug and have shown at least one AE (d =yes, a =yes).
The argument developed by Fagiuoli and Stella (l3)allows the true IC to be written as follows:

where

PF(a, I d = n o )
PF(d = no)
PSI(a, I d = yes)
gys2=

('44)

Ps, (a = yes I d,)
PSI(a = yes I d = yes)

('45)

Equation ( A l ) is particularly important; indeed, it expresses the true IC (A2), associated with the information source F, as a sum of the IC (A3), associated with the information source s,, with the two bias
terms (A4) and (A5). The first bias term (A4) represents the bias incurred in the estimation of the true
IC (A2), when using the information source S, instead of F. The second bias term (AS) represents the
bias incurred in the estimation of the IC associated with the information source S,

when using the information source S, instead of S,.
Notice that the bias term 67' sl, incurred when using the information source S, instead of F, depends only on the considered AE j; therefore, if within the F database there is an ordering for a given AE
j related to different drugs i and k (eg, ICF > IC&or, alternatively, IC; < IC&),then the same ordering is
preserved within the S, database. That is, ICgl> IC&alternatively, IC;k ICGI).
The bias term 671+ s2 incurred when using the information source S, instead of S, depends only on
the considered drug i. Therefore, 6:- s1 (A4) can be interpreted as a normalization term that takes into
account the fact that in the F database are present not only AEs caused by drug assumption (d =yes).
but also spontaneous AEs, that is, events not caused by the assumption of any drug (d = no). Further-

more, the term 6?l+Q (AS) is a measure of the relative global dangerousness of drug i with respect to
the dangerousness of a generic drug weighted over the drugs that appear in the F database.
Equation A 1 strongly motivates the joint usage of AEs database and the drugs sales database when
available instead of using only the data coming from the AEs database. Indeed, by evaluating the true IC
lC$ ( A l ) through the lC$jl (A6),and thus by using the information source S,, the introduced bias is lower than the one introduced in the case when the true IC IC; ( A l ) is evaluated through the lC%2 (A3),
that is, when using data coming from the information source S,.
However, even if Eq. A 1 clarifies the mechanism through which successive biases are introduced
when moving from the information source F to the information source S, and then from the information source S , to the information source S,, the 1C associated with each information source will still
have to be estimated through counts data coming from different databases.
Therefore, in the case when the information source S, is considered, the posterior expectation for the
Information Component IC?;.' (6),according to the BCPNN approach, is estimated as follows:

where Cis the total number of AEs (ie, the sum of the number of AEs over all case reports contained in
the AEs database), Csl is the total number of counts for the drugs sales database, cj is the number of
counts for the AE j obtained from the AEs database, cij is the number of case reports related to a specific drug-AE pair (i, j) obtained from the AEs database, c?lis the number of counts for drug i obtained
from the drugs sales database, while a ,apand yij are the BCPNN hyperparameters.
In the case when the information source S, is considered, the posterior expectation for the IC 1C.Y
(A3), according to the BCPNN approach, is estimated as follows:

where C, cp and , cij are defined as in Eq. A7, while ci represents the number of counts related to drug i
obtained from the AEs database.
A formula similar to Eq. A 1 has been developed for the EBlog2 association measure used by the GPS
approach, but its details are omitted here for brevity
