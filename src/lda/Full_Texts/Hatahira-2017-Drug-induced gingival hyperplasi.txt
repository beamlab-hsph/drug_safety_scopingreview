Abstract
Background: Drug-induced gingival hyperplasia (DIGH) causes problems with chewing, aesthetics, and pronunciation,
and leads to the deterioration of the patient’s quality of life (QOL). Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate the
incidence of DIGH using spontaneous reporting system (SRS) databases.
Methods: We analyzed reports of DIGH from SRS databases and calculated the reporting odds ratios (RORs) of suspected
drugs (immunosuppressants, calcium channel blockers, and anticonvulsants). The SRS databases used were the US Food
and Drug Administration (FDA) Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) and the Japanese Adverse Drug Event Report
(JADER) database. With the data, we evaluated the time-to-onset profile and the hazard type using the Weibull shape
parameter (WSP). Furthermore, we used the association rule mining technique to discover undetected relationships such
as possible risk factors.
Results: The FAERS contained 5,821,716 reports. The RORs (95% confidence interval: CI) for cyclosporine, everolimus,
sirolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, amlodipine, nifedipine, carbamazepine, clobazam, levetiracetam, phenobarbital,
phenytoin, primidone, topiramate, and valproic acid, were 39.4 (95% CI: 30.3–51.2), 4.2 (1.7–10.0), 6.6 (2.5–17.7), 13.1
(7.2–23.2), 94.8 (80.0–112.9), 57.9 (35.7–94.0), 15.1 (10.3–22.3), 65.4 (33.8–126.7), 6.5 (3.6–11.8), 19.7 (8.8–44.0), 65.4
(52.4–82.9), 56.5 (21.1–151.7), 2.9 (1.1–7.7), and 17.5 (12.6–24.4), respectively. The JADER database contained 430,587
reports. The median time-to-onset of gingival hyperplasia values for immunosuppressants, calcium channel blockers,
and anticonvulsants use were 71, 262, and 37 days, respectively. Furthermore, the 95% CI of the WSP β for
anticonvulsants was over and excluded 1, which meant that they were wear-out failure type.
Conclusions: Our results suggest that DIGH monitoring of patients administered immunosuppressants, calcium channel
blockers, or anticonvulsants is important. We demonstrated the potential risk of DIGH following the long-term use of
calcium channel blocker over approximately 260 days. Based on the results of the association rule mining approach,
patients with intellectual disability who are administered phenytoin should be monitored carefully. We recommend
that patients who experience symptoms related to DIGH should be closely monitored.

Background
Drug-induced gingival hyperplasia (DIGH) is a periodontal side effects of certain drugs, causing swelling,
bleeding, and problems with chewing, aesthetics, and
pronunciation. In more severe cases, it can cause high
mobility and detachment of the teeth due to alveolar
bone absorption. All of these effects lead to the deterioration of the patient’s quality of life (QOL). More than 20
drugs are associated with DIGH [1], principal among
them are immunosuppressants, calcium channel blockers,
and anticonvulsants [1]. Dongali-Bagtzoglow [1] reported
that >70, 6–15, and 50% of DIGH incidences were
observed with cyclosporine (CsA; an immunosuppressant), nifedipine (a calcium channel blocker), and phenytoin (an anticonvulsant), respectively.
Since DIGH is a rare adverse event, epidemiologic
research is difficult to perform. Spontaneous reporting
systems (SRSs) are useful for the detection of rare adverse events and have been recognized as primary tools
for pharmacovigilance that reflect the realities of clinical
practice. The main aim of regulatory authorities is to
collect and store safety reports for monitoring community health. Several pharmacovigilance indexes including
the reporting odds ratio (ROR), were developed to evaluate drug-associated adverse events determined though
SRS data. The concept of disproportionate analysis of
ROR is common in the conventional analysis of SRSs,
which attempts to quantify the degree of “unexpectedness” of a drug to adverse event association.
Recently, analysis of time-to-onset data has been proposed as a new method to detect signals for adverse
events in SRS. To the best of our knowledge, analyses of
the time-to-onset for DIGH using the Japanese Adverse
Drug Event Report (JADER) database are rare. Association
rule mining has been proposed as an analytical approach
in order to study rare adverse drug events, and is a wellestablished method for discovering undetected relationships such as possible risk factors between variables in
huge databases [2–4]. We examined DIGH using both
analytical methods, and adjusted for the influence of
demography and polypharmacy. This is the first study to
evaluate the association between drugs and DIGH using
ROR, time-to-onset analysis, and association rule mining.
The aims of the study were to obtain new information of
risk comparison on drugs or undetected several clinical
factor combination, and onset profiles of DIGH for
prescription drugs in the real world.

Devices Agency (PMDA), controls the SRS of the JADER
database. Adverse events recorded in the FAERS database from January 2004 to June 2014 were downloaded
from the FDA website (http://www.fda.gov). Relevant
information from the JADER database from April 2004
to November 2016 was downloaded from the PMDA
website (http://www.pmda.go.jp). We constructed a database that integrated each FAERS and JADER dataset using
the FileMaker Pro 13 (FileMaker Inc.). For duplicate
entries, we followed the FDA recommendation (http://
www.fda.gov/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Surveillance/AdverseDrugEffects), and adopted
the most recent case number to identify duplicate patient
reports and excluded them from the analysis.
We analyzed four immunosuppressants (CsA, everolimus, sirolimus, and mycophenolate mofetil), four calcium
channel blockers (amlodipine, benidipine, nicardipine and
nifedipine), and 11 anticonvulsants (carbamazepine, clobazam, diazepam, gabapentin, levetiracetam, phenobarbital,
phenytoin, primidone, topiramate, valproic acid, and zonisamide). For drug definitions, we used both the general
and brand names based on the DrugBank 3.0 and 4.0
(Table 1). Drugs in the FAERS were classified into four
categories: Primary Suspect drug (PS), Secondary Suspect
drug (SS), Concomitant (C), and Interacting (I); according
to their anticipated degree of involvement in adverse
events. The analysis was restricted to reports where drugs
were recorded as PS and SS in the FAERS database. In the
“drug information” table of the JADER database, each
drug was assigned a code according to its association with
adverse drug reactions: “suspected drug,” “concomitant
drug,” or “interacting drug.” The analysis was restricted to
reports where drugs were recorded as “suspected drugs”
in the JADER database.
Definition of DIGH

The adverse event definitions used in FAERS were those
provided by the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) version 17.1. For the extraction of
cases from the FAERS database, we used two preferred
terms (PTs), gingival hyperplasia (PT code: 10018283)
and gingival hypertrophy (PT code: 10018284). The adverse event definitions used in JADER were those provided by MedDRA version 19.0. In the MedDRA 19.0,
the two PTs related to DIGH were combined into “gingival hypertrophy (PT code: 10018284).” Thus, for the
extraction of cases from the JADER database, we used
the PT gingival hypertrophy (PT code: 10018284).

hazard was estimated to be constant over time (random

greater than 1, the hazard was considered to increase
over time (wear-out failure type). If the upper limit of
the 95% CI of β was less than 1, the hazard was considered to decrease over time (initial failure type) [11]. The

reporting odds for all other drugs. We detected the signals when the ROR estimated and lower limits of the
corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) were greater
than 1, and at least 2 cases were required to define the
signal [5, 6].
Time-to-onset analysis

Median, quartile, and Weibull shape parameter (WSP)
tests were used to evaluate the time-to-onset analysis
[7–10]. We analyzed the time the specific adverse event
occurred from when the prescription of specific drugs
commenced by using the Weibull distribution parameter. We excluded reports that did not have complete
adverse event occurrence and prescription start times.
The scale parameter α determined the scale of the distribution function while the shape parameter β determined
the shape of the distribution function. In the analysis of
the SRSs, the shape parameter β of the Weibull distribution was used to indicate the hazard without reference

The association rule mining approach attempts to evaluate frequent items in databases. Given a set of transactions T, an association rule can be expressed as X → Y,
where X and Y are mutually exclusive sets of items
[12–14]. The rule’s statistical significance and strength
are measured as support and confidence. The support
is defined as the percentage of transactions in the
data that contain all items in both the antecedent
(left hand side) and the consequent (right hand side)
of the rule [12–14]. The support indicates how frequently the rule occurs in the transaction and has the
following formula:
Support ¼ PðX∩YÞ ¼ fX∩Yg=fDg
where D is total number of transactions in the database.
The confidence corresponds to the conditional probability P (Y|X). It is important for a rule to have a high confidence because it provides an accurate prediction of the
association of the items in the rule. The formula for calculating confidence is as follows:
Confidence ¼ PðX∩YÞ=PðXÞ
Lift is the probability of X and Y occurring together divided by the multiple of the two individual probabilities
for X and Y; that is,
Lift ¼ P ðX∩YÞ=PðXÞPðYÞ
Since P (Y) appears in the denominator of the lift
equation, the lift can be considered to be the confidence
divided by P (Y). The lift can be evaluated as follows:
lift = 1, > 1, and <1 if X and Y are independent, positively correlated, and negatively correlated, respectively.
We performed these analyses using the apriori function
of the arules library in the arules package R version
3.3.2 software [15].

Results
The FAERS database contained 5,821,716 reports that
were submitted between January 2004 and June 2014.
After deleting the duplicate reports, 4,551,642 reports
were analyzed. The number of case reports and the
RORs are summarized in Table 2. The RORs for cases

17.5 (12.6–24.4), respectively.
The JADER contained 430,587 reports submitted
between April 2004 and November 2016. The lower limits
of the ROR 95% CI for CsA, amlodipine, nicardipine,
nifedipine, carbamazepine, clobazam, diazepam, levetiracetam, phenobarbital, phenytoin, primidone, valproic acid,
and zonisamide as suspected drug were all greater than
one.
Time-to-onset

We evaluated data from the JADER database using timeto-onset analysis. The time-to-onset data and WSP are
summarized in Fig. 1. The medians and quartile ranges
for the onset day of DIGH after treatment with immunosuppressants, calcium channel blockers, and anticonvulsants were 71 (interquartile ranges: 22–120), 262
(76–442), and 37 (37–77) days, respectively. This time-

to-onset profile shows that over 50% of DIGH were
observed after 37–120 days. The WSP β and 95% CI of
immunosuppressants, calcium channel blockers, and
anticonvulsants were 1.41 (0.31–3.82), 1.70 (0.84–2.97),
and 1.79 (1.23–2.44), respectively (Fig. 1). The WSP β
and 95% CI lower limit of anticonvulsants exceeded 1,
which describes a wear-out failure type, indicating a significant association between anticonvulsants and DIGH.
Association rule mining

We analyzed the JADER database using an association
rule mining technique. Association rule mining was
applied to the DIGH data using demographic data
including age (22 items: < 10 y.o., child, adolescent, etc.),
patient history in the all reported cases (8141 items:
intellectual disability, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, etc.),
administered drugs listed in the Table 1 (19 items: cyclosporine, everolimus, silorimus, etc.), and adverse event [1
item: gingival hypertrophy (PT code: 10018284)]. The
apriori algorithm efficiently extracts sets of adverse events
that occur more frequently than the minimum support
threshold (defined as 0.00001 in this study), and generates
sets of adverse events with the minimum confidence
threshold (defined as 0.01 in this study). Furthermore, the
maximum size of mined frequent itemsets (maxlen: a

parameter in the arules package) was restricted to 3. The
result of the mining algorithm was a set of 44 rules (Tables
3 and 4). The support, confidence, and lift for each association rule are summarized in Tables 3 and 4; the association rules in descending order of the support are shown
in Table 3, and in descending order of the lift are shown in
Table 4. Anticonvulsants, especially phenytoin, demonstrated a high support value (Table 3, Fig. 2). The lift
aspect of the association rules strength for anticonvulsants, especially phenytoin, carbamazepine, clobazam, and
diazepam were high. The association rule of {phenytoin,
intellectual disability} → {gingival hypertrophy} with high
scores for lift and support were demonstrated (Table 3 (id
[18]), Table 4 (id [4]), Fig. 2). For this rule, the values for
support, confidence, and lift were 0.000021, 0.07, and
375.08, respectively. The association rule of {clobazam,
diazepam} → {gingival hypertrophy} demonstrated high
scores for lift (Table 4 (id [3]), Fig. 2). The association rule
of {phenytoin, cerebral palsy} → {gingival hypertrophy}
and {carbamazepine, cerebral palsy} → {gingival hypertrophy} also demonstrated high scores for lift (Table 4 (id
[1, 2]), Fig. 2).

Discussion
Our results suggest that adverse-event signals of DIGH
were detected for several drugs in the FAERS and
JADER databases. The risk of DIGH is stated in the
package inserts of amlodipine, phenytoin, and zonisamide in the US, and CsA, mycophenolate mofetil, amlodipine, benidipine, nifedipine, levetiracetam, phenytoin,
topiramate, and valproic acid in Japan, which agrees with
our results. Furthermore, we detected signals of DIGH
for several drugs such as nicardipine, carbamazepine,
clobazam, diazepam, phenobarbital, primidone, and
zonisamide that have no adverse-event warning stated in
their package inserts in Japan. A more detailed analysis
focusing on these drugs should be the subject of future
investigation.
Our study had some limitations that should be noted.
SRSs are subject to numerous biases and confounders.
Since the SRSs did not contain control populations, the
ROR does not provide sufficient evidence on causality
and should be considered exploratory in the context of
signal detection [5–7, 16–21]. The time-to-onset analysis
using the WSP method allowed the detection of potential adverse events without requiring a control population [22, 23]. For this reason, we examined the time-toonset of DIGH using the WSP test.
To the best of our knowledge, no time-to-onset analyses of DIGH have been addressed using SRSs. The aim
of the time-to-onset analysis was to obtain new information and compare the risks and onset profiles of DIGH
for prescription drugs in the real world. The medians of
the times-to-onset values for immunosuppressants and

Page 6 of 11

anticonvulsants were 71 and 37 days. The WSP β of
anticonvulsants was 1.79 (1.23–2.44) and, so, the hazard
was considered to increase over time (Fig. 1). DIGH
induced by anticonvulsants was likely to be wear-out
failure type. According to a report by Seymour et al.
[24], phenytoin-induced gingival hyperplasia can occur
within 3 months of drug use, which agrees with our results. These results also corresponded with those of previous reports. To alleviate DIGH, early countermeasures
must be initiated. The effective treatments for DIGH are
drug substitution or withdrawal, good oral hygiene practices such as plaque control [1], and surgical treatment.
DIGH induced by anticonvulsants is clinically important
because the number of therapies available for epilepsy
has increased. Seizure control is the primary goal of
epilepsy treatment [25] and therefore it is difficult to
withdraw anticonvulsant drugs. Costa et al. [26] have
reported that appropriate plaque control and early
detection of periodontal disease is difficult, and that care
and periodontal disease tend to worsen easily in patients
with refractory epilepsy. The analysis results suggest that
early monitoring of the gingival tissue following the
observation of gingival hyperplasia in patients administered anticonvulsant agents is required to prevent aggravation of the condition.
The median onset of DIGH by calcium channel blockers
was 262 days, which differed from those of anticonvulsants and immunosuppressants. Special attention should
be paid to the possibility of DIGH occurrence with these
drugs, and careful observation is recommended from 2 to
14 months.
The mechanism mediating the pathogenesis of
medication-triggered connective tissue responses in the
gingiva is still poorly understood. Some hypotheses have
suggested the role of factors such as 1) fibroblasts [27–32],
2) inflammatory cytokines [30, 33–36], and 3) matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) synthesis [31]. CsA, nifedipine, and
phenytoin promote the modeling of periodontal fibroblasts
through the synthesis of gingival fibroblasts or inhibition of
the decomposition of gingival fibroblasts [27–31]. Phenytoin may increase the level of translatable collagen mRNA
in human gingival fibroblast [32], while CsA, nifedipine,
and phenytoin enhance the synthesis of collagenous
proteins in vitro [30, 33–36]. In the case of human gingival
fibroblasts simultaneously exposed to nifedipine and
interleukin-1β [33], an enhancement of collagenous protein
synthesis was observed [33]. CsA may cause a decline in
the secretion of MMP-1 and an accumulation of collagenous proteins [31]. The differences in these mechanisms
may have affected the ROR value or time-to-onset profiles
of each drug.
In the association rule mining approach, since the lift
values of two combined items, {phenytoin, intellectual
disability} were high, patients with intellectual disability

Fig. 2 Association rules for gingival hyperplasia (the JADER database from April 2004 to November 2016 (n = 430,587)). The plot represents items
and rules as vertices connected with directed edges. Relation parameters are typically added to the plot as labels on the edges or by varying the
color or width of the arrows indicating the edges

have a potential risk of DIGH following treatment with
anticonvulsants. Therefore, patients with intellectual disabilities should be monitored carefully. The lift values of
two combined items {diazepam, clobazam}, which were
greater than that of one value were also high enough to
suggests a strong association. The support value was
low, and these data suggest that each association was
strong, although the expression rates were low. This information suggests that polypharmacy with anticonvulsants may increase the risk of DIGH. Since Harpaz et al.
addressed the issue of confounding factors when applying the association rule mining approach, our obtained
association rules might be tabulated independently in

the future to evaluate the confounding factors related to
DIGH [3].
Patients who were administered calcium channel
blockers such as nifedipine or amlodipine demonstrated
high drug levels in their gingival crevicular fluid and were
likely to be exposed to high levels of these drugs [37, 38].
DIGH was observed with CsA treatment in 25–30% and
≥70% of adults and pediatric patients, respectively [1]. Coadministration of medications with CsA increased the risk
of CsA-induced gingival hyperplasia [39], although, the relationship between the dosage, duration of therapy, age,
and sex is still not clear. Unfortunately, cases reported in
the SRS database do not always contain sufficient

Hatahira et al. Journal of Pharmaceutical Health Care and Sciences (2017) 3:19

information on patient background, drug dosage, drugdrug interactions and mode of administration to allow
proper evaluation. Considering the causality constraints of
the current analysis, further epidemiological studies are
recommended.

Conclusions
This study was the first to evaluate the incidences of
DIGH using SRSs. Despite the limitations inherent to
SRS, we identified the risk of DIGH induced by anticonvulsants, immunosuppressants, and calcium channel
blockers. We demonstrated the potential risk of DIGH
following the long-term use of calcium channel blocker
for approximately 260 days. The association rule mining
results suggest that patients with intellectual disabilities
administered phenytoin, should be monitored carefully.
We recommend that patients who experience symptoms
related to gingival hyperplasia should be closely monitored and advised to adhere to an appropriate care plan
for oral hygiene. Finally, it is our hope that these data
will update the information available to clinicians and be
potentially useful for improving the management of
DIGH.
