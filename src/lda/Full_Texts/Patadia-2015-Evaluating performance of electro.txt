Abstract Background Electronic reporting and processing
of suspected adverse drug reactions (ADRs) is increasing and
has facilitated automated screening procedures. It is crucial
for healthcare professionals to understand the nature and
proper use of data available in pharmacovigilance practice.

[spontaneous reporting system (SRS) exemplar] databases in
detecting signals using ‘‘positive’’ and ‘‘negative’’ drug-event
reference sets; and (b) evaluate the impact of timing bias on
sensitivity thresholds by comparing all data to data restricted
to the time before a warning/regulatory action. Methods Ten

events with known positive and negative reference sets were
selected. Signals were identified when respective statistics
exceeded defined thresholds. Main outcome measure Performance metrics, including sensitivity, specificity, positive
predictive value and accuracy were calculated. In addition, the
effect of regulatory action on the performance of signal
detection in each data source was evaluated. Results The
sensitivity for detecting signals in EHR data varied depending
on the nature of the adverse events and increased substantially
if the analyses were restricted to the period preceding the first
regulatory action. Across all events, using data from all years,
a sensitivity of 45–73 % was observed for EU-ADR and 77 %
for FAERS. The specificity was high and similar for EU-ADR
(82–96 %) and FAERS (98 %). EU-ADR data showed range
of PPV (78–91 %) and accuracy (78–72 %) and FAERS data
yielded a PPV of 97 % with 88 % accuracy. Conclusion Using
all cumulative data, signal detection in SRS data achieved
higher specificity and sensitivity than EHR data. However,
when data were restricted to time prior to a regulatory action,
performance characteristics changed in a manner consistent
with both the type of data and nature of the ADR. Further
research focusing on prospective validation of is necessary to
learn more about the performance and utility of these databases in modern pharmacovigilance practice.

developing interrogative schema for exploring drug
safety signals in various databases.
Clinicians should consider the timeframe of data
collection in defining the type of ADR data analysis
(retrospective vs. prospective) and when evaluating the
performance (i.e., diagnostic power) of data sources
used for signal detection.
It is advisable to begin defining standard performance
metrics (sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive
value and accuracy) for use with complementary data
sets (e.g., EHR vs. SRS) in order to maximize
significance and optimize benefit to patients.

Introduction
Access to real-world ‘big data’ is becoming easier for
healthcare professionals. What is their utility to clinicians in
pharmacovigilance (PV) practice? What confidence can be
placed in these data as actionable and therefore valuable from
a PV perspective? Answers to these questions require systematic interrogation of available data with corresponding
assessment of performance. A new body of PV work is
emerging, which, over time, will transform information into
knowledge and provide better understanding of pharmaceutical product safety profiles, thereby protecting public health.
Regulatory agencies worldwide demand rigorous evaluation of safety data prior to approval of new prescription medications, but due to inherent limitations of clinical trials, the full
safety profile of a product is not known prior to long-term use in
large populations [1–3]. Therefore, post-marketing data is
collected and monitored to identify emerging safety issues [4–
6]. The process is called signal detection wherein a ‘‘signal’’ is
defined as ‘‘information that arises from one or multiple sources
(including observations and experiments), which suggests a
new potentially causal association, or a new aspect of a known
association, between an intervention and an event or set of
related events, either adverse or beneficial, that is judged to be
of sufficient likelihood to justify verificatory action [7].’’ In
practice and by definition, this process is hypothesis-generating
and entails further evaluation of relevant data [8].
Over the past decade, electronic reporting and processing
of suspected adverse drug reactions (ADRs) has increased and
has facilitated automated screening procedures. Focus has
shifted from individual case assessment to analysis of aggregate data which are compiled into spontaneous reporting
systems (SRS). Computerized data mining techniques are one
way to detect safety signals [9]. Globally, the two most widely
used SRS databases are the United States (US) Food and Drug
Administration’s (FDA) Adverse Event Reporting System
(FAERS) [10, 11], and the World Health Organization’s
(WHO) VigiBaseTM [12, 13]. Despite the clear value of such
aggregate data, SRS data are known to be incomplete, under/

95

over-reported or selectively reported [7, 14, 15]. Moreover,
information on total patient exposure (i.e., ‘‘background’’ or
‘‘denominator’’) is usually inadequate.
To overcome some of these shortcomings, electronic
health records (EHRs) are being explored as a data source
for signal detection [16–18]. Ongoing initiatives include:
US FDA’s Sentinel Initiative [19], the Observational
Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) [20, 21], the
‘‘Pharmacoepidemiological Research on Outcomes of
Therapeutics by a European Consortium’’ (PROTECT)
project, and the ‘‘Exploring and Understanding Adverse
Drug Reactions by integrative mining of clinical records
and biomedical knowledge’’ (EU-ADR) project [22].
FAERS and EU-ADR databases were chosen for this
study as SRS and EHR exemplars, respectively. The use of
FAERS is long-standing (dates to 1969) and well-documented. The relatively new EU-ADR project (2008–2013),
networks several clinical databases located in four countries, and has the goal ‘‘to develop an innovative computerized system to detect adverse drug reactions (ADRs),
supplementing spontaneous reporting systems’’.
Since SRS cases are known to be reported more frequently
by consumers, lawyers, and healthcare professionals following action from a regulatory agency [23], and EHR data
can be affected by risk minimization measures that often
influence prescribing practices (e.g., safety warnings, health
policy interventions), an impact analysis was conducted.

Aim of the study
The specific objectives of this study are to (a) compare
performance of EU-ADR (EHR exemplar) and FAERS
(SRS exemplar) databases in detecting signals using predefined ‘‘positive’’ and ‘‘negative’’ drug-event reference
sets (respectively, ‘‘positive samples/sets’’ and ‘‘negative
samples/sets’’); and (b) evaluate the impact of timing bias
on sensitivity thresholds by comparing all data to data
restricted to the time before a warning/regulatory action.
Ethical approval
Ethical approval is not needed. This study was done using
secondary data sources. No individual patient or healthcare
professional identifying information was used.
Methods
Design
Events warranting priority for PV monitoring were selected
and evaluated for association with all marketed drugs.

Positive and negative reference sets were then constructed
using methodology previously described [24, 25]. Standard
data mining algorithms were used to interrogate the two
databases with thresholds set according to current PV
practice (described below). Performance metrics include
sensitivity, specificity, precision and accuracy, which were
calculated for all results.
Positive reference sets were evaluated for suitability
regarding timing bias. Seven were chosen for the data
restriction analysis. Assuming regulatory action or media
attention impacts reporting or prescribing behavior, statistical threshold sensitivity for both databases was assessed.

Reference sets and impact analysis samples
Ten events were selected from 23 previously ranked by
significance in pharmacovigilance and public health [24].
These events, Acute Liver Injury (ALI); Acute Myocardial
Infarction (AMI); Acute Renal Failure (ARF); Anaphylactic Shock (AS); Bullous Eruption (BE); Cardiac Valve
Fibrosis (CARDFIB); Neutropenia (NEUTROP); Pancytopenia (PANCYTOP); Rhabdomyolysis (RHABD); and
Upper Gastrointestinal Bleeding (UGIB) represent a range
of clinical course and combination of ADRs easily recognized due to known pharmacology (Type A) or relatively
common idiosyncratic reactions (Type B).
For each event, drugs were defined ‘‘positive’’ if they
were known from the literature, product labels, or Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC) to be associated
with the event and drugs not known to be so associated
were defined ‘‘negative.’’ For positives, MEDLINE citations naming the drug-event pair were reviewed. For negatives, there had to be no MEDLINE citations with cooccurrence of the drug-event pair and no explicit mention
of such adverse event in the product label/SPC. Negative
sets were further qualified using VigiBase to exclude
associations flagged as potential signals. Sets were validated by two physicians proficient in clinical medicine,
epidemiology and PV. A third expert arbitrated any differences. Forty-four positive and 50 negative sets were
defined.
The impact of reporting timeframe on threshold sensitivities was conducted by selecting a subset of the positive
samples that (1) had sufficient exposure data in EU-ADR
[24]; and (2) were flagged as signals after the year 2000
(EU-ADR histories date to 1995). FAERS data were
restricted using the date the reports were entered in the
database. Start and end dates varied across each drug-event
association, as they were dependent on time on market and
date of first warning/regulatory action. Seven drug-event
pairs were chosen: AMI/-Valdecoxib, -Rosiglitazone,

123

Int J Clin Pharm (2015) 37:94–104

-Rofecoxib, ALI/Nimesulide, NEUTROP/Valproic Acid,
PANCYTOP/Allopurinol and RHABD/Atorvastatin.
Databases
The EU-ADR network was chosen as the EHR exemplar
and has follow-up data ranging from 1995 to 2010 on over
20 million patients [22]. Drug exposure was estimated
using date of dispensing/prescription and delivery systems/
dosing regimen, according to characteristics of each database. Due to event coding heterogeneity, harmonization
using Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) concepts, related codes and labels corresponding to events of
interest was conducted and database owners constructed
queries for data extraction (‘‘Appendix 1 in Electronic
supplementary material’’). Data were processed locally and
then pooled utilizing JerboaTM (accesses multiple health
care databases without sharing identifiable data). Results
were analyzed and harmonized, if necessary, by a team of
experts (described by Avillach et al. [26]).
FAERS, containing over seven million reports at the
time of this study, was chosen as the SRS exemplar. Events
are coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory
Activities (MedDRA) with narratives excluded from the
public version [27]. MedDRA, including Standardized
MedDRA Queries (SMQs) version 11.1, was reviewed to
identify terms corresponding to UMLS concepts. For
events lacking SMQs, custom groupings of MedDRA terms
were defined per UMLS concept (‘‘Appendix 1 in Electronic supplementary material’’).
Signal generation
For the EU-ADR database, the Longitudinal Gamma
Poisson Shrinker (LGPS), the posterior expectation of the
incidence rate ratio [relative risk (RR)-LGPS] was estimated for each drug-event pair. RR-LGPS C2 (p value
\0.05) defined a signal, except when the ‘‘Longitudinal
Evaluation of Observational Profiles of Adverse events
Related to Drugs’’ (LEOPARD) method identified such as
potentially due to protopathic bias. Given the absence of
validated thresholds in the EHR data, and the relative
novelty of this approach, a second threshold of RR-LGPS
C1.5 (p value \0.05) was included in the analysis [28].
FAERS analyses were conducted on data up to and
including 2Q2010 using Oracle EmpiricaTM Signal (Waltham, MA). The Gamma Poisson Shrinker (GPS) was used
to compute EB05 (Empirical Bayes posterior Gamma
Mixture 5th percentile; estimates lower point in 90 %
confidence interval). A threshold of EB05 C2 (p value
\0.05) was selected based on extensive use and validation
in PV practice [9].

Analysis
Signal detection sensitivity (i.e., true positive rate) was
defined as the ability to detect (i.e., rediscover) positive
reference samples (i.e., ‘‘true positives’’) and specificity as
the absence of a signal for negative reference samples (i.e.,
‘‘true negatives’’). Sensitivity was calculated by dividing
the number of ‘‘rediscovered’’ positives by all positives in
the reference set. Specificity (i.e., true negative rate) was
calculated by dividing the number of negatives not detected
by all negatives in the reference set.
For evaluation of the diagnostic power or efficiency of
the databases under study, precision or positive predictive
value (PPV) and accuracy were also calculated. PPV was
calculated by dividing the number of true positives by the
total number of signals (i.e., true positives and false negatives). Accuracy was calculated by dividing the sum of
true positives and true negatives by the sum of positive and
negative reference samples. All four performance metrics,
described in Fig. 1, were calculated for each drug-event
pair in both databases.
As noted, SRS case reporting often increases after media
attention/regulatory action and EHR data are affected by
changes in prescribing practices. Since this study focused
on retrospective analyses, the effect of these phenomena
was evaluated by comparing data restricted to the years

preceding first warning/regulatory action date with data
from all years. RR-LGPS C2 and EB05 C2 values from
both periods were compared within the respective
databases.

Results
Positive and negative reference sets are listed in Table 1.
The presence (‘‘YES’’) or absence (‘‘No’’) of a signal is
indicated for each drug-event combination. All performance metrics across the ten event categories are reported
in Table 2. In aggregate across all events, the lower
threshold in EU-ADR data increased sensitivity (RR-LGPS
C1.5, 73 % vs. RR-LGPS C2, 45 %) and decreased specificity (RR-LGPS C1.5, 82 %; RR-LGPS C2, 96 %). When
observed individually, RR-LGPS C2.0 failed to detect 4 of
5 positive samples for ALI, AMI, AS and PANCYTOP
(i.e., false negative rate is high); lowering the threshold to
1.5 ‘‘rescued’’ all but AS. The EB05 C2 used for FAERS
data yielded overall sensitivity 77 % and specificity 98 %
(failed to detect 3 of 5 positive samples for both NEUTRO
and AS).
Conversely, specificity using the same parameters was
relatively high across all negative reference events. An EUADR threshold of RR-LGPS C1.5 yielded a relatively high

false positive rate (9 of 50; 1 each of 5 for ALI, BE and
UGIB, and 3 each of 5 for ARF and RHABD). False
positives dropped to 2 of 50 (both for ARF) with threshold
of 2.0; FAERS analysis yielded 1 false positive among the
50 negative reference samples (ARF).
For each of the event groups, positive predictive value
(PPV) and accuracy were also calculated. EU-ADR data
showed RR-LGPS C1.5 to RR-LGPS C2.0 range of PPV
(78 vs. 91 %) and accuracy (78 vs. 72 %), respectively. On
the other hand, FAERS data yielded a PPV of 97 % with
88 % accuracy.
Signal detection results for selected positive samples
comparing data from all years (yellow circles) to data
restricted to the time before a regulatory action date (red
circles) are shown in Fig. 2. In EU-ADR data from all
years, RR-LGPS C2.0 missed four of seven positives (i.e.,
false negatives); RR-LGPS C1.5 missed only one. When
data were restricted to before a regulatory action, six of
seven were detected with RR-LGPS C2, and all seven with
RR-LGPS C1.5. The greatest change was observed in
PANCYTOP/allopurinol sample (from 6.3 to 23.2).
An opposite trend was observed with FAERS data. For
all years, six of seven positives were detected as signals
with relatively high EB05 values. For five of these, with
data restricted to before regulatory action, the EB05 values

were just slightly over the standard threshold of 2. The
exception to this trend was the RHABD/atorvastatin positive sample where EB05 value showed greater than twofold
increase between using all data (11) to using restricted data
(28.4). The one positive sample, NEUTROP/valproic acid
was not reported at all in FAERS data restricted to before a
regulatory action.

Discussion
This is the first study evaluating the signal detection
diagnostic performance of an EHR exemplar (EU-ADR) as
compared with that of an SRS exemplar (FAERS). In
overall results, sensitivity was comparable with respective
thresholds RR-LGPS C1.5 and EB05 C2. However, within
EU-ADR data there was marked improvement of sensitivity with a lower threshold (45 % RR-LGPS C2.0, vs.
73 % RR-LGPS C1.5). Therefore, signal definition may
need to be adapted (i.e., customized) based on prior evidence for strength of association and type of event (i.e.,
Type A reactions with known pharmacology may require a
lower threshold than idiosyncratic Type B events). For
example, rosiglitazone was suspended in the EU due to
increased AMI risk; the strength of this association was

123

102

below 2 in observational studies and meta-analysis of
randomized clinical trials [29, 30]. In this analysis, AMI/
rosiglitazone was a false negative with RR-LGPS C2.0 but
was detected with RR-LGPS C1.5.
The specificity of signal detection was very high and at
similar levels for the EU-ADR threshold RR-LGPS C2
(96 %) and FAERS (98 %). This finding is reassuring as
one critical issue concerning drug safety signal detection
using EHR databases is the false positive rate. Once again,
however, consideration must be given to the type of event
and the data source. Specificity was lower for RR-LGPS
C1.5 (82 %) versus 2.0 (96 %), but stratification with the
lower threshold into Type A and B events showed marked
contrast of 68 versus 95 % specificity, respectively (data
not shown). PPV and accuracy performance metrics
showed similar behaviors. Namely, there are strengths and
weaknesses in both types of data regarding signal detection
performance based on event type and warrants future and
more extensive study.
Another factor that was suspected to be significant is the
timeframe of analysis. The comparison of data from all
years to years before a regulatory action had a notable
impact on sensitivity in both data sources. In EU-ADR
data, RR-LGPS values of all seven samples increased,
when data was restricted to before a regulatory action (see
Fig. 2). The change in RR-LGPS reflects the expected
change in prescribing behavior. Since regulatory actions
are generally aimed at risk minimization, changing prescribing patterns (usually a reduction in prescriptions) and
a corresponding decrease in the RR LGPS values is
expected.
FAERS data exhibited the opposite effect wherein six of
seven samples showed a decrease in EB05 values when
data was restricted to before a regulatory action. FAERS
contains reports for which an a priori association is suspected by the reporter (i.e., causality is assumed). Regulatory action/media attention usually increases reporting so
corresponding EB05 increase is expected. This issue
should be explored further with a larger number of drugadverse event associations.
Also, performance of statistical algorithms was not the
focus of this study. For FAERS, the data mining algorithm
and threshold have extensive use and validation in PV
practice over decades. However, despite the fact that RRLGPS was validated for the EU-ADR project, it is relatively novel. Therefore, two thresholds were included and
results indicate that additional work is needed to develop
optimal parameters.
This study had several limitations. Firstly, the study was
limited to ten events and performance metrics were based
on relatively small reference sets (44 positive and 50
negative). Although the diversity of adverse events and
reference sets were strongly considered at the time of their

123

Int J Clin Pharm (2015) 37:94–104

creation [24], the findings may not necessarily apply to a
broader range of drug-event associations.
Secondly, the negative reference samples were based on
current safety data. Although unlikely, it cannot be ruled
out that some ‘‘negative’’ drug-event associations may
become ‘‘positive’’ in the future. Furthermore, VigiBase
was used in selecting negative samples and FAERS was
used for the analysis. Both FAERS and VigiBase are SRS
and there is overlap of reports. This may have influenced
high specificity observed in the FAERS analysis and should
be considered for future research on performance
assessment.
Thirdly, although FAERS contains non-US reports, most
are from the US; all EU-ADR data are from EU countries.
Thus, differences in medical practice and population
characteristics could have impacted results. However,
results of each were compared against reference sets which
were selected with a global perspective and selections were
not limited to associations observed only in one region.
Since VigiBase has a larger portion of non-US data, it
could have been included in the analysis but was purposefully excluded as it was one of the information sources
used for the selection of negative reference sets. Nevertheless, the unrestricted analysis was conducted with VigiBase (EB05 C2). The sensitivity and specificity were
similar to FAERS results (77 and 100 %, respectively; data
not shown). Therefore, geographical variations in SRS
databases do appear to impact performance results.
Healthcare professionals must understand the utility and
value of EHRs and big data in pharmacovigilance practice.
This retrospective study has shown favorable performance
of EHR data compared with more traditional SRS data used
in signal detection for marketed products. Perhaps the
greatest significance of this study is that a framework has
been established. Future research should focus on prospective validation of these data sources.

Conclusion
This retrospective evaluation against reference sets may
have slightly favored the performance of FAERS and
underestimated that of EU-ADR data as ‘‘diagnostic’’ signal detection tools. However, the value of both was clearly
demonstrated by a time restriction analysis. Signal detection using data from all years, versus data restricted to
before awareness of a regulatory action, lead to opposite,
but expected trends in the statistics used to interrogate
FAERS and EU-ADR data. Significantly, the performances
of EU-ADR and FAERS data were similar and complementary. Additional research focusing on prospective validation of the EU-ADR system (and other EHR data
sources) is needed.
