Abstract
Drug toxicity is a major concern for both regulatory agencies and the pharmaceutical industry. In this context, text-mining methods for the identification of drug side effects
from free text are key for the development of up-to-date knowledge sources on drug adverse reactions. We present a new system for identification of drug side effects from the
literature that combines three approaches: machine learning, rule- and knowledge-based
approaches. This system has been developed to address the Task 3.B of Biocreative V
challenge (BC5) dealing with Chemical-induced Disease (CID) relations. The first two
approaches focus on identifying relations at the sentence-level, while the knowledgebased approach is applied both at sentence and abstract levels. The machine learning
method is based on the BeFree system using two corpora as training data: the annotated
data provided by the CID task organizers and a new CID corpus developed by crowdsourcing. Different combinations of results from the three strategies were selected for
each run of the challenge. In the final evaluation setting, the system achieved the highest
Recall of the challenge (63%). By performing an error analysis, we identified the main
causes of misclassifications and areas for improving of our system, and highlighted the
need of consistent gold standard data sets for advancing the state of the art in text mining of drug side effects.

CID-relations using a crowdsourcing approach to train the
machine learning system. We present the results obtained
on the BC5 development and evaluation sets (BC5D and
BC5E), and the results of the error analysis performed on
the results of our system.

Methods
The task 3.B of Biocreative V (BC5) focuses on CID relations found in Medline abstracts. These relations can be
expressed in a single sentence or span multiple sentences.
We developed a system to identify CID-relations both at
the sentence and the abstract level, combining three strategies: machine learning, pattern-matching and a
knowledge-based approach. The first two approaches are
aimed at identifying relations at the sentence-level, while
the knowledge-based approach is applied at both sentence
and abstract levels. Figure 1 shows a scheme of the system
and the three configurations used for the challenge runs.
The NER systems DNorm (14, 15) and tmChem (16)
were used to identify disease and chemical mentions, respectively, in the documents. In order to homogenize our
results with other works, the NER results of DNorm and
tmChem provided by the BC5 organizers were used for the
evaluation of the BC5E results.
The NER results were post-processed to improve the
identification of relationships for the CID task. During the
development phase, we detected some False Positive (FP)
predictions at the RE level that were originated by errors in
the previous NER step. In the case of diseases, the identification by the NER of the disease that a patient is suffering
and is the therapeutic indication of the drug could later.
Lead to a FP prediction of our system. An example of
this type of sentences is the following:
i. ‘Prolonged left ventricular dysfunction occurs in ‘patients with coronary artery disease’ after both dobutamine and exercise induced myocardial ischaemia’
(PMID: 10677406).
ii. ‘Risk of transient hyperammonemic encephalopathy in
‘cancer patients’ who received continuous infusion of
5-fluorouracil with the complication of dehydration
and infection’ (PMID: 10327032).
In these cases, we applied regular expressions (such as
‘DISEASE patient(s)’) to filter out the diseases that are not
actually SEs of the drug in the context of the sentence.
For the chemicals, we observed that some simple chemicals such as calcium (Ca), carbon (C) and oxygen (O)
were leading to FP predictions at the RE and were therefore removed from the annotations.
In addition, when the chemical and the disease entities
overlapped in the text, we applied a set of simple rules

RE) are still some of the most important challenges for biomedical text mining. The potential value of text mining
approaches focused on detection of drugs and their relation
with disease is evident in areas such as drug safety monitoring or prediction of drug toxicity.
The BC5 challenge designed specific tasks involving the
identification of diseases and chemicals, and the extraction
of Chemical-induced Disease (CID) relations to promote
the development of text mining solutions for the study of
drug side effects (SEs). Previous work on text mining aimed
at identifying drug and their relations with diseases applied
a variety of strategies, including co-occurrence based statistics (1, 2), patterns (3) and machine learning approaches
(4). Xu and Wang (5) applied a pattern-learning approach
to identify drug treatments from MEDLINE with high precision. Gurulingappa et al. used the JSRE system (6), originally developed to identify interactions between proteins,
for the identification of drug SEs from medical case reports, achieving 87% F-score in the ADE corpus. Bravo
et al. (17) developed a system based also in JSRE to identify drug-disease relations, introducing a new kernel using
dependency trees information. This system achieved
79.3% F-score by 10-fold cross-validation in the EU-ADR
corpus. JReX, a system for event extraction originally developed for protein interactions, has also been adapted to
the domain of pharmacogenomics (7). By leveraging on
syntactic and semantic information of the sentence, JReX
achieved 79% F-score in the identification of drug treatment relations. Other authors have proposed approaches
based on previous knowledge of drug adverse reactions as
an alternative to machine learning-based approaches,
which can be difficult to develop due to their need of large
training datasets (8). For instance, Kang et al developed a
method based on the recognition of concepts followed by
the detection of associations using a database on drug SEs
derived from the UMLS (8). In addition to scientific publications, clinical records and public forums are relevant resources to detect drug adverse reactions (9–12).
Remarkably, most of the previous work restricted the
search of drug adverse reactions to relations between a
drug and a disease co-occurring in the same sentence. In
this regard, the BC5 CID task constitutes a new challenge
since the relations are annotated both at the sentence and
at the whole-document level (e.g. span several sentences).
In this article, we present a system to identify CIDrelations for the BC5 task (13) that combines several of the
approaches previously proposed for the identification of
relations between drugs and diseases, namely patterns, machine learning approach and the use of background knowledge. In addition, to showcase the application of
crowdsourcing as a suitable approach to develop training
data for text mining, we have developed a new corpus on

(such as to detect the longest mention or determine if a
mention is inside another mention) for the selection of the
correct entity.
Then, the NER results were processed to extract
co-occurrences at the sentence level. The abstracts were splitted in sentences, and each offset corresponding to a mention
at the abstract-level was converted to sentence-level offset.

Machine learning approach
The machine learning approach is based on the BeFree system (17), a tool to identify relations between biomedical
entities in free text. BeFree is composed of a module for

Biomedical NER and a module for RE based on Support
Vector Machines (SVM). In this work, only the RE module
was used. The RE module uses different morpho-syntactic
features which are extracted for each sentence. The methods
to obtain such features from a text can be classified in two
groups: shallow and deep linguistic parsing. Due to the processing time constraints of the BC5 challenge, only shallow
linguistic features were used (such as part-of-speech, lemma,
and stem). A predictive model for CID-relations at the sentence level was developed using two different corpora: the
annotation data provided by the CID task organizers (training and/or development sets) and a newly developed CID
corpus (Crowd-CID relation corpus).

Annotated data provided by BC5

Crowd-CID relation corpus
A set of 1,990,686 abstracts focused on diseases, treatments and SEs were retrieved from PubMed. Then, 3,000
abstracts were randomly selected for the annotation process. The DNorm and the tmChem NERs were used to
identify disease and chemical mentions and sentences containing at least one co-occurrence between a disease and a
chemical name were selected for annotation by crowd
workers. Overall, a set of 2,756 PubMed abstracts contained a total of 17,198 unique sentences with at least one
chemical or disease annotation. Of these 17,198 sentences,
only 2,953 sentences contained both a chemical and a disease annotation. There were a total of 3,068 unique
chemical-disease identifier pairs that resulted in 5,160
unique sentence-concept-pair triples representing crowd
verification tasks.
Workers on the Crowdflower microtask platform were
presented each sentence containing a putative CID-relation
and asked to judge whether the relation held. A total of 290
workers were provided detailed instructions with multiple
examples and were required to pass a quiz with 70% minimum accuracy before gaining access to the task, where 134
workers (46.2%) passed. In addition, the system removed
results from workers who failed hidden test questions
embedded in the task stream when they dropped below
70% accuracy. Five workers processed each sentence and
were paid $0.02 per sentence completed. The tasks were
completed within 7 h and cost a total of $763.92.
For the 5160 verification tasks, the distribution of the
crowd response was overwhelmingly that there was no relation between the presented chemical and disease. Only
13.5% of the tasks received three or more votes as being
true CID-relations, while 64.0% of the tasks received full

agreement between workers for being false CID-relations.
Although the percentage of CID-relations was low, these
figures are similar to what would be expected based on the
pure co-occurrence model, especially considering that only
sentence-bound relations were curated for BeFree.
Worker judgments were aggregated based on answer
choice, resulting in the number of workers who said a relation was true, using majority rules. We set a threshold of
three or more votes for answer choice to select the final
corpus, which resulted in 698 true and 4,462 false CID
relations.
For training the BeFree system, the corpus was balanced
by selecting at random a subset of false examples, obtaining a total of 1,628 examples from 1,251 sentences (698
true and 930 false examples).
The BeFree model trained with this subset of crowdCID relation corpus achieved a performance of 82.03,
73.39 and 76.82% of Precision, Recall and F-score, respectively, by 10-fold cross-validation. The CID-crowd relation corpus is available at https://zenodo.org/record/
29887?ln¼en#.VsL3yDLWR_V.

Rule-based approach
The rule-based approach is the most straightforward technique to identify relations between two entities at the sentence level. Xu and Wang 2014 reported the most frequent
patterns used to express chemical-SE relations in FDA drug
labels (3). We used a subset of these patterns (such as
‘CHEMICAL-induced SE’, ‘CHEMICAL-associated SE’,
‘SE caused by CHEMICAL’ and ‘SE during CHEMICAL’)
to identify CID-relations at the single sentence level.

Expert knowledge-based approach
We checked if a CID-relation identified in the text (at the
sentence or abstract level) was already known as a drug
SE, or as the therapeutic indication of the drug. In particular, we removed those CID-relations identified at the abstract level that were annotated as the therapeutic
indication in our knowledge base. This knowledge base
was developed by integrating information from different
resources (CTD (19), SIDER2 (20) and MEDI (21) databases) that contain information on drug therapeutic indications and SEs. JoChem (22) and PubChem (23) were used
to map the chemical entities to MeSH identifiers. The
UMLS Metathesurus MRCONSO table was used to map
between MeSH and UMLS identifiers for the diseases. The
database contains 28,455 chemical-disease associations
labeled as therapeutic, and 55,960 labelled as SEs.
Associations labelled both as therapeutic and SEs were not
included in the database.

All the abstracts from the training and development (BC5T
and BC5D) sets (18) were processed by the DNorm and
tmChem NERs to identify disease and chemical entities.
Then, the sentences including at least one co-occurrence
between a disease and a chemical were selected as possible
CID-relations for training the BeFree RE module. If the
identifiers of a specific co-occurrence were reported as true
by the gold standard (GS), the sentence and the CID pair
was saved as a true CID-relation, otherwise it was considered a false CID-relation. According to this procedure,
3,632 true and 6,122 false CID-relations were found in
3,728 sentences. The BeFree model trained on this set
achieved a performance of 59.86, 68.82 and 63.96% of
precision, recall and F-score, respectively, by 10-fold crossvalidation.

Figure 1 shows a schema of our combined system to detect
CID-relations for the BC5 task. The CID-relations stated
at the sentence level (that could also be stated at the abstract level) were processed by the CID-patterns approach
and BeFree, while the CID-relations that were found at the
abstract level were processed by the knowledge-based approach to identify known side-effect relations (SE). Note
that the set of CID-relations processed by the knowledgebased approach include CID-relations that could be stated
at both abstract and sentence-level. The BeFree model was
trained with the crowd-CID relation corpus and the BC5T
set when assessing the system performance on the development set. For the challenge evaluation set, the model was
trained on the crowd-CID relation corpus and the BC5T
and BC5D sets. Finally, after obtaining the union of the results of each approach, we removed those relations that
are known as therapeutic indication of the drug as a final
filtering step (represented in the last box of Figure 1 as
‘treatment_filtering(Final_Results)’).

70% of CID-relations were annotated as true associations.
Table 1 shows the results obtained with our system.
Applying a simple co-occurrence approach on the chemical
and disease mentions identified by the provided BC5 NER
systems on this GS results in 16.43% Precision and
76.45% Recall, setting the upper boundary for Recall in
the development set (16.46% Precision and 81.71% Recall
were obtained on the subset of 50 abstracts from BC5D).
By applying the expert knowledge (EK)-based approach
to identify CID-relations at the abstract-level, we achieved
60.8, 42.37 and 50.00% Recall, Precision and an F-score,
respectively. The low Precision obtained with a
knowledge-based approach is surprising. Without performing an error analysis on the development data we can
speculate that issues related with identifier mapping between the knowledge base and the evaluation data, or different annotation criteria between the knowledge bases
and the evaluation set might result in a large number of FP.
The low Recall can be explained by (i) not considering associations at sentence-level, (ii) limitations of the knowledge sources considered and (iii) issues related with
identifier mapping.
On the other hand, the approaches aimed at detecting
CID-relations at the sentence-level were also individually
evaluated. The rule-based approach resulted in a high precision and low recall (71.43 and 12.20%, respectively),
while the BeFree system achieved 39.20, 53.66 and 45.62
of precision, recall and F-score, respectively (38.61% of recall, 47.56% of precision and 45.62% of F-score were the
results obtained only using the BC5T set).
The different approaches were combined in 3 different
ways for the challenge (Fig. 1). For the Run no. 1, the CID
pattern approach was applied first, followed by BeFree and
finally the knowledge-based approach. If a CID was found

by the pattern based approach, the other two methods
were not applied and the results reported were the ones resulting from pattern matching. In contrast, the three
approaches were applied simultaneously in Run nos. 2 and
3, and the results were the union of the results of each of
them. The difference between these two runs is that in Run
no. 3 the CID pattern approach is only applied to the title
of the abstract and not to the remaining text. In the three
runs, the final set of results was filtered by removing those
CID-relations that were annotated as therapeutic in our
knowledge base.
Finally, the different approaches and the combination
between them were also evaluated against the full BC5E
set. Table 2 shows the different results obtained in each experiment on the BC5E set. Although the Precision and
Recall values are lower than on the BC5D set, they followed the same behavior.
In contrast to the performance on BC5D, the best performance obtained on the BC5E set was with Run no. 2,
achieving 63.04% Precision, 38.23% Recall and 47.59%
F-score. When compared with the performance on 50
documents of the BC5D, the performance on the BC5E set
is significantly decreased. However, the results are not that
different to the ones obtained on the 500 documents of the
BC5D. Based on these results and those from comparisons
between the 50 and 500 document set for Run nos. 2 and
3, we can suggest that the differences in performance arise
from distinct sub-sets within the data that have different
characteristics. Another factor explaining the differences
would be the different data used to train the BeFree model
in these two settings (BC5D and BC5E sets).

Analysis of performance against the GS
When the BC5E set was provided by the BC5 organizers,
several analysis were carried out comparing the GS annotations and the results of our system, in order to identify the
causes of erroneous predictions produced by our system.

Figure 2. Number of Gold Standard CID associations stated in a single
sentence (Sentence-level) or spanning several sentences (Abstractlevel).

The GD is composed of 1,066 CID-relations, where 30%
are only stated spanning several sentences (abstract level),
2% are stated only at the sentence-level, and 68% are
observed both at the abstract and the sentence levels
(Figure 2). The different approaches that are the basis of
our system were separately evaluated against the GS at the
sentence, abstract and both levels.
Since the EK approach aims at identifying CID-relations
at the abstract-level, we used the subset of CID-relations
stated at the abstract level (1,046) to analyse in detail its
performance. Figure 3 shows the results obtained when
applying a co-occurrence based approach and filtering the
found drug-disease co-occurrences with information from
a knowledge base. By simply considering all the possible
co-occurrences of a drug and a disease at the abstract level,
we correctly identify 765 CID-relations (TP, leading to a

Recall of 73%) and miss 281 CID-relations (FN). The FNs
are mainly due to errors in the NER. This approach produces, as expected, a large fraction of FP CID-relations
(3,923). The number of FP can be decreased by 18% by
considering background knowledge, in particular by
removing those associations annotated as the therapeutic
indication of the drug in our database. This filtering step
also reduces the number of TP detected. This may due to
the fact that some adverse events are related to the therapeutic effect of the drug. An example of these are the drugs
prescribed to lower blood pressure, that can produce fainting as undesired effect when taken at high doses (24).
When applying an additional filtering step, such as selecting only those chemical-disease pairs annotated as SE
associations in the knowledge base, we observe an important decrease of FP (76%), and also an increase in FNs. In
both cases in which we apply background knowledge, the
reduction of FP and TP results was due to the reduction of
the overall number of results. Many TP results were discarded because their CID-relations were not found in the
knowledge base, which can be explained by its incompleteness, or otherwise issues related with identifier mapping
between the database and the evaluation data. In addition,
not all FPs were removed, because the EK approach took
all possible chemical–disease pairs detected in each abstract without considering the topic of the abstract or if the
chemical–disease pairs were semantically linked. The

presence of FP even after filtering with known CIDrelations can be explained by: i) different criteria in the annotation of CID-relations for the BC5 and drug SE in the
databases SIDER and CTD; ii) errors in the SE databases
(in fact SIDER is developed using a text mining approach);
iii) again, issues of identifier mappings for both drugs and
diseases (for instance, UMLS identifiers are mainly used in
these databases to describe a disease). We foresee that a
high quality database on drug therapeutic indications and
drug SEs could improve the results obtained with this kind
of approach.
We performed a more detailed analysis on the results
obtained by the BeFree system and the CID Pattern
approaches. We focused on the CID-relations stated at the
sentence-level from the GS for this analysis. The results are
shown in Figure 4. As expected, the identifications performed by the BeFree system improved the simple cooccurrence selection. Although the TPs results decreased
slightly (consequently, decreasing the Recall), about 55%
of the FPs were removed, increasing significantly the
Precision. A similar trend was observed when the results
from BeFree were filtered by using the EK approach
(removing CID-relations annotated as therapeutic indications in the knowledge base). Although 40% of FPs were
removed, the TPs were reduced in 20%. On the other
hand, the CID Patterns approach achieved a high

‘However, additional important untoward effects of heparin therapy include heparin-induced thrombocytopenia,
heparin-associated osteoporosis, eosinophilia, skin reactions, allergic reactions other than thrombocytopenia, alopecia, transaminasemia, hyperkalemia, hypoaldosteronism, and priapism’.
The ‘skin reactions’ mention was not detected causing a FN. The remaining CID-relations were properly detected.
As additional comment, ‘transaminasemia’ is a SE not included in the GS (also, it is not detected by DNorm), in our
opinion Heparin-Transaminasemia should be annotated as a CID-relation.

as bradycardia, in people with HIV’.
In this case, tmChem did not detect ‘Viracept’ as a drug causing a FN.

‘The effect of pupil dilation with tropicamide on vision and driving simulator performance’.
In this example, ‘pupil dilation’ was normalized with MeSH:D002311, but in the GS the mentions was annotated
with MeSH:D015878, causing a FP and FN, because BeFree predicted the entities as a CID-relation.
Example no. 5 (PMID:10933650)
‘Histopathological examination of the kidney showed tubular necrosis in D-AmB-treated rats but no change in NS718-treated rats’.
The entity ‘D-Amb’ was not normalized by the tmChem (in the GS was identified as MeSH:C059765), resulting in a
FN.

BeFree identification

The BeFree system identified incorrectly a CID-Relation.
Example no. 6 (PMID:11385188)
‘Prevalence of heart disease in asymptomatic chronic cocaine users’.
‘We conclude that coronary artery or myocardial disease is common (38%) in young asymptomatic chronic cocaine
users’.
In the first sentence, the BeFree system identified the ‘Cocaine’- ‘Heart Disease’ association as a true CID-relation,
causing a FP. Although in the second sentence, the BeFree system reported as a false CID-relation the ‘CocaineMyocardial Disease’ association, causing a FN.
Example no. 7 (PMID:10462057)
‘No necrosis was observed in cells treated with NCQ436 but NCQ344 had a biphasic effect in both cell types,
inducing apoptosis at lower concentrations and necrosis at higher concentrations’.
‘We propose that remoxipride and benzene may induce aplastic anemia via production of similar reactive metabolites and that the ability of NCQ436 and NCQ344 to induce apoptosis in HBMP cells may contribute to the mechanism underlying acquired aplastic anemia that has been associated with remoxipride’.
In the first sentence, the BeFree system improperly reported the ‘NCQ436- Necrosis’ association as a true CID-relation, causing a FP. Also, in the second sentence, the BeFree system identified as a true CID-relation the ‘NCQ436/
NCQ344-Aplastic Anemia’, causing two FPs.
Example no. 8 (PMID:11439380)
‘Thalidomide neuropathy in patients treated for metastatic prostate cancer’.
In this example, the BeFree system identified ‘Thalidomide-Prostate Cancer’ as a CID-relation, including a FP.

Example no. 1 (PMID:10764869)
‘Tacrolimus and other immunosuppressive agents may be associated with optic nerve toxicity’. ‘The GS relation is
Tacrolimus- optic nerve toxicity. DNorm system did not properly detect ‘optic nerve toxicity’, but only ‘toxicity’.
BeFree predicted the relation Tacrolimus-Toxicity as a CID-relation causing a FP and FN.

Type of Error

Description and examples

Composite mention

When a single span refers to more than one concept.
Example no. 10 (PMID:10401555)
‘Nociceptin/orphanin FQ and nocistatin on learning and memory impairment induced by scopolamine in mice’.In
this sentence, BeFree only predicted one association as CID-relation, the ‘Memory Impairment’-‘Scopolamine’ association. ‘Learning Impairment’ was not detected, because our workflow does not detect composite mentions, causing a FN.

Abstract-level

The CID-relation only happening at the abstract-level, so BeFree cannot identify it.
Example no. 11 (PMID:11229942)
‘Ventricular arrhythmias were primarily observed in the CþE group, in which four of eight dogs experienced ventricular tachycardia’.
‘Ventricular tachycardia’ was annotated as CID-relation with ‘Ethanol’ and ‘Cocaine’.

Discrepancy

This type of error is perhaps the most controversial, where we have indicated the possible inconsistencies between
the GS and our criteria for CID-relations.
Example no. 12 (PMID:10401555)
‘On the other hand, nocistatin is recently isolated from the same precursor as nociceptin and blocks nociceptininduced allodynia and hyperalgesia’.
The BeFree system predicted ‘Nociceptin-Allodynia’ and ‘Nociceptin-Hyperalgesia’ as two CID-relations not
included in the GS.
Example no. 13 (PMID:10726030)
‘Bleeding is the primary untoward effect of heparin’.
‘Major bleeding is of primary concern in patients receiving heparin therapy’.
The BeFree system predicted ‘Bledding/Major bledding’-‘Heparine’ as a true CID-relation not included in the GS.
Example no. 14 (PMID:11425091)
The incidence of subependymal cysts in infants exposed to cocaine prenatally was 44% (8 of 18) compared with
8% (8 of 99) in the unexposed group (P < 0.01).
The GS annotated ‘subependymal’ and ‘cysts’ as two different diseases. Dnorm detected ‘subependymal cysts’ as an
unique disease and the BeFree system predicted as CID-relation the association with ‘cocaine’, causing two FN and
one FP.
Example no. 15 (PMID:10713017)
‘The use of appetite suppressants in Europe has been associated with the development of primary pulmonary hypertension (PPH)’.
The BeFree sytems reported the ‘appetite suppressants’-‘PPH’ as a CID-relation, but it was not annotated in the GS.

We show in bold the entities detected by the NER, and underlined the entities that were not detected.

Precision, but the major problem of this approach is the
high number of undetected CID-relations, achieving a very
low Recall. It is interesting to note that, most CIDrelations that follow a simple pattern can already identified
in the title of the abstract (169/184, 91%).

We then performed a detailed error analysis of the FP
and FN results produced by BeFree system on a subset of
abstracts (30 abstracts reporting FP and 30 reporting FN
results). We identified 6 types of errors in our analysis.
Table 3 shows a brief description and some examples for

Example no. 9 (PMID:10327032)
‘Risk of transient hyperammonemic encephalopathy in cancer patients who received continuous infusion of 5-fluorouracil with the complication of dehydration and infection’.
In this example, the BeFree system identified ‘5-Fluorouracil-Dehydration’ as a CID-relation, including a FP. As
additional comment, the GS annotated ‘encephalopathy’ as a diseases, but under our criteria, the annotated disease
mention should be ‘transient hyperammonemic encephalopathy’ or ‘hyperammonemic encephalopathy’.

each type of error, and Figure 5 summarizes each error
type in the FP and FN sets.
As shown in Figure 5, most of the errors reported by the
BeFree system were not related to the system itself. In the
case of FP, most of the errors are due to discrepancies
(51%), followed by BeFree identification errors. On the
other side, NER errors, including entity detection and normalization, together with associations spanning several
sentences were the main reasons of the reported FNs. 8%
of FP were explained by BeFree identification errors. By inspecting the examples that caused erroneous identification
by BeFree, we can identify the main problems of the
method as: i) incorrect handling of negations, ii) long and
complicated sentences with several potentially related entities, iii) incorrect distinction between therapeutic indication of the drug and SEs.

Conclusion and future work
In this paper we have presented a new system to detect
CID-relations leveraging on machine learning, rule-based
approaches and background knowledge. We showed that
the combination of these different approaches addresses an
ambitious challenge as the BC5, achieving competitive results. Specifically, our system achieved the highest Recall
in the BC5 challenge, with values of 79 and 63% on
the BC5D and BC5E, respectively, approaching the Recall
upper limit of each of them (81 and 72% on the BC5D and
BC5E, respectively).
Availability of high quality corpora is a pre-requisite for
supervised machine learning systems and generally requires
considerable efforts to build them (25). We have presented
a new corpus developed by a crowdsourcing approach.
The BeFree system trained on the Crowd-CID corpus achieved high performance in the detection of

CID-relations (82.03, 73.39 and 76.82% of Precision,
Recall and F-score, respectively, evaluated by 10-fold
cross-validation). These results suggest that crowdsourcing
is a good alternative to develop a corpus on CID-relations
in a fast and cheap way, which can be used to train a machine learning system (BeFree system) for the identification
of CID-relations.
Regarding the performance of our system, the low
Precision obtained could be explained by our approach to
detect relations at the abstract level, which considers all
possible co-occurrences and relies on background knowledge to remove FPs. The error analysis performed on the
BeFree results allowed the identification of some of the
weak points of the system, such as incorrect handling of
negations, poor performance on long and complicated sentences with several potentially related entities, and incorrect distinction between therapeutic indication of the drug
and SEs.
Future work includes the evaluation of syntactic dependency features in BeFree to improve the identification
of CID-relations. In addition, methods for the identification of relations spanning several sentences such as anaphora resolution and the correct detection of composite
mentions could be used to improve significantly the overall
results. Finally, training the system to distinguish between
therapeutic use and drug SEs could improve the results.
