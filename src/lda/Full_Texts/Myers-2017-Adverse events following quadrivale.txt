Abstract
Background—Limited data are available describing the post-licensure safety of meningococcal
vaccines, including Menveo®. We reviewed reports of adverse events (AEs) to the Vaccine
Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) to assess safety in all age groups.

Author Manuscript

Methods—VAERS is a national spontaneous vaccine safety surveillance system co-administered
by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the US Food and Drug Administration. We
searched the VAERS database for US reports of adverse events in persons who received Menveo
from 1 January 2010 through 31 December 2015. We clinically reviewed reports and available
medical records for serious AEs, selected pre-specified outcomes, and vaccination during
pregnancy. We used empirical Bayesian data mining to identify AEs that were disproportionately
reported after receipt of Menveo.

Author Manuscript

Results—During the study period, VAERS received 2614 US reports after receipt of Menveo. Of
these, 67 were classified as serious, including 1 report of death. Adolescents (aged 11–18 years)
accounted for 74% of reports. Most of the reported AEs were non-serious and described AEs
consistent with data from pre-licensure studies. Anaphylaxis and syncope were the two most
common events in the serious reports. We did not identify any new safety concerns after review of
AEs that exceeded the data mining threshold, although we did observe disproportionate reporting
for terms that were not associated with an adverse event (e.g., “incorrect drug dosage form
administered”, “wrong technique in drug usage process”). Although reports were limited, we did
not find any evidence for concern regarding the use of Menveo during pregnancy.

INTRODUCTION

Author Manuscript

To protect against invasive meningococcal disease caused by Neisseria meningitidis groups
A, C, W-135, and Y, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) currently
recommends that adolescents receive quadrivalent meningococcal conjugate vaccine
(MCV4) at 11–12 years followed by a booster dose at 16 years and that persons at increased
risk receive a dose series and recommended vaccine product depending upon age and
condition [1]. Coverage in the adolescent population is nearing 80% for at least one dose [2],
indicating that a substantial proportion of this population is electing to receive MCV4
vaccine, of which two brands are currently available in the United States (US). The most
recently licensed MCV4 vaccine, Menveo®, was approved in 2010 for use among persons
aged 11–55 years [3] with subsequent approvals for use in children and infants as young as 2
months [4–5].

Author Manuscript

Pre-licensure studies of Menveo found adverse events (AEs) that were mainly mild and
quickly resolved. In infants and children between 2 and 23 months of age, the most
frequently reported AEs were tenderness, erythema, induration, irritability, and sleepiness
[6–9]. In children aged 2–10 years, the most frequently reported AEs were injection site
pain, erythema, irritability, induration and sleepiness [9–11]. The most frequently reported
AEs from adolescents and adults were injection site pain, headache, erythema and myalgia
[9,12]. Reports of post-licensure data in the US are limited. A recent review of reports to
VAERS following improperly prepared doses of Menveo found AEs similar to those
reported in preclinical studies [13]. Although the Menveo label includes events that have
been reported voluntarily since licensure, frequency of occurrence and causal relationships
have not been determined [9]. To provide additional information on post-licensure safety, we
reviewed reports to the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS) for subjects of
any age receiving Menveo during January 1, 2010 through December 31, 2015.

METHODS
Author Manuscript

VAERS
We utilized data reported to a spontaneous reporting system – the Vaccine Adverse Event
Reporting System (VAERS), co-administered by the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC) and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) – to summarize US
reports following immunization with Menveo. Health care providers, vaccine recipients,
vaccine manufacturers and others submit reports to VAERS, including data on demographic
information about the recipients, vaccine(s) and date received, adverse event(s) experienced,

and medical history. Once a report is received, trained personnel apply the Medical
Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) coding to reported signs and symptoms,
assigning 1 or more preferred terms (PTs) to each report [14]. Reports do not always include
an adverse event (e.g., medication errors). Reports are classified as serious or non-serious,
using the definition for serious based on the Code of Federal Regulations, 21CFR800.60.
This definition specifies classification of an adverse event if it results “death, a lifethreatening adverse experience, inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing
hospitalization, a persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or a congenital/birth defect”;
additionally, the definition specifies that important medical events that do not meet the above
definition may also be classified as serious if they “may jeopardize the patient or subject and
may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this
definition” [15]. VAERS personnel routinely request and review medical records for serious
reports submitted by the public. Vaccine manufacturers are responsible for requesting and
reviewing medical records for reports as described in 21CFR800.60 [14, 15]. VAERS
personnel do not perform causality assessments regarding the relationship between a
particular vaccine and a temporally-associated adverse event.

Author Manuscript

We included all domestic reports to VAERS for subjects of any age vaccinated with Menveo
through December 31, 2015 and received by March 31, 2016. Descriptive statistics were
calculated, including mean and median age of vaccinated individuals, onset interval from
date of vaccination to first symptom(s), and most commonly reported PTs. SAS (version 9.3,
SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC, USA) was used for the data analysis.
Clinical Review

Author Manuscript

We reviewed the medical records available for the majority of serious AE reports to VAERS
after vaccination with Menveo (for two of the public reports only the initial report form was
filed) or in summarized form for all manufacturer’s reports. For each report, we determined
the primary event (and corresponding MedDRA term) that prompted the report and its
respective MedDRA System Organ Class (SOC).

Author Manuscript

In addition, we prespecified conditions for clinical review based on previous studies of
meningococcal and other adolescent vaccines and on clinical judgement. These prespecified
conditions were anaphylaxis, facial nerve palsy (including Bell’s palsy), Guillain-Barré
syndrome (GBS) and vaccine administered during pregnancy. For each report of a
prespecified condition, we reviewed VAERS reports and medical records. Reports of
anaphylaxis, facial nerve palsy and GBS were classified using Brighton Collaboration case
definitions when possible [16–18]. For reports of vaccination during pregnancy, we reviewed
available information to determine maternal trimester of vaccination and whether any pre- or
post-natal adverse event was reported.
Data Mining
We used empirical Bayesian (EB) data mining methods to identify MedDRA PTs that were
reported at least twice as frequently as expected (i.e., lower bound of the 90% CI
surrounding the EB geometric mean [EB05] >2) after adjusting for sex and year received

[19,20]. Reports for PTs exceeding this predetermined limit and not described in the
package insert were considered for further clinical review.
Because VAERS is a routine surveillance program that does not meet the definition of
research, it is not subject to institutional review board and informed consent requirements.

RESULTS

Author Manuscript

VAERS received a total of 2614 U.S. reports following vaccination with Menveo from
January 1, 2010 through December 31, 2015. In 1380 (53%) of these reports, other vaccines
were given concomitantly with Menveo. The most commonly co-administered vaccines
varied depending upon age including pneumococcal (9 [27%]) and measles, mumps and
rubella (8 [24%]) in children less than 2 years of age, tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis
(Tdap) in children aged 2–10 years (32 [41%]), Tdap (776 [40%]) and human
papillomavirus (608 [31%]) in adolescents (aged 11–18 years), and Tdap in adults (>18 yrs,
43 [11%]). Median age of all vaccinees was 12 years (range 0–89 years) and the median
onset interval was 0 days (range 0–734 days), with day 0 set as the day of vaccination.
Reports were nearly equally distributed between males and females (47% each), with the
remainder missing information on sex. Dose number was recorded for 57% of the reports
and ranged from Dose 1 to Dose 7, suggesting a lack of reliability for reported dose.

Author Manuscript

Most reports (n=1932, 74%) were in the adolescent population, including 1 death and 45
serious, non-death reports (Table 1). Among 2–23 month olds, a total of 33 reports were
received, including 4 serious, non-death reports. Among 2–10 year olds, a total of 79 reports
were received, including 4 serious, non-death reports. In adults, 379 reports were received
(12 serious, non-death). Of the reports for which age was missing (n=191), one was a
serious, non-death report. The most frequent PTs (those reported in greater than 5% of the
reports after vaccination with Menveo) are shown in Table 2. The most frequently reported
AEs were related to local reactions (erythema, injection site swelling, injection site warmth,
and injection site pain), dizziness, pyrexia (fever), headache, or syncope.
Serious Reports

Author Manuscript

The SOCs and PTs determined after individual review of the 67 serious reports are shown in
Table 3. Of these, 19 were received from the manufacturer, and the remainder from the
public. In 42 (63%) of these reports, Menveo was administered concomitantly with one or
more other vaccines. The most common presenting SOC was nervous system disorders (16
reports), including diagnoses or presentations of GBS and seizures (4 each). The next most
common presenting SOC was immune system disorders (10 reports), including anaphylaxis
(7) and non-anaphylactic allergic reactions (2). Five cases of syncope were reported,
contributing to a total of 7 reports in the cardiac disorders class. Tradename and
manufacturer could not be confirmed for one report.
Anaphylaxis
We identified 9 reports of possible anaphylaxis. Three reports met the definition for
Brighton level 1, one report met the definition for Brighton level 2, and three reports did not
meet Brighton criteria but were physician-diagnosed anaphylaxis (one of which did not

include tradename or manufacturer); all of these reports were classified as serious and all
included epinephrine administration in the descriptions of treatment. Two non-serious
reports lacked sufficient information to classify according to the Brighton criteria.
Five cases reported symptom onset within 30 minutes of vaccination, while two (one
Brighton level 1 and one Brighton level 2) experienced onset of symptoms 24 hours or more
after vaccination. For the remainder of cases, timing was not precisely specified. Median
onset interval of symptoms was 0 days (range 0–1 days). In one Brighton level 1 case, the
patient had experienced a similar response immediately following receipt of an unknown
vaccine 6 years earlier. Eight of the 9 reports described concomitant administration of other
vaccines.
Facial Nerve Palsy

Author Manuscript

We identified 9 reports of possible idiopathic facial nerve palsy. Three reports were excluded
based on coincident diagnosis of an underlying conditions (thyroid tumor, polyneuritis) or
infection associated with facial palsy (otitis media). One report of idiopathic facial nerve
palsy met the definition for Brighton level 1, one report met the definition for Brighton level
2, and two reports met the definition for Brighton level 3. Two reports lacked sufficient
information to classify according to Brighton criteria. Median onset interval of symptoms
was 1 day (range 1–21 days). None of the reports of idiopathic facial nerve palsy were
classified as serious.
Guillain Barré Syndrome (GBS)

Author Manuscript

We identified 6 reports of possible GBS. One report met the definition for Brighton level 1,
and three reports met the definition for Brighton level 2; all were classified as serious. After
review of medical records, the remaining two reports were determined not to be cases of
GBS (one was determined to be undergoing repeated treatment for chronic inflammatory
demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) and the other had a diagnosis of migraine with
orthostatic hypotension dysautonomic syndrome). Three of the four classified reports were
documented as fully recovered at 1 year, while the fourth reported unresolved symptoms of
neuropathy in both feet. The median onset interval of symptoms was 11 days (range 1–55
days).

Author Manuscript

Viral illness prior to onset of symptoms was noted for two of the reports. In one case,
records indicated that the patient experienced severe gastroenteritis followed by lower
extremity weakness in the weeks immediately before vaccination, although symptoms had
improved before receiving Menveo. In three of the four reports, the patients had received
Menveo alone; the fourth also received trivalent influenza vaccine.
Vaccination in Pregnancy
We identified 14 reports of vaccination with Menveo during pregnancy, and we were able to
determine trimester of vaccination in 12 of these reports (10 were in the first trimester, 1 was
in the second trimester and 1 was in the third trimester). In 11 of these reports, it was noted
that the vaccination was inadvertent or that the pregnancy test occurred after the vaccination.
Three reports did not include verification of tradename or manufacturer.

In the majority of the pregnancy reports (13/14), no AEs were reported. There was one
report of fever and muscle soreness following vaccination. The majority of reports (11/14)
had no information on birth outcomes due to loss to follow-up. Three reports included
limited information on birth outcome: one noted that the mother and infant were “fine”, one
described normal ultrasounds throughout pregnancy followed by an uncomplicated vaginal
delivery, and one described a normal delivery at term with no maternal complications and
normal APGAR scoring for the infant.
We also identified one report of accidental exposure to Menveo during pregnancy due to a
syringe error. The reporter described that the vaccine administrator was pregnant and was
splashed in the eye with vaccine during administration of the vaccine to a patient after the
needle detached from the syringe. No AE was experienced as a result of the exposure. No
information was available regarding infant outcome.

Author Manuscript

Deaths
We identified one death in the reports to VAERS following administration of Menveo. We
were unable to review medical records, autopsy reports or a death certificate for this report.
The report indicated receipt of Menveo concomitantly with Gardasil® and Havrix® 2
months prior to symptom onset, with a diagnosis of a brain tumor approximately 5 months
after vaccination.
Data mining

Author Manuscript

The data mining findings for all reported PTs by age group are shown in Table 4. The
disproportionately reported terms were predominantly related to handling or administration
errors, and in nearly all age groups, “no adverse event” was disproportionately reported. In
adults aged 19–44 years, an elevated EB05 was also observed for “syncope”, a finding that
is described in the manufacturer’s package insert.
When data mining was conducted for PTs in serious reports at any age, there were no
disproportionately reported AEs.

DISCUSSION

Author Manuscript

We completed a comprehensive review of AEs reported in the US after receipt of Menveo
from January 1, 2010 through December 31, 2015. Many of the most frequent AEs were
consistent with the data from pre-licensure trials of Menveo. These included injection-site
reactions (erythema, induration, pain) and selected systemic reactions (fever, irritability,
headache, nausea, and sleepiness). The majority of reports were received following
vaccination of adolescents (74%), the group for which meningococcal vaccine is routinely
recommended.
After clinical review of all serious reports, we found that anaphylaxis (7 reports) and
syncope (5 reports) were the two most common events reported; syncope was also one of the
most frequently observed MedDRA PTs in adults. While syncope is usually viewed as a
temporary and non-threatening condition, we found that the serious reports of syncope in
this study were labeled as such due to hospitalization for observation or to monitor for

potential concussions sustained during the syncopal episode. Both anaphylaxis and syncope
are known risks following any vaccine, and post-vaccination syncope (irrespective of
vaccine type) is more common in the adolescent and young adult age groups that are the
major recipients of meningococcal vaccines [21]. The most frequently observed SOC was
nervous system disorders, where we found 4 reports each of GBS and seizures. We did not
observe disproportionate reporting for either of these conditions in the data mining analysis.

Author Manuscript

To our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate AEs in women who have been
vaccinated with Menveo while pregnant. In the majority of the reports, women had been
vaccinated during the first trimester (often prior to knowledge of the pregnancy) and
experienced no AEs. Although the number of reports was small (n=14), the findings did not
provide any evidence for concern, as only one report noted a mild adverse event while the
remainder recorded inadvertent vaccination during pregnancy. Menveo is not contraindicated
during pregnancy. Our findings are consistent with a review of 80 reports to VAERS
following maternal immunization with another meningococcal conjugate vaccine, which did
not find any concerning patterns of AEs [1].

Author Manuscript

Multiple non-adverse event terms were frequently reported for Menveo and/or
disproportionately reported in the data mining analysis. These included “no adverse event”,
“drug administration error”, “incorrect drug dosage form administered”, “incorrect product
formulation administered”, “incorrect product storage”, “incorrect storage of drug”, “wrong
drug administered”, and “wrong technique in drug usage process”. A recent publication
describing reports to VAERS of administration errors after Menveo found that in 346 of the
407 reported errors, no adverse event was experienced [13]. The frequency of similar
findings in our study highlights the importance of vaccine providers adhering to the proper
administration of this vaccine as described in the package insert.
In recent years, concerns have arisen regarding dysautonomic syndromes such as postural
orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) following HPV vaccine [22]. In our study, one
case of POTS was reported following vaccination with Menveo, TDaP and HPV vaccines
and one case of orthostatic hypotension dysautonomic syndrome was reported following
vaccination with Menveo and TDaP. In addition, the data mining analysis did not find
disproportionate reporting of PTs suggestive of dysautonomic syndromes, which is a
reassuring finding.

Author Manuscript

Strengths of VAERS include its national scope and ability to process reports in a timely
manner, making it potentially useful for detection of vaccine safety signals for further
investigation. Limitations include those inherent to passive surveillance systems, including
under- or over-reporting, biased reporting, and inconsistency of quality and completeness of
reports. Additionally, reports may not contain sufficient detail for verification or
classification of certain outcomes which require very specific and complete medical records
(for example, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis). Finally, VAERS data do not include an
unvaccinated comparator group, therefore preventing an assessment of causality.
From 2010 through 2015, approximately 8.2 million doses of Menveo were distributed for
use within the US (data shown with permission of GSK, personal communication). The

calculated crude reporting rate was approximately 32 per 100,000 doses distributed for all
reports and 0.8/100,000 doses distributed for serious reports. Our analysis did not reveal any
unexpected findings or patterns of AEs after Menveo. This represents the first
comprehensive, published assessment of post-licensure safety of Menveo and adds to the
existing knowledge base regarding the safety of meningococcal vaccines.
