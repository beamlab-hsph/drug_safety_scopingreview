Abstract
We report initial experiments for analyzing social media
through an NLP annotation tool on web posts about
medications of current interests (baclofen, levothyroxine and
vaccines) and summaries of product characteristics (SPCs).
We conducted supervised experiments on a subset of messages
annotated by experts according to positive or negative misuse;
results ranged from 0.62 to 0.91 of F-score. We also
annotated both SPCs and another set of posts to compare
MedDRA annotations in each source. A pharmacovigilance
expert checked the output and confirmed that entities not
found in SCPs might express drug misuse or unknown ADRs.

Introduction
According to the World Health Organization (WHO),
pharmacovigilance is "the science and activities relating to the
detection, assessment, understanding and preventing of
adverse effects or any other drug-related problem".1 The drug
development process has several steps, from discovery in a
laboratory, to preclinical research and clinical development
involving patients. Nonetheless, after approval, complete and
definitive information about drug safety is not available.
Moreover, the drug use may change, the benefit/risk may
evolve and health authorities need any information available.
Self-reports of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are scarce: the
French National Agency for Drug Safety (ANSM) evaluated
that only 5% are reported by patients. Because ADRs are
known late, except in case of highly publicized events (e.g.,
H1N1 flu), social media is used to improve
pharmacovigilance efficiency [1,2]. However, web-based data
generally contain colloquial jargon that is hard to process with
common Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools, calling
for dedicated approaches [3]. Pharmacovigilance also
addresses abuse and drugs misuse, which involves “situations
where a medicinal product is intentionally and inappropriately
used not in accordance with the terms of the marketing
authorization” [4].

We present an ongoing work on pharmacovigilance analyses
in health fora written in French, with a special focus on drug
misuse. We present the experiments we made based on a
comparison of the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory
Activities (MedDRA) codes annotated in web messages and
the codes identified in Summaries of Product Characteristics
(SPCs). As far as we know, this source has not been
commonly used for NLP in health social media; this is our
main contribution. We annotated pathological conditions in
social media and SPCs using an NLP pipeline designed to
identify such entities [5]. This tool was improved for
normalizing annotations based on codes from MedDRA [6]
and the Anatomical Therapeutic Classification (ATC) [7].
These methods identify potential drug misuse and unknown
ADRs.

Background
Social media are useful to identify both adverse effects and
drug misuse [1,2,8]. Different types of drug misuse may
occur; Bigeard and colleagues report a comprehensive
typology [9]. Misuse may be related to whether the drug is
prescribed by a practitioner, or taken as self-medication. In
case of a prescription drug, misuse may involve interaction
with other drugs, an incorrect frequency, duration or dose of
medication intake. Other situations involve not respecting the
drug intake (e.g., if levothyroxine is not taken on an empty
stomach), or problems of conservation (e.g., to keep an eye
drop solution open for more than 2 weeks). Indication misuse
involves the intake of a medication for an unrelated pathology
(e.g., using baclofen for alcohol addiction). Another situation
of interest is drug abuse, which occurs when users take drugs
without any pathology but searching for a specific effect (e.g.,
a psychotropic effect, as is the case with the purple drank
cocktail based on codeine cough syrup with soda).
Detection of drug misuse in social media is hard to identify
automatically, since knowledge on a given medical drug
indications or posology are needed to infer unexpected user’s
intake behaviors. The few works undertaken to detect drug
misuse have applied supervised methods and annotated data
by pharmacovigilance experts [10].
In the absence of enough available annotated data, we resorted
to methods for generating training data over unlabeled
samples. Distant supervision approaches [11] are close to that
paradigm and have been applied in the medical domain [12].
Our method, however, relies on the annotation of knowledge

sources (SPCs in our context of pharmacovigilance) and then
compares the output to annotations in web fora.

Methods
We conducted two types of experiments. First, we conducted
a supervised experiment with a small set of messages
annotated by pharmacovigilance experts regarding positive or
negative misuse. Second, we tested to which extend
comparing MedDRA codes found in messages from web fora
and in SPCs provide cues of drug misuse and unknown side
effects.
Corpus for Supervised Experiments
Corpus 1 contains posts written in French by consumers,
extracted from several public fora from the health domain:
AlloDocteurs,2 Atoute,3 Baclofène,4 Doctisimo Médicaments,5
eSanté,6 Journal des Femmes,7 and Vulgaris.8 In these posts,
different drugs and pharmacological substances are discussed:
Agomelatine (Valdoxan®): an antidepressant, which may be
misused for insomnia, panic and anxiety attacks.
Baclofen: a muscle relaxant, used to treat addictions
(especially alcoholism) out of any marketing authorization.
Duloxetine (Cymbalta®): an antidepressant drug.
Exenatide (Bietta®): an antidiabetic injection; a dose misuse
(i.e., users took more injections than what is prescribed) has
been detected by pharmacovigilance experts.
Myolastan (Tetrazepam®): a muscle relaxant; both misuse
(indication and posology) and drug abuse has been reported.
Messages were collected with a framework for extracting data
from web fora [13] and then processed using an NLP pipeline
to annotate pathological and medical drug entities.
Pharmacovigilance experts—pharmacists, or physicians
qualified in Pharmacology—revised a selection of 1178 posts
and manually annotated them as expressing misuse or not.

compulsory: tetanus, diphtheria, poliomyelitis, and 8
additional ones: pertussis, polio, measles, mumps,
rubella, hepatitis B, haemophilus influenza bacteria,
pneumococcus, and meningococcus C. We used
posts from the Doctissimo website.10
For each topic, we extracted 100 messages according to two
inclusion criteria: presence of drug name and pathology
names, and a limit of words (we avoided long generic
discussions). In case of lack of messages with drug names and
pathology entities, we extracted new messages to gather up to
100 messages per topic. We also used SPCs available from the
French authorities11 for baclofen, levothyroxine, and the
twenty marketed products to perform the newborns
immunization for the eleven vaccines: ACT-HIB®, Boostrix
Tetra®, Engerix B®, Fendrix®, HBVaxPro®, Hexyon®,
Imovax Polio®, Infanrix Tetra®, Infanrix Quinta®, Infanrix
Hexa®,
M-M-RVaxPro®,
Menjugate®,
Neisvac®,
Pentavac®, Pneumovax®, Prevenar®, Priorix®, Repevax®,
Revaxis®, and Tetravac®. We focused on sections describing
indications, counter-indications or adverse drug reactions.
Annotation of Messages with an NLP Pipeline
We applied an NLP pipeline on both corpus: 1178 posts
annotated by pharmacovigilance experts, and 300 concerning
levothyroxine, baclofen and vaccines. As previously
explained [5], the pipeline has modules for normalization,
tokenization, Part-of-Speech tagging and concept annotation
based on machine learning, namely Conditional Random
Fields (CRF) [14]. Because the tool was improved since the
first evaluation made on the first set of web fora [5], we
evaluated the annotations of the 300 posts. We manually
checked those annotations to build a gold standard, using
BRAT (Figure 1) [15]. We evaluated the annotations through
pre-cision, recall and F1-score (F1) metrics using BRATeval
[16].

Corpus for Comparing Internet Posts and SPCs
Corpus 2 gathers posts from similar kind of consumers’ web.
We chose three specific and actual drug topics (regarding the
media coverage and patients’ interest), each in different fora:
1. Baclofen: data come from the Atoute website and
were used in semi-automatic methods to detect drug
misuse.
2. Levothyroxine: this drug replaces or provides more
thyroid hormone, and a new formulation was
marketed in August 2017. Messages come from the
Vivre sans thyroïde forum.9
3. Vaccines: in France, only 3 vaccines (diphtheria,
tetanus, poliomyelitis) were mandatory until
January 1st, 2018. Since that date, 11 vaccines are

We also applied the annotation tool on the summary of
product characteristics (SPCs) detailed before. Thus,
pathological entities in indications covered by those selected
drugs are annotated and labeled with MedDRA codes. We
also revised the annotations of sections Indications and Side
effects in SPCs, using the same methodology to revise
annotated posts.
Experiments in a Supervised Context
We followed the procedures applied by Bigeard and
colleagues [10]. We tested Naïve Bayes (NB) and

L. Campillos-Llanos et al. / Initial Experiments for Pharmacovigilance Analysis in Social Media

Multinomial Naïve Bayes (MBN) algorithms on the
1178 posts annotated as expressing misuse or not by
pharmacovigilance experts. We tested different features:
Word tokens in message
Word roots in message
Anatomical Therapeutic Classification (ATC) codes
of medical drugs in each message
MedDRA codes of pathologic entities in message
3-grams
3-character-grams
We used ScikitLearn Software for this set of experiments [17].
In all contexts, we applied 10-fold cross-validation and used
an 80% and 20% ratio of training and test sets, respectively.
We also tested different subsets of messages with regard to the
number of messages annotated as misuse. In real-life contexts,
most posts will not contain any misuse behavior or ADR. The
datasets will suffer from class imbalance (i.e., most samples
will not express misuse nor ADRs), a common problem with
supervised machine-learning algorithms [18]. In a context
where most posts bear a negative class, a random classifier or
a classifier labeling all samples as negative will certainly have
good accuracy, even though it does not make use of any
linguistic or knowledge-based feature. We thus tested
different ratios of messages annotated as positive or negative
misuse:
The full corpus of messages (1178 posts),
111 messages annotated as positive misuse (~10:1
ratio)
A subset of 336 messages: 111 classified as positive
misuse and 225 as negative misuse (~2:1 ratio)
A subset of 246 messages: 111 classified as positive
misuse and 135 as negative misuse (~1:1 ratio)

Results

We annotated a total of 2249 pathologies and medications in
forums, and 6772 in the SPCs (Table 1; we report the count of
both annotations and types, i.e., different annotated items).

Once we applied the NLP tool to annotate the pathological
entities in the SPCs, we assumed these coded pathologies set
up the list of correct uses to be found in messages over the
Internet. Conversely, all pathologies related to one of those
drugs found in a message (missing in that list of expected
pathologies) may be a drug misuse or unexpected ADR.
Because we used the same annotation schema and tool, we
could compare MedDRA codes in both sets and extracted a
list of candidate terms. Finally, a pharmacovigilance expert
and coauthor of this work (ALL)—a physician, qualified in
Pharmacology, with 20 years of expertise—checked the
selected entities to confirm misuse behavior or unknown
ADRs.

Normalization
We used MedDRA for coding terms of pathological entities.
Following Bousquet et al. [19], we coded Lower-level terms
(LLT) for expressions of pathologies (verbatim terms), but
also mapped these LLTs to preferred terms (PT) for pharmacovigilance analyses. We used the UMLS® [20] Concept
Unique Identifiers (CUIs) to map term variants referring to the
same concept. Normalization rules were applied considering
inflection (singular/plural, diacritics, syntactic variants of
multiwords); and Levenshtein distances were used to get the
candidate term with closer string distance from a term variant.

In web posts, higher F1 scores were obtained when annotating
medications rather than pathological entities. This is mainly
due to the higher number of different pathological entities
(480) and also to the difficulty in annotating expressions of
pathological conditions in patient language (e.g., crevé, ‘worn
out’ stands for fatigue). Annotation results of messages
concerning the baclofen and levothyroxine show higher F1
scores; this might be due to the fact that messages discussing
newborns vaccination contain more different drug names (83).
Results of pathological entities in posts regarding the
levothyroxine might also be due to a higher number of
different pathological entities in this forum (230). Because
SPCs feature a lower degree of patient language, annotation
of pathologies achieved a higher F1 score than in web fora.
Results of Supervised Experiments
As expected, the best results were obtained on the full corpus,
either using Naïve Bayes or Multinomial Naïve Bayes (Table
3; we only report the results of the best features on the test
set). The experiments on the other corpora configurations
helped us better understand the features that really helped the
classifier to learn and distinguish positive and negative

misuse. The best results were mainly obtained with these
features: ATC codes, MedDRA codes and word roots. We had
similar results as those reported by Bigeard et al. [10].

dose might be expressed with specific verbs. However, in the
Corpus 1, we observed that experts did not always annotate as
misuse some contexts with those cues. Exact validation of
drug doses reported by web users might indeed be within the
range of correct doses that could be a user-perceived misuse.
We estimate a linguistic analysis needs to be complemented
by knowledge-driven approaches; e.g., analyses of doses in
posts may be compared with ranges of doses approved by
authorities. Likewise, we noticed that possible adverse drug
reactions or misuse events were not detected due to the lack of
MedDRA terms, especially when users write narrative
descriptions of events or use non-technical expressions.

Results of the Normalization Step
Applying the normalization rules on Corpus 2, we mapped to
CUIs 263 out of the 344 different types of pathologies (76.4%
of types), and 199 to MedDRA codes (57.8% of types). Errors
were due to spelling, syntactic variation (treatment failure vs.
failure of treatment), inflection (panic attack vs. panic
attacks), derivation (depressive vs. depression), abbreviations
(rgo vs. reflux gastroesophagique) or errors in CUI mappings.

Results of comparing messages in social media and SPCs
We extracted from posts 301 pathological entities that were
not documented in SPCs. Most were related to Levothyroxine
(166) and Baclofen (103). Pathologic conditions related to
vaccines (32) concerned Boostrix®, Engerix®, Infanrix®,
Neisvac®, Pentavac®, Prevenar®, Priorix®, Repevax® and
Revaxis®. We observed that some vaccines did not appear in
the selected posts (ACT-HIB®, Fendrix®, HBVaxPro®,
Hexyon®, Imovax Polio®, Infanrix Tetra®, M-M-RVaxPro®,
Pneumovax® and Tetravac®). The pharmacovigilance expert
considered that only 3 cases might be misuse related to
Baclofen (1.3% of candidate items). However, one case is
ambiguous: we cannot state if, when the user mentioned the
unexpected pathology, he/she meant to link it to an indication
related to the intake of Baclofen. No other misuse cue was
confirmed with regard to other drugs. The expert identified 68
undocumented ADRs (22.6% of selected items; 28 need more
context to be confirmed). Unknown ADRs mostly involved
levothyroxine (52 cases), baclofen (6), Engerix® (2),
Infanrix® (2), Pentavac® (3), Priorix® (1) and Repevax® (2).
Qualitative Evaluation
We analyzed messages to detect linguistic cues expressing
drug indication or misuse (Table 4). Misuse due to incorrect

Discussion
Communication in Internet fora is asynchronous and
asymmetric, without specific interlocutors. This impacts the
way medical information is expressed: incomplete, informal
and creative expressions for health conditions abound, which
make it difficult concept normalization and automatic analyses
through NLP. Comparing pathological entities documented in
SPCs medical drugs and unexpected pathologies in social
media needs quality term detection and normalization. Our
work is thus preliminary and suffers from the limitation that
terms in patient language remained still unannotated, or
entities were not normalized to accurate terms or CUIs.
Moreover, we did not check the quality and correctness of the
normalization step. We would like to explore normalization
techniques based on word-embeddings and deep-learning. The
comparison method was weak for detecting misuse, but
helped in finding new ADRs; this opens the door to future
work.
Regarding our supervised experiment, we lack enough data
for training our model and generalizing our predictions on
drug misuse to new datasets. We want to annotate SPCs of
more medical drugs to gather a database of annotations to be

64

used in future work, especially for distant supervision
approaches.
Using social media brings up other limitations related to: 1)
the fact that users may not necessarily post their misuse
behavior or ADRs; and 2) privacy concerns: despite users post
contents to be publicly available, careful anonymization
protocols are required, as we applied in the project [13].

Conclusions
We presented a method and initial experiments on pharmacovigilance analyses on social media based on NLP annotations
of web fora. Through a supervised experiment with a minimal
set of data, we showed that classification models might
perform adequately. However, lacking of enough data to
address current medications of interest, we resorted to
Summary of Product Characteristics (SPCs) to overcome the
data bottleneck. This approach, as far as we know, has not
commonly being used and might be a source of knowledge for
contrasting data reported in SPCs and unexpected users’
health or conditions. A pharmacovigilance expert confirmed
possible cases of misuse and some unknown ADRs. We make
available the annotated data of SPCs.12
We highlight that our methods do not aim at replacing human
decisions concerning users’ behavior that could be drug
misuse. These need pharmacovigilance experts to be
validated; luckily, automated methods supporting these tasks
make this validation faster and easier to be conducted.
