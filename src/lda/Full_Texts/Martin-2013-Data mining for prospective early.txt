Abstract
Background Reports of data mining results as an initial
indication of a prospectively detected safety signal in the
US Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS)
have been limited. In April 2010 a vaccine safety signal for
febrile seizures after FluvaxÒ and FluvaxÒ Junior was
identified in Australia without the aid of data mining. In
order to refine Northern Hemisphere influenza vaccine
safety surveillance, VAERS data mining analyses based on
vaccine brand name were initiated during the 2010–2011
influenza season.
Objective We describe the strategies that led to the
finding of a novel safety signal using empirical Bayesian
data mining.
Methods The primary US VAERS analysis calculated an
empirical Bayesian geometric mean (EBGM), which was
adjusted for age group, sex and year received. A secondary
age-stratified analysis calculated a separate EBGM for 11
pre-defined age subsets. These bi-weekly analyses were
generated with database restrictions that separated live and
inactivated vaccines as well as with the US VAERS database. A cutoff of 2.0 at the fifth percentile of the confidence
interval (CI) for the EBGM, the EB05, was used to identify
vaccine adverse event combinations for further evaluation.
Examination of potential interactions among concomitantly
administered vaccines is based on the Interaction Signal
Score (INTSS), which is a relative measure of how much
excess disproportionality is present in the three-dimensional combination of two vaccines and one adverse event

term. An INTSS [1 indicates that the CI for the threedimensional analysis is larger than and does not overlap
with the CI from the highest two-dimensional analysis. We
subsequently examined the possibility of masking by
removing all 2,095 FluzoneÒ2010-2011 reports from the 10
December 2010 version of the VAERS database. In addition, we calculated relative reporting ratios to observe the
relative contribution of adjustment and the Multi-Item
Gamma Poisson Shrinker (MGPS) algorithm to EBGM
values.
Results On 10 December 2010, US VAERS analyses we
found an EB05 [2 for FluzoneÒ2010-2011 and the Medical
Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRAÒ) term
‘‘febrile seizure’’. MedDRAÒ terminology is the medical
terminology developed under the auspices of the International Conference on Harmonization of technical requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use
(ICH). No other vaccine products had independent vaccinefebrile seizure combinations with an EB05 [2. Threedimensional analyses to examine possible interactions
among vaccine products concomitantly administered
with FluzoneÒ2010-2011 yielded Interaction Signal Score
values \1. Removal of all FluzoneÒ2010-2011 reports from
the VAERS database failed to demonstrate a previously
masked vaccine adverse event pair with an EB05 [2. The
inactivated vaccine database restriction resulted in a 41 %
reduction in background VAERS reports and a 24 %
reduction in foreground VAERS reports.
Conclusion Empirical Bayesian data mining in VAERS
prospectively detected the safety signal for febrile seizures
after FluzoneÒ2010-2011 in young children. The EB05
threshold, database restrictions, adjustment and baseline
data mining were strategies adopted a priori to enhance the
specificity of the 2010–2011 influenza vaccine data mining
analyses. A database restriction used to separate live

548

vaccines resulted in a reduced EB05. Adjustment of data
mining analyses had a larger effect on estimates of disproportionality than the MGPS algorithm. Masking did not
appear to influence our findings. This case study illustrates
the value of VAERS data mining for vaccine safety
monitoring.

1 Introduction
The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) defines a
signal as ‘‘a concern about an excess of adverse events
compared to what would be expected to be associated with
a product’s use’’ [1]. However, rates cannot be calculated
from the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System
(VAERS), a spontaneous reporting system. Data mining
addresses the inherent limitation of absent denominator
data by screening the VAERS database for higher than
expected proportions of vaccine-event combinations [2, 3].
In order to determine if a vaccine-event combination of
interest represents a signal, additional scientific review is
necessary. Data mining may be used to contribute to a
variety of pharmacovigilance objectives including: signal
detection, strengthening or weakening of existing safety
signals detected by data mining, providing evidence for or
against existing safety concerns not previously evaluated
using data mining, evaluation of vaccine-vaccine interactions, and identification of novel signals related to a known
signal (e.g., multiple adverse events in a syndrome) [4].
A variety of quantitative methods can be used to detect
disproportionality among spontaneous adverse event
reports. Such methods and their statistical outputs include
the proportional reporting ratio (PRR), reporting odds ratio
(ROR) and the empirical Bayesian geometric mean
(EBGM), and they are described elsewhere [5–8]. An
advantage of Bayesian data mining over other methods is
its minimization of false-positive signals due to ‘‘shrinkage’’ towards the null with low observed or expected
counts. The utility of applying empirical Bayesian data
mining to vaccine safety monitoring has been previously
demonstrated retrospectively in a study indicating that a
signal for intussusception after a rotavirus vaccine could
have theoretically been detected months earlier [9]. Subsequently, data mining findings of vaccine-associated
adverse events were reported including photophobia after
smallpox vaccine [10], Guillain Barré syndrome after trivalent influenza vaccine [11] and syncope after quadrivalent human papillomavirus vaccine [12]. Data mining in
VAERS has been used to screen vaccine-event combinations from the point of view of a specific adverse event
(e.g., thrombocytopenia [13]) or a single vaccine (e.g.,
anthrax vaccine [14]). In most of these previously reported
data mining findings, the information was supportive of

D. Martin et al.

findings from other monitoring methods, rather than the
first indication of a novel safety signal.
In the 2010–2011 Northern Hemisphere influenza season, influenza vaccination was recommended in the USA
for all adults as well as all children aged 6 months and
older [15]. To match circulating influenza strains the
influenza vaccine is typically changed each year, and in
2010 the influenza A (H1N1) pandemic strain was added to
the seasonal influenza vaccine products distributed in the
USA. Estimated coverage among children aged 6 months
to 4 years for the 2010–2011 season was 63.6 % (95 %
confidence interval [CI] 61.9–65.3) based on the National
Immunization Survey [16].
Because prudent pharmacovigilance necessitates strategies for detecting novel safety signals for different seasonal
formulations of specific influenza vaccine products, adoption of data mining by influenza vaccine brand name rather
than product class was planned in early 2010. This productspecific approach provided consistency with the FDA’s
product-focused mission and gained added impetus after
April 2010 when the Australian Therapeutic Goods
Administration identified a safety signal for febrile seizures
in young children following vaccination with FluvaxÒ and
FluvaxÒ Junior (CSL, Parkeville, VIC, Australia). An
increased risk was not documented with other seasonal
trivalent influenza products distributed in Australia at the
time [17]. This example highlighted the need to differentiate data mining findings by specific vaccine product in
order to refine signal identification. Consequently, routine
influenza vaccine data mining during the 2010–2011
Northern Hemisphere influenza season was conducted
separately for each of the eight then US-licensed and marketed seasonal trivalent influenza vaccines, each of
which contained antigenically equivalent influenza strains
to those present in the CSL influenza vaccine formulation
associated with febrile seizures [18]. We report the methods of and findings from this surveillance effort resulting in
the initial detection of a new important safety signal.

2 Methods
The VAERS is the US national surveillance system for
monitoring vaccine safety. VAERS accepts spontaneous
reports of post-vaccination adverse events from a variety of
sources including vaccine manufacturers, healthcare providers and the public. In 2010, VAERS received *38,000
reports of *37,000 events, *5,000 of which were serious
(characterized by death, hospitalization, prolonged hospitalization, disability, life-threatening-illness or birth defect)
[19]. VAERS has many limitations including underreporting, variable degree of individual report detail and
accuracy, duplicate reports, lack of control groups for

Data Mining for Detection of Signals in VAERS

comparison and lack of denominator data (i.e., number of
vaccine doses administered), as well as strengths including
its national scope and the timeliness of reported events
(enabling near real-time capturing of data) [20]. Although
it is generally not possible to establish causality from
VAERS reports alone, VAERS can be helpful in identifying and generating hypotheses about potential rare vaccineassociated adverse events that may be undetectable in premarketing clinical trials (e.g., due to sample size limitations or selection criteria).
Among other routine product-specific safety surveillance duties, medical epidemiologists in the FDA’s Center
for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) review data
mining output from EmpiricaÒ data mining software
(Version 7.2, Oracle), which is generally refreshed
biweekly. EmpiricaÒ draws upon a background of all
VAERS reports since establishment of the database in
1990, and it provides an adjusted ratio of observed to
expected counts of vaccine-adverse event combinations
that is derived exclusively from ‘‘numerator’’ (i.e., number
of events reported for each vaccine-event pair) data.
Reports without a brand name are excluded from these
analyses. Adverse events are encoded from the text of
VAERS reports using Medical Dictionary for Regulatory
Activities (MedDRAÒ, Version 13.0) preferred terms
(PTs). Initially, EmpiricaÒ calculates the relative reporting
ratio, which is the observed number of reports containing a
specific vaccine-adverse event PT pair divided by the
expected number of reports containing this pair. The
expected count of this pair (if the vaccine and adverse
event PT were independent) is calculated by multiplying
the proportion of reports with the specific vaccine, the
proportion of reports with the specific PT, and the total
number of reports in the database. The relative reporting
ratio can be adjusted for one or more categorically defined
potential confounders by calculating stratum-specific
expected counts. The proportion of reports within a specific
stratum for a specific vaccine is multiplied by the proportion of reports within this stratum with a specific PT and
the total number of reports in the stratum. The adjusted
relative reporting ratio is the observed number of a specific
vaccine-adverse event PT combination divided by the sum
of the stratum-specific expected counts. After calculating a
relative reporting ratio or an adjusted relative reporting
ratio, EmpiricaÒ uses the Multi-Item Gamma Poisson
Shrinker (MGPS) algorithm to calculate the EBGM. The
MGPS algorithm addresses the multiple-comparisons
concern stemming from the determination of relative
reporting ratios for thousands of vaccine-adverse event
pairs [21]. We routinely use a cutoff value of 2 at the lower
bound (EB05) of the 90 % CI surrounding the EBGM to
identify vaccine-event combinations of interest since this
threshold has been shown to indicate sufficient specificity

549

to warrant further evaluation [22]. The upper bound of this
CI is referred to as the EB95. An EB05 [2 provides a high
degree of confidence that a vaccine-event pair has been
reported at least twice as frequently as would be expected
when compared with reports for the same adverse event
and other vaccines in the background database.
In addition to adjusting the calculation of the relative
reporting ratio for potential confounders, we routinely
customize our data mining strategies through database
restrictions and subsets. Two routine vaccine product-specific data mining analyses were used prior to and during the
2010–2011 Northern Hemisphere influenza season. The
primary analysis (Fig. 1) is restricted to USA or unknown
country reports and is adjusted for age group, sex and year
the FDA received the report. The majority of the reports
with missing country data originate in the USA. Hereafter,
this analysis is referred to as the ‘‘US VAERS’’ analysis. In
addition, a secondary analysis (Fig. 2), ‘‘US VAERS by
age group,’’ calculated a separate EBGM adjusted for sex
and year received for 11 pre-defined age subsets of the
VAERS database for each vaccine product. The 11 predefined data mining age groups identified by EmpiricaÒ
include 0 to \18 months, 18 to \54 months, 54 months
to \12.5 years, 12.5 years to \16.5 years, 16.5 years
to\29.5 years, 29.5 years to\45.5 years, 45.5 years to\64.5
years, 64.5 years to \75.5 years, 75.5 years to \85.5 years,
85.5 years and above, and age unknown. The effects
of data-mining stratification (through MGPS subsets) in
VAERS are discussed elsewhere [23–25]. Prior to 2010,
influenza product class (rather than vaccine brand name)
analyses were used. In addition, prior to and during the
2010–2011 Northern Hemisphere influenza season, the
VAERS database was segregated to enable the live attenuated influenza vaccine product to be assessed against a
background of live viral vaccine adverse event reports and
to enable the inactivated influenza vaccines to be assessed
against a background containing only inactivated vaccines
[26]. As a consequence of this database restriction, any
VAERS report with a live vaccine whether or not it also
contains an inactivated vaccine is excluded from the
inactivated vaccine data mining background. Hereafter,
primary and secondary analyses utilizing this database
restriction will be followed by the term ‘‘inactivated’’ in
parentheses.
When data mining analyses are conducted for a specific
vaccine brand name, the data mining outcome measure of
interest incorporates the entire post-marketing period for
the vaccine from initial licensure through the current
review period. Since influenza vaccines generally contain
new strains compared to prior seasons, they are considered
for data mining purposes to be ‘‘new’’ products at the
beginning of the influenza season and carry a suffix for that
influenza season. Reports with a vaccination date prior to 1

it allows three items per combination. The EB05 derived
from this higher order combination calculation is then
divided by the EB95 from the highest two-dimensional
(e.g., one vaccine and one adverse event PT) analysis. The
quotient is the Interaction Signal Score (INTSS), and an
INTSS [1 is the threshold for higher order disproportionality involving two vaccines and an adverse event PT that
cannot be explained solely by a single pairwise vaccine-PT
association. An INTSS [1 indicates that the CI for the
three-dimensional analysis is larger than and does not
overlap with the CI from the highest two-dimensional
analysis. Thus, the INTSS is a relative measure of how
much excess disproportionality is present in the threedimensional combination [27].

3 Results
The routine US VAERS (inactivated) by age group analysis
(based on the 23 November 2010 version of the VAERS
database) revealed an EB05 = 2.50 (EBGM = 4.08,
EB95 = 6.25, n = 15) for the ‘‘febrile convulsion’’ PT
paired with FluzoneÒ2010-2011 (Sanofi Pasteur Inc., Bridgewater, NJ, USA) trivalent inactivated influenza virus vaccine in the 0- to 18-month age group. The US VAERS
(inactivated) analysis combining all ages did not have an
EB05 value that exceeded our predetermined threshold of 2
for any other vaccine including FluzoneÒ2010-2011. In addition, the same runs conducted for FluzoneÒ using all prior
seasons combined (i.e., ‘‘baseline’’ data mining), did not
reveal an EB05 [2 for the ‘‘febrile convulsion’’ PT. Given
this new finding, we expanded our data mining evaluation
of FluzoneÒ2010-2011 to the US VAERS analysis, which
included both live and inactivated vaccines. In the US
VAERS analysis (Fig. 3) we found an EB05 = 2.52
(EBGM = 3.66, EB95 = 5.12, n = 35), and in the US
VAERS by age group analysis we found an EB05 = 2.68

(EBGM = 4.10, EB95 = 5.85, n = 22) in the 0- to
18-month age group. Clinical review confirmed 21 cases of
febrile seizure (using a case definition of a healthcare provider diagnosis of febrile seizure) after FluzoneÒ2010-2011 in
0- to 18-month age stratum and 13 additional (mostly
children 18–23 months old) cases of febrile seizure identified in US VAERS analysis. These cases were characterized
by age, sex, time to onset, concomitant vaccinations, seriousness, geographic location and vaccine lot (data not
shown). No other US licensed vaccine in routine US
VAERS analyses, including the other licensed influenza
vaccines available in the 2010–2011 season, had an
EB05 [2 for the ‘‘febrile convulsion’’ PT.
The 10 December 2010 version of the VAERS database
was used for additional two-dimensional analyses to see if
the FluzoneÒ2010-2011 febrile seizure signal persisted. The
results of the two-dimensional analyses were similar to
those from 23 November 2010. In the US VAERS analysis
for all age groups we found an EB05 = 2.44
(EBGM = 3.36, EB95 = 4.60, n = 41) and in the US
VAERS by age group analysis we found an EB05 = 2.92
(EBGM = 4.15, EB95 = 5.66, n = 28) in the 0- to
18-month age group. No other vaccine products had independent vaccine-febrile seizure combinations with an
EB05 [2.0, and Table 1 depicts results for those vaccines
concomitantly administered with FluzoneÒ2010-2011. We
also conducted three-dimensional analyses to examine
possible interactions among vaccines concomitantly
administered with FluzoneÒ2010-2011. There was no evidence for synergy because the INTSS values for these
products were all \1.0 (Table 1).
The FluzoneÒ2010-2011 febrile seizure signal persisted
over time. Data mining findings from the 29 December
2010 version of the VAERS database were similar to those
from 10 December 2010. In the US VAERS analysis we
found an EB05 = 2.56 (EBGM = 3.46, EB95 = 4.60,
n = 47) and in the US VAERS by age group analysis we

found an EB05 = 2.98 (EBGM = 4.11, EB95 = 5.48,
n = 32) in the 0- to 18-month age group. Vaccines
reported to VAERS as concomitantly administered with
FluzoneÒ2010-2011 continued to have no independent findings for febrile seizure. Subsequently, the US Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and FDA shared the
FluzoneÒ2010-2011 febrile seizure VAERS findings publicly
via a press release and web postings [28, 29].
Prevnar 13Ò (Pfizer Inc., New York, NY, USA) was the
only newly licensed and recommended vaccine (other than
the 2010–2011 influenza strain change) for children under
the age of 5 years during the 2010–2011 influenza season
[30]. To ensure that we did not overlook a possible signal
from Prevnar 13Ò, we examined the possible contribution
of observed values, stratification and shrinkage to the
finding that the Prevnar 13Ò-febrile seizure combination
did not exceed our predetermined threshold in the US
VAERS analysis. The crude relative reporting ratio for the
FluzoneÒ-febrile seizure combination (2.28) was lower
than that for the Prevnar 13Ò-febrile seizure combination
(3.75) (Tables 2, 3). However, adjustment nearly tripled
the expected value for the Prevnar 13Ò-febrile seizure
combination from 11.2 to 31.3, and the resulting relative
reporting ratio for this combination was reduced to 1.34
(Table 4). MGPS shrinkage played a smaller role in the
reduction of the point estimate of disproportionate

reporting than adjustment, and the EBGM for the Prevnar
13Ò-febrile convulsion combination was 1.29 with an
EB05 of 1.00 (Table 4).
We examined the possibility that a signal from Prevnar
Ò
13 was masked by removing all 2,095 FluzoneÒ2010-2011
reports from the 10 December 2010 version of the VAERS
database. This sensitivity analysis necessarily resulted in
the removal of all concomitant vaccination reports listed in
Table 2. In spite of the removal of the FluzoneÒ2010-2011
reports, no vaccine had a two-dimensional combination
with an EB05 [2. Indeed, measures of disproportionate
reporting actually decreased after FluzoneÒ2010-2011 reports
were removed (Table 5).
Because the US VAERS (inactivated) analysis did not
have an EB05 value that exceeded our predetermined
threshold of 2 while the 0- to 18-month age subset of the
US VAERS (inactivated) by age group analysis exceed this
threshold, we examined the effect of our database restriction (Table 6). In the US VAERS analysis there were 41
reports with FluzoneÒ2010-2011 and the PT ‘‘febrile convulsion’’, and the EB05 was 2.44. The inactivated vaccine
database restriction resulted in a 41 % reduction in background VAERS reports. Although foreground VAERS
reports (i.e., those with FluzoneÒ2010-2011 and the PT
‘‘febrile convulsion’’) were only reduced by 24 %, the
resulting EB05 of 1.89 did not reach our threshold. In
the 0- to 18-month age group, nearly half of the
FluzoneÒ2010-2011 ‘‘febrile convulsion’’ PT pairs were
preserved in the foreground while there was a simultaneous
92 % reduction in the size of the VAERS background. This
reduced the expected count within the 0- to 18-month
stratum, and the resulting EB05 was 2.62.

4 Discussion and Conclusion
This report describes the initial identification of a vaccine
safety signal using empirical Bayesian data mining of the
VAERS database rather than traditional pharmacovigilance
methods such as expert review and calculation of reporting
rates. Despite advances in population-based active surveillance, passive surveillance systems remain an important component of post-marketing safety monitoring efforts
in order to detect unexpected adverse events that have not
been prespecified in active surveillance systems. To date,
demonstration that VAERS data mining methods can prospectively identify important safety signals in a timely
fashion has been limited. Conducting clinical and epidemiological evaluations of disproportional vaccine event
pairs is resource intensive [31], and this case study demonstrates the value of optimizing the application of data
mining to spontaneous reporting system databases. For
influenza products, the EB05 threshold, adjustment and

baseline data mining (which served as an additional gauge
of unexpectedness), were strategies adopted a priori to
enhance the specificity of the 2010–2011 data mining
surveillance plan.
The signal for febrile seizures after FluzoneÒ2010-2011
identified in the 0- to 18-month age group of the US
VAERS (inactivated) by age group analysis was not
observed in the US VAERS (inactivated) analysis with all
ages combined. Two elements might have contributed to a
decrease in the relative reporting ratio and the empirical
Bayesian geometric mean in the US VAERS (inactivated)
analysis relative to the US VAERS analysis. First, this
analysis excluded cases that had concomitant live vaccines,
and the relative reporting ratio is sensitive to decreases in
vaccine-event combination counts. Second, it has been
noted that relative reporting ratios are proportional to the
total number of reports in the database when all other
factors are held constant [32]. The US VAERS analysis had
more cases and more reports than the US VAERS (inactivated) analysis. The US VAERS (inactivated) by age
group analysis met the EB05 [2 threshold because the
expected count was dramatically reduced in the 0- to
18-month age subset (Table 6), while the majority (58 %)
of inactivated US VAERS cases were retained. Beginning
with the 2011–2012 Northern Hemisphere influenza season, FDA CBER utilized the overall US VAERS background for influenza vaccine data mining. This harmonized
our data mining architecture with the architecture utilized
for non-influenza vaccine data mining, and it allowed our
pharmacovigilance group to avoid the limitations of database restrictions.
Data mining in VAERS detected an independent signal
for febrile seizures after FluzoneÒ2010-2011 with no independent signal after any concomitant vaccines. Nearly

identical crude counts of vaccine ‘‘febrile convulsion’’ PT
pairs were noted for Prevnar 13Ò and FluzoneÒ2010-2011,
and there were 1,304 Prevnar 13Ò reports and 2,095
FluzoneÒ2010-2011 reports. This resulted in a crude relative
reporting ratio that was actually higher for the Prevnar
13Ò-febrile seizure pair than for the FluzoneÒ-febrile seizure pair. Comparison of the crude and adjusted relative
reporting ratios demonstrates that adjustment played an
important role in the calculation of the final EBGM. Since
both vaccines were licensed and recommended for similar
periods of time and there were no sex-specific usage differences, we infer that age was the strongest contributor to
the adjustment. This finding demonstrates the value of a
disproportionality reporting method that is able to adjust
for a confounder that is associated with both administration
of Prevnar 13Ò (and FluzoneÒ2010-2011 to a lesser extent)
and febrile seizures.
Due to concerns about febrile seizures after a southern
hemisphere influenza vaccine, active surveillance in the US
CDC Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD) for febrile seizures
was already underway [33]. As a result of the data mining
finding in VAERS and a concurrent signal for febrile seizures after trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine in the
VSD, additional VSD analyses were planned to determine
attributable risks for febrile seizures and to examine the
possible contribution of concomitant vaccinations. A subsequent joint signal evaluation in the VSD indicated an
association with febrile seizures that was strongest when
FluzoneÒ2010-2011 and Prevnar 13Ò were concomitantly
administered to children aged 12–23 months [34]. Potential
explanations for differential results in the VSD and
VAERS include possible under-reporting in VAERS,
masking in VAERS data mining, and differential patterns
of FluzoneÒ2010-2011 and Prevnar 13Ò utilization in the
VSD population relative to the source population for

VAERS. Under-reporting and differential patterns of utilization in the source population for VAERS cannot be
empirically tested in this passive surveillance database
alone. However, when FluzoneÒ2010-2011 reports were
removed from the database, the independent Prevnar 13Òfebrile seizure combination EB05 decreased from 1.00 to
0.88. Since the measures of disproportionate reporting did
not increase with removal of FluzoneÒ2010-2011, we conclude that masking did not play a significant role in our
findings. Likewise, removal of Prevnar 13Ò from the
database did not increase the EB05 for FluzoneÒ2010-2011.
Data mining in VAERS has multiple limitations. False
disproportionality findings could arise in VAERS from
stimulated reporting (e.g., due to a publication) as well as
from unique characteristics of products (e.g., recent licensure) or product-adverse event pairs (e.g., confounding by
indication). Influenza vaccines may be additionally subject
to a seasonality bias if an adverse event such as febrile
seizures disproportionally occurs during the influenza
season. Data mining findings may be further limited by
several factors related to the use of coding terms as proxies
for underlying events. PTs reflecting more readily identifiable symptoms/diagnoses (e.g., ‘‘mental status changes’’
rather than ‘‘acute disseminated encephalomyelitis’’ in the
same patient) are more likely to be coded after VAERS
data obtained early in the evolution of an adverse event is
reviewed. Additional medical records that may result in
revised coding are sought for VAERS reports associated
with administration of any vaccine if the clinical situation
is consistent with the regulatory definition of a serious
adverse experience [35]. Enhanced surveillance processing
activities enabling collection of additional medical records
for certain products, product classes or adverse events
without regard to the regulatory definition may introduce
measurement bias through differential coding practices.
Finally, MedDRAÒ hierarchy constraints may preclude
identification of a common underlying pathophysiological
process or components thereof. For example, a product
might be associated with thrombosis, yet data mining
EB05s for deep venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolism
might not exceed 2.0.
Data mining analysis plans have been integrated into
surveillance activities for all CBER-regulated vaccines. As
our data mining capabilities evolve, we hope to have more
precise and robust search strategies that can improve
specificity and answer specialized questions. Our evaluation of febrile seizures could have been enhanced if we
were able to define more appropriate age strata (e.g., a 6- to
24-month-old stratum, in which a large majority of febrile
seizures occurred). Ongoing work will provide this capability in the near future. Furthermore, we could benefit
from the ability to adjust analyses for symptom-onset
interval (e.g., minimizing potential confounding from a

Data Mining for Detection of Signals in VAERS

concomitantly administered measles-mumps-rubella-varicella vaccine known to also have an association with
febrile seizures at a longer onset interval). Ideally, data
mining could one day reliably enable further important
ad hoc subset analyses using other data fields from the
VAERS form to better characterize potential signals.
Potential limitations notwithstanding, routine automated
data mining can be an important hypothesis-generating tool
that has demonstrated the capacity to enable the rapid
detection of signals that might otherwise be missed by
other pharmacovigilance practices. This case study
describing the identification of a novel signal for febrile
seizures after an influenza vaccine illustrates that Bayesian
data mining can be used to detect a vaccine-adverse event
signal as well as an age-specific signal for a given vaccine.
