Abstract
Objective: Adverse event reports (AERs) submitted to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) were reviewed to assess
the muscular and renal adverse events induced by the administration of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMGCoA) reductase inhibitors (statins) and to attempt to determine the rank-order of the association.
Methods: After a revision of arbitrary drug names and the deletion of duplicated submissions, AERs involving pravastatin,
simvastatin, atorvastatin, or rosuvastatin were analyzed. Authorized pharmacovigilance tools were used for quantitative
detection of signals, i.e., drug-associated adverse events, including the proportional reporting ratio, the reporting odds ratio,
the information component given by a Bayesian confidence propagation neural network, and the empirical Bayes
geometric mean. Myalgia, rhabdomyolysis and an increase in creatine phosphokinase level were focused on as the muscular
adverse events, and acute renal failure, non-acute renal failure, and an increase in blood creatinine level as the renal adverse
events.
Results: Based on 1,644,220 AERs from 2004 to 2009, signals were detected for 4 statins with respect to myalgia,
rhabdomyolysis, and an increase in creatine phosphokinase level, but these signals were stronger for rosuvastatin than
pravastatin and atorvastatin. Signals were also detected for acute renal failure, though in the case of atorvastatin, the
association was marginal, and furthermore, a signal was not detected for non-acute renal failure or for an increase in blood
creatinine level.
Conclusions: Data mining of the FDA’s adverse event reporting system, AERS, is useful for examining statin-associated
muscular and renal adverse events. The data strongly suggest the necessity of well-organized clinical studies with respect to
statin-associated adverse events.

potent statin, cerivastatin, from the global market have posed a
variety of problems concerning pharmacovigilance [15,16].
In 2005 and 2006, two post-marketing analyses were published
[17,18], in which the safety of statins was assessed using adverse
event reports (AERs) submitted to the US Food and Drug
Administration (FDA). This database relies on reports of
spontaneous adverse events to the FDA generated by health
professionals, consumers, and manufacturers, and the system is
referred to as the Adverse Event Reporting System (AERS).
Despite the small number of AERs at that time, the reports
provided information valuable for clinical decisions, because it was
user-derived. Continuous operation of the AERS thereafter has
resulted in an enormous database, and in this study, about 2
million AERs submitted to the AERS from 2004 to 2009 were
reviewed to assess the muscular and renal adverse events induced
by the administration of statins and to attempt to determine their

Introduction
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) involves a wide range of
disorders, such as ischemic heart disease, heart attack and stroke,
and a high level of LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) in blood is a risk
factor for CVD [1–5]. Given that a reduction in LDL-C results in
the prevention of CVD, the inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase (statins) are currently
used for the primary and secondary prevention of CVD [1–5].
Recently, it has been suggested that a more intensive lowering of
LDL-C could achieve better clinical benefits, and rosuvastatin has
attracted attention [6,7]. However in 2003, controversial concerns
were raised about its safety in a respected international journal, in
terms of rhabdomyolysis and renal failure, on the basis of
premarketing studies and post-marketing reports [8–14]. The
continuous debate about rosuvastatin, and withdrawal of another

[21], and the empirical Bayes geometric mean (EBGM) [22] are
widely used, and indeed, the PRR is currently employed by the
Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA),
UK, the ROR by the Netherlands Pharmacovigilance Centre, the
In by the World Health Organization (WHO), and the EBGM by
the FDA.
All of these algorithms extract decision rules for signal detection
and/or calculate scores to measure the associations between drugs
and adverse events from a two-by-two frequency table of counts
that involve the presence or absence of a particular drug and a
particular event occurring in case reports. These algorithms,
however, differ from one another in that the PRR and ROR are
frequentist (non-Bayesian), whereas the IC and EBGM are
Bayesian. In this section, only the scoring thresholds used in the
present study are given, and the reader is referred to review articles
for more extensive details of each statistical test [23–25].
Here, we define how a drug and associated adverse event is
classified as a signal when using each statistical test. Using the PRR, a
signal is detected, if the count of co-occurrences $3 and the
PRR$2.0 with an associated x2 value$4.0 [19]. For the ROR, a
signal is detected, if the lower bound of the 95% two-sided confidence
interval exceeds 1 [20]. Signal detection using the IC is done using the
IC025 metric, a criterion indicating the lower bound of the 95% twosided confidence interval of the IC, and a signal is detected with the
IC025 value exceeds 0 [21]. Finally, the EB05 metric, a lower onesided 95% confidence limit of EBGM, is used and a signal is detected
when EB05 is greater than or equal to the threshold value 2.0 [22]. In
this study, the adverse events were extracted when at least 1 of 4
indices met the criteria indicated above.

rank-order of the association. To evaluate the results statistically,
authorized pharmacovigilance methods were used for quantitative
signal detection [19–25], where a signal means a drug-associated
adverse event. Here, the AERs with pravastatin, fluvastatin,
lovastatin, simvastatin, atorvastatin, and rosuvastatin were analyzed, and myalgia, rhabdomyolysis and an increase in creatine
phosphokinase level were focused on as the muscular adverse
events, and acute renal failure, non-acute renal failure, and an
increase in blood creatinine level as the renal adverse events.

Methods
Data sources
Input data for this study were taken from the public release of
the FDA’s AERS database, which covers the period from the first
quarter of 2004 through the end of 2009. The data structure of
AERS is in compliance with international safety reporting
guidance, ICH E2B, consisting of 7 data sets; patient demographic
and administrative information (DEMO), drug/biologic information (DRUG), adverse events (REAC), patient outcomes (OUTC),
report sources (RPSR), drug therapy start and end dates (THER),
and indications for use/diagnosis (INDI). The adverse events in
REAC are coded using preferred terms (PTs) in the Medical
Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) terminology.
Here, version 13.0 of MedDRA was used.
Prior to analysis, all drug names were unified into generic names
by a text-mining approach, because AERS permits the registering
of arbitrary drug names, including trade names and abbreviations.
Spelling errors were detected by GNU Aspell and carefully confirmed by working pharmacists. Foods, beverages, treatments (e.g.
X-ray radiation), and unspecified names (e.g., beta-blockers) were
omitted for this study. Duplicated reports were deleted according
to FDA’s recommendation of adopting the most recent CASE
number (as described in one of the downloaded files, ‘Asc_nts.doc’
from the web-site of the FDA AERS database), resulting in the
reduction of the number of AERs from 2,231,029 to 1,644,220.
The total number of co-occurrences, i.e., drug-adverse event pairs,
was 22,017,956.

Results
The total number of co-occurrences with pravastatin was 53,317,
and 16,527 for fluvastatin, 21,345 for lovastatin, 180,042 for
simvastatin, 220,194 for atorvastatin, and 57,389 for rosuvastatin,
representing 0.242%, 0.075%, 0.097%, 0.818%, 1.000% and
0.260% of all co-occurrences in the database, respectively. In total,
701, 628, 490, 744, 883 and 619 adverse events were extracted as
statin-associated adverse events with 17,815, 5,469, 8,345, 82,028,
100,133, and 30,356 co-occurrences, respectively. The total number
of adverse events occurring with fluvastatin and lovastatin was not
large enough to compare the association with adverse events.
The signals for myalgia, rhabdomyolysis, and an increase in
creatine phosphokinase level were detected for pravastatin,
simvastatin, atorvastatin, and rosuvastatin. The statistical data are
listed in Table 1. Although the signals were detected for these
statins, the association with myalgia was noteworthy for rosuvastatin. As for rhabdomyolysis and the increase in creatine
phosphokinase level, statistical indices indicated a stronger association for simvastatin and rosuvastatin. Other muscular adverse
events found commonly for these four statins included asthenia,
chest pain, pain in the extremities, muscle spasms, muscular
weakness, myositis, and myopathy, and a stronger association was
found for rosuvastatin (statistical data not shown).
The data concerning acute renal failure, non-acute renal failure,
and an increase in blood creatinine level are listed in Table 2.
Acute renal failure was associated with all 4 statins, though in the
case of atorvastatin, the association was marginal, and furthermore, a signal was not detected for non-acute renal failure or for
an increase in blood creatinine level.

Definition of adverse events
As the muscular adverse events, myalgia, rhabdomyolysis and an
increase in creatine phosphokinase level were focused herein, and
these events are coded by preferred terms (PTs) as PT10028411,
PT10039020, and PT10005470, respectively, by MedDRA version
13.0, in which 18, 2 and 12 lower level of terms (LLTs) are assigned,
respectively. For example, muscle pain (LLT10028322) and tenderness muscle (LLT10043230) are included in myalgia (PT10028411).
Additionally, statin-associated asthenia (PT10003549, 22 LLTs), chest
pain (PT10008479, 38 LLTs), pain in the extremities (PT10033425,
39 LLTs), muscle spasms (PT10028334, 38 LLTs), muscular
weakness (PT10028372, 23 LLTs), myositis (PT10028653, 7 LLTs),
and myopathy (PT10028641, 12 LLTs) were analyzed. As for the
renal adverse events, acute renal failure (PT10038436, 28 LLTs), nonacute renal failure (PT10038435, 12 LLTs), and an increase in blood
creatinine level (PT10005483, 9 LLTs) were focused.

Data mining
In pharmacovigilance analyses, data mining algorithms have
been developed to identify drug-associated adverse events as
signals that are reported more frequently than expected by
estimating expected reporting frequencies on the basis of
information on all drugs and all events in the database [23–25].
For example, the proportional reporting ratio (PRR) [19], the
reporting odds ratio (ROR) [20], the information component (IC)

elevation in creatine phosphokinase level, the condition is known
as myositis [4], but myositis does not always require such
conditions [27]. The severe case is understood to be rhabdomyolysis [4,27].
Golomb et al. pointed out the importance of physician response
to patient reports of statin-associated adverse events [29]. Using a
patient-targeted survey, they indicated that 87% of patients
reportedly spoke to their physicians about the possible connection
between statin use and symptoms, but physicians were more likely
to deny than affirm the possibility [29]. The AERS database
covers several million case reports on adverse events, and is characterized by spontaneity. Pharmacovigilance aims to search for
previously unknown patterns and automatically detect important

emic patients receiving high doses of statins, indicated that the
symptoms were reported by 10.5% of patients [3,26]. In a recently
published review, it was suggested that the muscular symptoms
occurred in up to 20% of patients in observational studies [27],
and Dirks and Jones indicated that as many as 25% of statin users
who exercise may experience muscular symptoms [28]. The
prevalence varied among the reports, and this can be explained, in
part, by ambiguity in the terms [4]. The National Lipids
Association’s Muscle Expert Panel and other statin experts have
emphasized the importance of standardizing terms in order to
allow reliable comparisons among studies and to improve care for
statin users [4]. Generally, myopathy or myalgia is the term to
describe all muscular symptoms [4,27]. If it is accompanied by

Statin-Associated Adverse Events

[31], CARDS [32] and ALLIANCE [33], in which atorvastatin
was found to improve renal function.
There is no credible counterfactual, e.g., randomized control
group, to extract the drug-associated adverse events as signals, and
therefore the disease-oriented adverse events can be extracted as
signals. For example, myalgia was extracted as a statin-associated
adverse event for pravastatin, simvastatin, atorvastatin, and rosuvastatin, but this adverse event might also be commonly found in
hyperlipidemic patients irrespective of administration of statins. It
is noted that the results can be biased by unmeasured confounding
factors. Although the comparison among statins possibly offsets
them, a statistically well-organized methodology should be established to minimize their effects.
Advanced age and female sex are risk factors for statinassociated adverse events [27,34–36]. The DEMO file of AERS
data includes patient demographic and administrative information. Age data was valuable for 1,084,999 (66.0%) of 1,644,220
AERs; the average (6SD) was 52.7623.2 years. The gender was
clarified in 1,520,994 AERs (92.5%), and the ratio was male/
female/unknown = 605,271/915,723/123,226 (36.8%/55.7%/
7.5%). There were no statistically significant differences of age
and gender among statins. Again, there was no rational method to
elucidate the risk factors for drug-associated adverse events, and
additional tools should be established to exploit the data herein.
In conclusion, AERs submitted to the FDA were reviewed to
assess the statin-associated muscular and renal adverse events and
to attempt to determine the rank-order of the association. Based
on 1,644,220 AERs from 2004 to 2009, it was suggested that the
adverse events, including myalgia, rhabdomyolysis, an increase in
creatine phosphokinase level and other muscular events, were
associated with pravastatin, simvastatin, atorvastatin, and rosuvastatin and these events were more noteworthy for rosuvastatin
than pravastatin and atorvastatin. Acute renal failure was also
associated with 4 statins, but the association was marginal for
atorvastatin. These data strongly suggest the necessity of wellorganized clinical studies with respect to statin-associated adverse
events.

signals, i.e., drug-associated adverse events, from such a large
database. Recently developed data mining tools, i.e., the PRR,
ROR, IC, and EBGM, have been successful at detecting signals
that could not be found by individual case reviews and that warrant
further investigation together with continuous surveillance. These
tools are now used routinely for pharmacovigilance, supporting
signal detection and decision-making at companies, regulatory
agencies, and pharmacovigilance centers [19–25]. Comparisons of
specificity have showed that none of these indices is universally
better than the others [20,23,24].
The AERS database is considered a valuable tool; however,
some limitations inherent to spontaneous reporting have been
pointed out [23]. First, the data occasionally contain misspelling
and miswords, although the structure of AERS is in compliance
with the international safety reporting guidance. Second, the
system was started more than 10 years ago, and reporting patterns
have changed over time. Third, the adverse events are coded using
hierarchical terms of PTs of MedDRA, and changes in terminology over time also might affect the quality of the database.
Last, there are a number of duplicate entries in the database. To
overcome problems with data quality, we manually corrected
mistakes in the data entities and deleted duplicates according to
FDA’s recommended method.
Here, it was suggested that the muscular adverse events were
associated with pravastatin, simvastatin, atorvastatin, and rosuvastatin, including myalgia, rhabdomyolysis, an increase in
creatine phosphokinase level, asthenia, chest pain, pain in
extremities, muscle spasms, muscular weakness, myositis and
myopathy. Additionally, according to the PRR, ROR, IC and
EBGM values, these muscular adverse events were more
noteworthy for rosuvastatin than pravastatin and atorvastatin.
This was not correlated with the rank-order of inhibitory activity
of HMG-CoA reductase, suggesting that these adverse events
were, in part, independent of cholesterol metabolic pathways.
These data strongly suggest the necessity of randomized controlled
clinical studies or observation cohort studies with respect to statinassociated muscular adverse events. Also, acute renal failure was
associated with 4 statins, but the association was marginal for
atorvastatin. It should be noted that no signals were detected for
atorvastatin-associated non-acute renal failure and an increase in
blood creatinine level. These results are not contradictory to the
findings of the large-scale clinical studies GREACE [30], TNT
