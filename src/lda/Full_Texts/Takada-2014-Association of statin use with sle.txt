Abstract
Background Particular interest has been generated
regarding the possible influence of statin use on sleep
quality. However, no conclusive evidence exists that a
particular statin is more likely to be associated with sleep
disturbances versus others. It remains uncertain whether
different statins produce different risks for sleep
disturbance.
Objective To examine the association between statin use
and the risk of sleep disturbances, we conducted data
mining using the US Food and Drug Administration
Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) and a large
organized database of prescriptions constructed by a database vendor (Japan Medical Information Research Institute, Inc. Japan).
Methods Relevant reports in the FAERS were identified
and analyzed. Data from the first quarter of 2004 through
the end of 2013 were included in this study. The reporting
odds ratio (ROR) was used to detect spontaneous report
signals, calculated using the case/non-case method. For the
ROR, a signal was detected if the lower limit of 95 % twosided confidence interval (95 % CI) was [1. Additionally,
signal detection using the IC was conducted using the
IC025 metric, a lower limit of the 95 % CI of the IC, where

a signal is detected if the IC025 value exceeds 0. In
addition, symmetry analysis was used to identify the risk of
insomnia after using statins over the period of January
2006 to August 2013.
Results In the analyses of the FAERS database, significant signals for sleep disturbances including disturbances
in initiating and maintaining sleep, sleep disorders NEC,
sleeping disorders due to a general medical condition, and
parasomnias were found. In the prescription sequence
symmetry analysis, a significant association between statin
use and hypnotic drug use was found, with adjusted
sequence ratios of 1.14 (1.03–1.26), 1.20 (1.11–1.29), and
1.18 (1.11–1.25) at intervals of 91, 182, and 365 days,
respectively.
Conclusion Multi-methodological approaches using different algorithms and databases strongly suggest that statin
use is associated with an increased risk for sleep disturbances including insomnia.

1 Background
HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) are effective and
widely used drugs in patients with hypercholesterolemia,
and the efficacy and safety of statins have been studied in a
number of large trials of long duration [1, 2]. From a safety
perspective, both clinical trials and post-marketing surveillance have demonstrated that statins are generally well
tolerated, with rare but severe adverse effects that mainly
affect the muscle, liver, and kidney [1]. These trials have
shown that medically significant adverse effects are
uncommon. Although the safety profile of statins is well
documented and the majority of people treated with statins
enjoy good outcomes, no drug is without the potential for
adverse effects. The most recognized and commonly
reported adverse statin-related events pertains to muscle
complications, including pain, fatigue, and weakness, in
addition to rhabdomyolysis [3–6].
In recent years, interest has been focused on the
potential risk of adverse psychiatric reactions to statins,
including memory loss, depression, suicidality, aggression,
and antisocial behavior [7–10]. Particular interest has been
also raised about the possible influence of statin treatment
on sleep quality. However, several studies focused on
possible statin-induced insomnia and sleep alterations have
generated conflicting or non-conclusive results.
A Europe-wide review conducted by the Medicine and
Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) assessed
the evidence available on the following adverse drug
reactions (ADRs) associated with the use of statins (atorvastatin, fluvastatin, lovastatin, pravastatin, rosuvastatin,
and simvastatin): sleep disturbances, memory loss, micturition disorders (problems with urination), sexual disturbances, depression, and interstitial pneumopathy [11]. The
evidence assessed included data from clinical trials, postmarketing reported cases of ADRs, and the published literature. This report concluded that it seemed practical to
include core safety information for sleep disturbances in
the Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC) for all
statins. However, it remains uncertain whether different
statins produce different risks for sleep disturbance. A
further clarification of the data related to statin-induced
sleep disturbances should be presented to improve safe use
in clinical practice.
Recently, data mining with different methodologies and
algorithms has been applied to identify safety signals
within medical databases, including spontaneous ADR
databases, claims databases, and prescription databases.
We examined the association of statin use and sleep disturbances using the US Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS), which
is a large and useful spontaneous database of adverse event
reports. In addition, a large and well organized database of

M. Takada et al.

prescriptions constructed by a database vendor (Japan
Medical Information Research Institute, Inc. Japan
[JMIRI]) was also analyzed. The aim of our study was to
examine the hypothesis that sleep disturbances are associated with the use of statins by employing different methodologies, algorithms, and databases.

2 Methods
2.1 FAERS Data Mining
2.1.1 Data Sources
The FAERS is a computerized information database
designed to support the FDA’s post-marketing safety surveillance program for all approved drugs and therapeutic
biological products. The system contains all reports of
adverse events reported spontaneously by healthcare professionals, manufacturers, and consumers worldwide. The
FAERS consists of seven data sets that include patient
demographic and administrative information (file descriptor
DEMO), drug and biologic information (DRUG), adverse
events (REAC), patient outcomes (OUTC), report sources
(RPSR), start of drug therapy and end dates (THER), and
indications for use/diagnosis (INDI). A unique number for
identifying a FAERS report allows all the information from
different files to be linked. Raw data from the FAERS
database can be downloaded freely from the FDA website
(http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/InformationOnDrugs/ucm1351
51.htm). Data from the first quarter of 2004 through the end
of 2013 were included in this study. A total of 4,052,885
reports were obtained. Reports with a common CASE
number were identified as duplicated reports. We deleted
duplicates and excluded from the analyses. Finally, a total
of 54,841,322 drug-reaction pairs were identified in
3,308,116 reports. The Medical Dictionary for Regulatory
Activities (MedDRAÒ version 17.0) preferred terms (PTs)
was used to classify the adverse events. The structure of the
FAERS database is described elsewhere [12].
The FAERS data have some limitations. First, there is no
certainty that the reported event (adverse event or medication
error) was actually due to the drug. Second, the FDA does not
receive reports on every adverse event or medication error
that occurs with a product [13, 14]. Therefore, the FAERS
data cannot be used to calculate the incidence of an adverse
event or medication error in the population. However, FAERS data could be used for signal detection [15, 16].
2.1.2 Identifying Statins
FAERS permits the registration of arbitrary drug names
including trade names, generic names, and abbreviations.

MedDRAÒ Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities with version 17.0

All drug names were extracted from the DRUG file of
FAERS and recorded. A drug name archive that included
the names of all preparations, generic names, and synonyms of drugs marketed in the world was created using
the Martindale website (https://www.medicinescomplete.
com/mc/login.htm). Simvastatin, rosuvastatin, pravastatin,
atorvastatin, fluvastatin, lovastatin, and pitavastatin were
identified by linking this archive with the FAERS database.
All records including statins in the DRUG files were
selected and the relevant reactions from the REACTION
files were then identified.
2.1.3 Definition of Adverse Events
Adverse events in the FAERS database are coded using the
PTs in the MedDRAÒ terminology.1 The MedDRAÒ
includes groupings of PTs that relate to defined medical
conditions or areas of interest. Sleep disorders and disturbances related to the high level terms and PTs used in the
study were listed in Table 1.

MedDRAÒ, the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities
terminology, is the international medical terminology developed
under the auspices of the International Conference on Harmonization
of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for
Human Use (ICH). The MedDRAÒ trademark is owned by the
International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Associations (IFPMA) on behalf of the ICH.

2.1.4 Data Mining
The reporting odds ratio (ROR) [17], and the information
component (IC) [18] were used to detect spontaneous
report signals. These signal scores were calculated using a
case/non-case method [19, 20]. Cases are the reports with
the event of interest (i.e., sleep disturbance), and the noncases are all the other reports. ROR and IC are widely used
and employed by the Netherlands Pharmacovigilance
Centre and the World Health Organization (WHO),
respectively [17, 18].
All of these algorithms were used to calculate signal
scores to assess whether a drug was significantly associated
with an adverse event or not from a two-by-two frequency
table of counts. However, these calculations or algorithms,
so-called disproportionality analyses or measures, differ
from one another in that the ROR is frequentist (nonBayesian), whereas the IC is Bayesian. For the ROR, a
signal is detected if the lower limit of 95 % two-sided
confidence interval (95 % CI) is [1 [17]. Signal detection
using the IC is conducted using the IC025 metric, a lower
limit of the 95 % CI of the IC, and a signal is detected if
the IC025 value exceeds 0 [18]. In the current study, two
methods were used to detect signals, and the adverse events
were listed as drug associated when two indices met the
criteria indicated above. Data management and analyses
were performed using Visual Mining Studio software
(version 7.3; Mathematical Systems, Inc., Tokyo, Japan).

2.2 Prescription Sequence Symmetry Analysis
2.2.1 Data Source
A large organized database of prescriptions constructed by
a database vendor (JMIRI) was used in the study. The
JMIRI prescription database consisted of prescriptions
collected from approximately 400 pharmacies in Japan.
The database included approximately 69,000,000 prescriptions for about 7,230,000 patients from January 2006
to August 2013. For the prescription sequence symmetry
analysis, we identified cases extracted from the JMIRI
prescription database in which statins or drugs for sleep
disturbance were prescribed at least once during the study
period. The data included an encrypted personal identifier:
month/year of birth and gender of the patient, drug name,
unique drug code and generic name, and prescribing date.
Data on drugs dispensed in hospitals were not included.
This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Kinki
University School of Pharmacy.
2.2.2 Study Design
The prescription sequence symmetry analysis (PSSA) was
performed to test the hypothesis that statins increase the risk
for insomnia. The PSSA method has been described in
detail in several published studies, which have investigated
the associations between the use of certain target drugs and
potential adverse events [21, 22]. Briefly, the PSSA evaluates asymmetry in the distribution of an incident event (e.g.,
prescription of another drug) before and after the initiation
of a specific treatment. Asymmetry may indicate an association of the specific treatment of interest with the event.
The PSSA is based on a situation when drug A is suspected
of causing an adverse event that itself is treated by drug B
[21]. In this study, hypnotic drugs were used as markers of
insomnia caused by statins, and the association between
statin use and the use of hypnotic drugs was analyzed.
The ratio of the number of patients with a prescription for
hypnotic drugs after the initiation of statins versus the number
of patients with the event before the initiation of statins was
defined as the crude sequence ratio (SR). A SR [1 indicated
an increased risk for statin-induced insomnia. The SR is
sensitive to prescribing trends over time. Therefore, the SRs
were adjusted for temporal trends in statins and hypnotic
drugs using the method proposed by Halls [21]. The probability for statins to be prescribed first, in the absence of any
causal relationship, can be estimated by the so-called nulleffect SR [21]. The null-effect SR produced by the proposed
model may be interpreted as a reference value for the SR.
Therefore, the null-effect SR is the expected SR in the
absence of any causal association, after taking the incidence
trends into account. By dividing the crude SR by the null-

M. Takada et al.

effect SR, an adjusted SR (ASR) can be obtained that is
corrected for temporal trends. A slightly modified model was
used to account for the limited time interval allowed between
statins and treatment for insomnia [22]. The major advantage
of the SR is that it is robust for confounders that are stable over
time. Significant confounding factors, including age, gender,
and frequency of visits did not cause an asymmetrical distribution of the statins and hypnotic drugs [22].
2.2.3 Data Analysis
The PSSA was undertaken to identify the new use of hypnotic drugs listed in Table 2 as a surrogate for statininduced insomnia. All incident users of statins and hypnotic
drugs were identified during the period from January 2006
to August 2013. For this study, patients included in the
database were followed up to August 2013 and therefore
different patients had different follow-up periods. Incidence
was defined as the first prescription for target drugs. To
exclude prevalent users of target drugs, the analysis was
restricted to users who presented their first prescription on
July 2006 or later, that is, after a run-in period of 6 months.
To ensure that our analysis was restricted to incident users,
we also did a waiting time distribution analysis [23]. An
identical run-in period was also applicable to patients
enrolled into the cohort after July 2006 to exclude the
prevalent use of target drugs. The analysis was based on the
principle that by observing the first occurrence of a prescription within a specific time window, prevalent users of
the drug will cluster at the beginning of the observation
period when the prescription is repeated within a short time
period. In contrast, incident users will be distributed evenly
throughout the observation period. Incident users were
identified by excluding those patients who had received
their first prescription for the target drugs prior to June
2006. All patients were identified who initiated a new
treatment with statins and hypnotic drugs within 91-, 182-,
and 365-day periods. Patients who had received their first
prescriptions for statins and hypnotic drugs on the same date
were not included in the determination of SR.
Results are expressed as the means ± standard deviation (SD) for quantitative data and as frequencies (percentage) for categorical data. Ninety-five percent CI for the
ASRs were calculated using a method for exact CIs for
binomial distributions [24].

4 Discussion

Haloxazolam

Analyses of the FAERS database and the JMIRI prescription database suggested that statin use was associated with
developing sleep disturbances including insomnia. In the
present study, significant signals for disturbances in initiating and maintaining sleep were found for the whole class
of statins in the analysis of the FAERS database, and a
significant association was found between statin use and
hypnotic drug use in the analysis of the JMIRI prescription
database. Consistent findings from the independent analyses, using different methodologies, algorithms, and databases strongly suggest that statin use is associated with the
development of insomnia. The MHRA Public Assessment
Report evaluated the association of statin use with sleep
disturbances [11]. Although the SPC for pravastatin lists
sleep disturbances, the MHRA Public Assessment Report
concluded that it was necessary to list sleep disturbance in
the SPC for the remaining statins. Given these considerations, it is reasonable to assume that all statins increase the
risk for sleep disturbances including insomnia.
The specific rate of psychiatric adverse events associated with different statins is probably related to the ability
of each drug to cross the blood-brain barrier [25, 26]. Thus,
it is hypothesized that statins with a high degree of lipophilicity might be associated with a higher rate of central
nervous system disturbances in comparison with hydrophilic statins [27]. In fact, the majority of available reports
have referred to lipophilic statins, namely simvastatin and
lovastatin [28–30]. However, no conclusive evidence exists
that a particular statin is more likely to be associated with
sleep disturbances over others.
With regard to insomnia, there are a number of reports
concerning its association with statin use. Schaefer

atorvastatin, 1,258 for pitavastatin, 3,417 for fluvastatin,
and 4,196 for lovastatin. The total number of drug-reaction
pairs for statins was 1,433,826 including 487,237 for
simvastatin, 177,763 for rosuvastatin, 122,768 for pravastatin, 556,579 for atorvastatin, 5,424 for pitavastatin,
28,010 for fluvastatin, and 56,045 for lovastatin. The
number of drug-reaction pairs was 269,084 for disturbances in initiating and maintaining sleep, 51,463 for sleep
disorders NEC, 263,872 for dyssomnias, 2,210 for sleep
disorders due to a general medical condition, 98 for sleep
disorders related to another mental condition, 2,088 for
sleep-phase rhythm disturbances, 76,936 for parasomnias,
and 4,088 for narcolepsy and associated conditions.
The statistical data on statin-associated sleep disturbances are presented in Table 3. The signal scores suggested that the statins were associated with sleep
disturbances including disturbances in initiating and
maintaining sleep, sleep disorders NEC, sleeping disorders
due to a general medical condition, and parasomnias. In the
analysis of individual statins, simvastatin showed significant signals for disturbances in initiating and maintaining
sleep, sleep disorders NEC, dyssomnia and parasomnias,
rosuvastatin for disturbances in initiating and maintaining
sleep, sleep disorders NEC, sleep disorders due to general
medical condition and parasomnias, pravastatin for sleep
disorders NEC, fluvastatin for sleep disorders NEC, and
lovastatin for disturbances in initiating and maintaining
sleep and parasomnias. Atorvastatin and pitavastatin did
not show a significant signal for sleep disturbances.

reported that a higher prevalence of sleep complaints was
observed in patients receiving lovastatin than in patients
receiving pravastatin, which is a predominant hydrophilic
statin [31]. Vgontzas et al. [32] found that prolonged
administration of lovastatin, but not pravastatin, increased
the wake time after sleep onset in controlled studies comparing the effects of lovastatin and pravastatin on sleep. In
addition, decreased sleep time was observed after administration of simvastatin to patients who had not previously
complained of sleep problems [33], and our present analysis of the FAERS database also showed that simvastatin
showed an increased ROR for disturbances in initiating and
maintaining sleep. These studies and our finding may
support the notion that lipophilic statins are more likely to
be associated with psychiatric ADRs; however, several
conflicting findings have also been reported. Tuccori et al.
[25] found a significant association between insomnia and
statins as a whole class, but did not find a relationship for

on sleep parameters in hypercholesterolaemic patients [34].
In the present PSSA using the JMIRI prescription database,
a significant association of hypnotic drug use was found
with the whole class of statins but not with individual
statins. In the present study using the FAERS database,
significant signals for disturbances in initiating and maintaining sleep were found for the whole class of statins;
however, in the analysis of individual statins, significant
signals for disturbances in initiating and maintaining sleep
were found for simvastatin, rosuvastatin, and lovastatin,
but not for the other statins. Additionally, it has been
reported that switching to a different statin was able to
resolve symptoms in some cases, but in other cases,
switching to a different statin was not able to resolve
symptoms [35]. These findings may suggest that individual
statins are associated with different degrees of risk for
psychiatric adverse events and also may not support the
hypothesis that hydrophilic statins are safer than lipophilic
statins in the production of sleep disturbances including
insomnia. However, in the present analysis of some stains,

sample sizes are too small to allow the identification of
weak signals. Although significant signals of sleep disturbances were not found in some analyses in the present
study, this may be mainly attributable to a limited sample
size and insufficient power to detect small risks. In addition, many factors may contribute to the development of
sleep disturbances including insomnia. In the present study,
individual cases were not reviewed and the causes other
than statin use were not considered. This is a significant
limitation in our study. Consequently, it is reasonable that
the whole class of statins produces an increased risk for
sleep disturbances including insomnia; however, individual
statins may have a different degree of risk for sleep disturbances. To ensure that our findings are reliable, a
number of confounding factors associated with the development of sleep disturbances including insomnia should be
investigated in future studies.
Although a plausible pharmacological mechanism for
sleep disturbance is unknown, several theories have been
reported. Reduced serum cholesterol levels might decrease

Statin Use and Sleep Disturbances

brain cell membrane cholesterol, lower lipid microviscosity, and decrease the expression of serotonin receptors on
the membrane surface; this would lead ultimately to a
reduction in the control of serotonin on neuronal activity
[36]. As central serotonergic pathways are involved in
behavioral control, reduced cholesterol levels could facilitate the occurrence of adverse psychiatric events. If this
mechanism is correct, the degree of lipophilicity for statins
would not primarily affect the development of sleep disturbances. Tuccori et al. also proposed seven mechanisms
to explain the neuropsychiatric effects of statins, which are
not mutually exclusive and are related mainly to inhibition
of HMG-CoA reductase. At the present time, it is unclear
whether statins with a high degree of lipophilicity might be
associated with a higher rate of insomnia in comparison
with hydrophilic statins. Further study is required to define
the pharmacological mechanisms underlying sleep
disturbances.
The present study detected reliable but weak signals for
sleep disturbances including insomnia in statin users.
Chronic insufficient sleep or sleep loss, which might be
attributed to insufficient sleep duration, insomnia, and
irregular sleep-wake schedules, is a common problem in
humans in industrial societies. Symptoms of insomnia are a
common complaint among community residents and primary care patients. Liu et al. [37] reported that the prevalence rate for insomnia in the general adult population of
Japan was 21 %, while 6 % took sleep-enhancing medications. The prevalence of self-reported sleep difficulty is
in the range of 10–40 % [38–42]. Problems with sleep are a
common event in elderly patients [37, 43], and statinrelated insomnia may go unnoticed or missed in clinical
practice. Therefore, it may not be easy to find an association between symptoms related to sleep disturbances and
drug therapy.
The analysis of spontaneous reports is a useful method
for identifying signals, and the FAERS database is considered the largest source of these data. However, there are
several potential limitations that should be taken into
account when interpreting results obtained from the FAERS database [44]. First, the database has missing data and
also frequent misspelling of drug names. Second, there are
a number of duplicate entries in the database. To overcome
problems with data quality, we manually corrected mistakes in the data entries and deleted duplicates. Third,
slightly increased ROR and IC values do not imply an
unmistakable risk of sleep disturbance in clinical practice.
These data mining algorithms and criteria were assessed
from the standpoint of early and timely signal detection
when used for pharmacovigilance [45–47]. These quantitative pharmacovigilance methods and criteria may also be
helpful in providing further information on the known
adverse event, and many studies in this area have been

429

reported [48–52]. However, no individual algorithm to
detect signals is adequate and the concurrent use of other
algorithm is essential. Therefore, the ROR and IC algorithms were used in the analysis of the FAERS database,
and our study detected weak but reliable signals for sleep
disturbances. Furthermore, in the current study, a different
methodology, the PSSA of the JMIRI prescription database, was used to confirm the findings of FAERS database
analyses, and produced consistent findings. Of course, the
PSSA is associated with several potential limitations
because of its use of a prescription database from pharmacies. First, data for drugs dispensed in hospitals were not
included. Second, drugs approved for use against insomnia
were used as surrogate markers for insomnia. Therefore,
some patients may not in fact have had insomnia. Third,
other causes of insomnia were not considered in interpreting the results. Insomnia may be attributed to various
causes including depression, stress, and anxiety associated
with cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events and treatment. Additionally, it is known that statin-treated patients
have an increased risk of depression. In the present study,
individual cases were not reviewed, and other causes were
not considered. This is a significant limitation in the study.
Finally, the relatively short intervals (91, 182, and 365
days) were used to identify the association between statin
use and hypnotic drug use. The PSSA has a lower sensitivity when the time between statin initiation and the
event is restricted to a short interval [53]. This low sensitivity is possibly because of the small sample sizes and
an inadequate time window frame particularly for adverse
events that may take longer to manifest [53]. When a long
interval is used, potential time-varying covariates would
make it difficult to determine the causality of exposure
and outcome [54]. Tuccori et al. [35] reported that the
median time for overall psychiatric events since the first
statin administration was 41 days (range 4–420 days) in
45 cases reported in the period 1992–2012. Taking into
account these findings, the relatively short intervals were
used.
In the analysis of the FAERS database, significant signals for disturbances in initiating and maintaining sleep,
sleep disorders NEC, dyssomnias, and parasomnias were
found. The ROR measure found the significant signal for
fluvastatin-sleep phase rhythm disturbances combination,
but the IC measure did not found this signal. Therefore, we
decided that the fluvastatin-sleep phase rhythm disturbances combination was not significant. This may be
mainly attributable to limited sample sizes and insufficient
power to detect small risks. Statins may produce a wide
variety of psychiatric adverse events. Among these sleep
disturbances, insomnia was the most frequently occurring
adverse event, and therefore close monitoring is required to
prevent this adverse event in clinical practice.

5 Conclusions
Multi-methodological approaches using different methodologies, algorithms, and databases strongly suggest that
statin use is associated with an increased risk for sleep
disturbances including insomnia. Although it is proposed
that statins with a high degree of lipophilicity might be
associated with a higher rate of central nervous system
disturbances in comparison with hydrophilic statins, we
could not obtain clear evidence that hydrophilic statins
produce a low degree of insomnia risk. Additionally, analysis of the FAERS database detected significant signals for
sleep disturbances other than insomnia in statin users.
Therefore, people prescribed statins should be considered
as having an increased risk of sleep disturbance. Although
the biological mechanism for this phenomenon remains
unknown, the risk of sleep disturbance associated with
statin use is a very important finding in clinical practice.
Sleep disturbances associated with statins should be closely
monitored in clinical practice, and further studies are
needed to confirm our findings and elucidate the mechanism for statin-induced sleep disturbance.
