Reactions Using the Japanese Adverse Drug Event
Report Database

Severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs), such as Stevens–Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis and druginduced hypersensitivity syndrome, are rare and occasionally fatal. However, it is difficult to detect SCARs at the drug development stage, necessitating a new approach for prediction. Therefore, in this study, using the chemical structure information
of SCAR-causative drugs from the Japanese Adverse Drug Event Report (JADER) database, we tried to develop a predictive
classification model of SCAR through deep learning. In the JADER database from 2004 to 2017, we defined 185 SCAR-positive
drugs and 195 SCAR-negative drugs using proportional reporting ratios as the signal detection method, and the total number
of reports. These SCAR-positive and SCAR-negative drugs were randomly divided into the training dataset for model construction and the test dataset for evaluation. The model performance was evaluated in the independent test dataset inside
the applicability domain (AD), which is the chemical space for reliable prediction results. Using the deep learning model with
molecular descriptors as the drug structure information, the area under the curve was 0.76 for the 148 drugs of the test dataset inside the AD. The method developed in the present study allows for utilizing the JADER database for SCAR classification,
with potential to improve screening efficiency in the development of new drugs. This method may also help to noninvasively
identify the causative drug, and help assess the causality between drugs and SCARs in postmarketing surveillance.
Study Highlights
WHAT IS THE CURRENT KNOWLEDGE ON THE TOPIC?
✔ Severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs) have a
low incidence, and the mechanism remains unknown. In
addition, it is difficult to predict the relationship between
drugs and SCARs at the development stage because a
wide variety of drugs cause SCARs.
WHAT QUESTION DID THIS STUDY ADDRESS?
✔ Development of an efficient and reliable in silico method
for predicting SCAR-causative drugs.
WHAT DOES THIS STUDY ADD TO OUR KNOWLEDGE?
✔ The combination of the Japanese Adverse Drug Event
Report database, a large-scale postmarketing drug adverse effect database, and deep learning was proven

Stevens–Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis
and drug-induced hypersensitivity syndrome are representative severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs), which
are considered to be idiosyncratic adverse drug reactions.
Although the incidence of SCAR is low, it remains a serious
problem owing to its high mortality. Many antibiotics, anticonvulsants, and antipyretic analgesics have been reported
to be related to SCARs, but all drugs can be potential

to be a new approach that enables evaluating the risk
of SCAR-causative drugs from only chemical structure
information.
HOW MIGHT THIS CHANGE CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY OR TRANSLATIONAL SCIENCES?
✔ A rapid and noninvasive identification method of SCARcausative drugs by deep learning is considered to be a
useful technique to evaluate the causal relationship between the corresponding drug and SCAR. The results of
this study will therefore help to reduce the risk of SCARs
in clinical trials and during postmarketing surveillance, in
addition to improving screening efficiency in new drug
development.

causative agents.1–6 Because SCAR has high species differences and a low occurrence, prediction of SCAR is difficult
at the new drug development stage. In other words, SCAR
is often found for the first time during postmarketing surveillance. In addition, it is extremely difficult to identify the
causative agent of an SCAR from multiple candidate drugs.
To overcome these problems, the development of an efficient approach to predict SCAR is very important.

In Silico Approach to Predict SCARs
Ambe et al.
757

Recently, an in silico method has drawn attention as
a powerful approach for predicting idiosyncratic adverse
drug reactions, the mechanism of which is unknown
and complicated. By analyzing a large amount of existing data, machine learning can help learn certain rules
and predict new data. Some studies have attempted to
predict drug-induced liver injury by machine learning.7–9
Therefore, it is desirable to develop an in silico prediction
method for SCARs by machine learning using postmarketing data.
Postmarketing safety information is one of the main
sources of SCARs because these reactions may only appear after a drug is already approved and used by a large
number of patients. In recent years, the number of reports
for spontaneous reporting systems (SRSs) has been increasing, offering an important source of information as a
large-scale database for the detection of rare and severe adverse events.10 The Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices
Agency (PMDA), the Japanese regulatory authority, has accumulated comprehensively adverse event reports related
to pharmaceuticals and has been published in the Japanese
Adverse Drug Event Report (JADER) database. Many studies have investigated the relationship between a drug and
adverse drug events using the JADER database.11–14 In the
SRS database, information on the possibility of a causal relationship between adverse events and drugs that have not
been known so far could be detected using signal detection
approaches.15–17
In this study, we focused on developing an SCAR classification model using drug structure information from the JADER
database. First, datasets from the JADER database were
obtained using signal detection. Thereafter, we calculated molecular descriptors as the structure information of drugs and
developed classification models using deep learning. Hence,
our in silico prediction model could improve screening efficiency
at the developmental stage of new drugs. This method may
also support the identification of causative agents of SCARs
from multiple medications both rapidly and noninvasively.
METHODS
Definition of SCARs
Adverse event reports from the first quarter of 2004 to the
second quarter of 2017 were obtained from the JADER
database, a drug adverse effect database constructed by
the PMDA (https://www.pmda.go.jp/safet​y/info-servi​ces/
drugs/​adr-info/suspe​cted-adr/0003.html, accessed on
February 6, 2018). The JADER database contains information on adverse drug reactions and patients in Japan
accumulated during postmarketing surveillance from April
2004, and the database structure is compiled based on the
international safety reporting guidelines of the International
Council for Harmonization of Technical Requirements for
Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) E2B (https://www.
ich.org/produ​cts/guide​lines/​effic​acy/artic​le/effic​acy-guide​
lines.html, accessed on July 6, 2019). The JADER database
includes four data tables: (1) patient demographics information (DEMO), (2) drug information (DRUG), (3) adverse
events (REAC), and (4) primary disease information (HIST).
Data were combined using the ID numbers of the respective tables, and necessary data extraction was performed.

Although the drugs were classified into three groups, “suspected drug,” “interacting drug,” and “concomitant drug,”
in the DRUG file, our analysis was conducted on only the
“suspected drug” group. In addition, because SCARs are
based on systemic adverse effects, drugs that are known to
hardly migrate to the blood and unknown route drugs were
eliminated considering the administration route.
Adverse event names are registered based on the
Preferred Term of Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities
(MedDRA) compiled by the ICH (https://www.meddra.org/,
accessed on February 21, 2018). SCARs were defined according to Standardized MedDRA Queries severe cutaneous
adverse reactions/20000020, described in MedDRA/J version 20.1, and 14 preferred terms included in a narrow area
were used (Table S1).
To detect drugs that were likely to cause SCARs, the proportional reporting ratio (PRR) was used as a signal detection
method. A signal was detected if the PRR was 2 or more, the χ2
value was 4 or more, and the number of co-occurrences of interest was 3 or more.15 PRR and χ2 values were calculated from
two-by-two contingency tables relating the presence of a particular drug and the presence of SCAR (Table 1). Furthermore,
in the SRS database, the effects of concomitant drugs need
to be considered.18–20 In other words, the 10 most frequently
reported SCAR-positive candidate drugs may increase the signal of other SCAR-positive drugs. Therefore, we selected the
10 most frequently reported SCAR-positive candidate drugs,
which were considered to have a large impact. Among other
SCAR-positive candidates that were not selected as the 10
most reported, we calculated the reporting odds ratio (ROR)
and its 95% confidence interval (CI) from two-by-two contingency tables of the presence or absence of combined use with
the 10 most reported SCAR-positive candidate drugs and the
presence or absence of SCAR.17 If the lower limit of the 95%
CI was > 1, it was regarded as a drug affected by the combined use of the 10 most reported drugs. We excluded these
drugs and created another new list considering the effects of
concomitant drugs. SCAR-negative candidate drugs were extracted according to the following criteria: (1) no SCAR reports
and (2) the total number of reports is ≥ 20.
Predictive model development
To develop a classification model for SCARs, we focused
on deep learning.21 Deep learning is an effective tool for

The proportional reporting ratio value was calculated as n11/(n11 + n12) divided by n21/(n21 + n22). The χ2 value was calculated as (n11 + n12 + n21 + n22)
(|n11n22 – n12n21| – (n11 + n12 + n21 + n22)/2)2 divided by (n11 + n12) (n21 + n22)

modeling complex nonlinear relationships, such as the relationship between SCARs and various causative drugs.
To create a dataset for the model, any mixtures, large
peptides, herbal products, bacterial preparations, inorganic compounds, organometallic compounds, and
unspecified names or abbreviated drugs were removed.
Furthermore, if the same generic name existed for
SCAR-positive and SCAR-negative candidate drugs,
both drugs were excluded. With the help of a PubChem
search (https://pubch​em.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/, accessed on
February 21, 2018) and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes
and Genomes DRUG database (https://www.genome.
jp/kegg/drug/, accessed on February 21, 2018), the canonical Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System was
collected, and all salts were removed and then the main
structures were neutralized whenever possible. In addition,
the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classification information of drugs was extracted using the Kyoto
Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes DRUG database.
ATC is an international classification of drugs devised by
the World Health Organization (https://www.whocc.no/atc/
struc​ture_and_princ​iples/, accessed on July 6, 2019). We
used the second-level therapeutic subgroup of the ATC
classification.
Following the curation of drugs, the SCAR-positive and
SCAR-negative drugs in the original dataset were represented by two-dimensional molecular descriptors calculated
using Dragon 7 software (Talete srl., Milano, Italy). Molecular
descriptors represent structured data that facilitate calculation and offer the additional advantage of versatility. Dragon
7 can calculate up to 5,270 molecular descriptors consisting
of 30 blocks, such as atom type and functional group/fragment count. After preprocessing the descriptors, they were
used in the model. The original dataset was randomly divided at a 1:1 ratio into a training dataset and a test dataset,
comprising the same proportion of positive and negative
drugs as the original. In addition, the balance of the ATC
classification was also maintained to eliminate bias in drug
efficacy. The training dataset was used for model construction and the independent test dataset was used for model
evaluation.
Furthermore, the applicability domain (AD), which is the
drug structure space that is reliably predicted, was defined in the test dataset for evaluating the model using a
distance-based method.22 First, the average distance
of all data in the training dataset was calculated from the
Euclidean distance, and then a threshold was set. If the distance between a drug in the test dataset and all training data
was within the threshold, it was considered to be inside the
AD.23,24 Euclidean distance, as the distance between any
two drugs, was calculated from the descriptors used for the
model.25
The balanced accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive
predictive value, negative predictive value, and area under
the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC)26 were calculated as the performance indices.
Deep learning was run through the package “h2o” (3.16.0.2)
in R (version 3.4.4) software (h2o: R Interface for “H2O.”
https://CRAN.R-proje​ct.org/packa​ge=h2o, accessed on
July 6, 2019), which is based on a multilayer feedforward
Clinical and Translational Science

artificial neural network. Our classification model consists
of four layers: the input layer, two hidden layers, and the
output layer. We fixed two layers as hidden layers because
three or more did not improve the accuracy, and the model
including more layers took a long time to run. Using the
training dataset, we optimized the activation functions and
regularization of l1 and l2. For the activation function, we
examined the functions of Tanh, TanhWithDropout, Rectifier,
and RectifierWithDropout, which can be selected in h2o
for deep learning. We also examined an activation function
that implements dropout to avoid overfitting. The Gedeon
method was used to calculate the variable importance.27
Details of the preprocessing of descriptors and evaluation
methods are provided in Supplementary Material S1. The
codes for setting the AD and SCAR prediction models for
new data are provided in Supplementary Material S2. The
training and test datasets are provided in Supplementary
Material S3.
Patient characteristics
Patient characteristics associated with SCAR-positive and
SCAR-negative drugs in the original dataset were examined
using data from the JADER database from the first quarter
of 2004 to the second quarter of 2017. The characteristics
investigated were sex and age. Patient age was divided
into four groups (0–9, 10–19, 20–59, and ≥ 60 years). To
determine if the patient characteristics affected the onset
of SCAR, we compared the characteristic factors of the
SCAR-positive and SCAR-negative groups. The standardized difference was used to compare the mean of
categorical baseline variables between the SCAR-positive
and SCAR-negative treatment groups28 using the following
formula:
(
) √
d = Ppositive − Pnegative ∕ ( Ppositive ( 1 − Ppositive ) + Pnegative ( 1 − Pnegative ) ) ∕ 2

where Ppositive and Pnegative denote the proportion of the
variable of interest in the SCAR-positive and SCARnegative group, respectively. The standardized difference
is the comparison of the mean difference in accumulated
standard deviation units. Moreover, regardless of the sample size, the standardized difference can be compared
with variables measured in different units. If the absolute
value of the standardized difference is < 0.1, the difference between the treatment groups is considered to be
negligible.29
Software
JADER database management and analyses were performed using SAS (version 9.4; SAS Institute, Cary, NC).
Mathematical processing of the data and model construction were performed using R (version 3.4.4).

event in a one-to-one correspondence. The total number
of drugs excluding common name duplication was 7,070.
Furthermore, only “suspected drugs” were selected and
limited only to the administration route that is likely to be
transferred to the blood. Subsequently, 294 SCAR-positive
candidate drugs were detected using PRR criteria,15 and
433 SCAR-negative candidate drugs were detected using
2 criteria: no SCAR reports and ≥ 20 total reports. Other
conditions were tested, including 3 total reports or more
and 10 total reports or more, but setting the condition of
a total of 20 reports or more was well balanced with the
number of SCAR-positive drugs (data not shown).
Among SCAR-positive candidate drugs, the 10 most frequently reported drugs were selected (Table 2), which are all
known to cause SCARs.1–6,11–14,30 Furthermore, in the SRS
database, the effects of concomitant drugs need to be considered.18–20 To investigate the influence of the combined
use of the 10 most frequently reported drugs, SCAR-positive
candidate drugs affected by the combination were extracted
using ROR as the risk ratio. For 284 unselected drugs, excluding the top 10 drugs, cross tables were created for the
presence or absence of combined use with the 10 most frequently reported drugs and for the presence or absence of
SCAR (Figure 2). The lower limit of the 95% CI for ROR exceeded 1 for 22 drugs. These 22 drugs were then excluded
from the list of candidate SCAR-positive drugs as they were

found to be affected by the combination with the 10 most
frequently reported drugs (Table S2).
The chemical structures of the SCAR-positive and SCARnegative candidate drugs were confirmed. The original
dataset of the SCARs classification predictive model consisted of 380 unique drugs, comprising 185 SCAR-positive
drugs and 195 SCAR-negative drugs, and the model dataset
considering the effects of concomitant drugs consisted of

360 unique drugs, comprising 165 SCAR-positive drugs and
195 SCAR-negative drugs. The generic names of SCARpositive drugs and SCAR-negative drugs, ATC classification,
calculated PRR, χ2 values, and the number of reports are
summarized in Table S2.
Patient characteristics
The characteristics (sex and age) of patients in the database that had used the 185 SCAR-positive and 195
SCAR-negative drugs among the 380 drugs classified as
“suspected drug” from the original dataset were investigated (Table 3). A difference in patient characteristics
between the SCAR-positive and SCAR-negative groups
could be a potential factor affecting SCARs development.
The total number of reports was 71,277 for SCAR-positive
drugs and 13,650 for SCAR-negative drugs. When the
standardized difference between SCAR-positive and
SCAR-negative groups was determined for each variable,
the value for sex was 0.02 and that for age was in the range
of 0.03–0.07. The difference between groups was considered to be insignificant when the absolute difference was
< 0.1; thus, there was no difference between SCAR-positive
and SCAR-negative groups with respect to sex and age.
Model performance
The test dataset was evaluated using the drugs that were
inside the AD, which is considered to be a reliable chemical
space for prediction.22 The coverage reflects the percentage of drugs inside the AD of the test dataset. Among the
total 380 drugs in the original dataset of the SCARs classification model, there were 191 training drugs, comprising
93 positive and 98 negative drugs. The test dataset for the

AD included 148 drugs, and the coverage was 0.78. The
dataset of the model considering the effects of concomitant drugs included 360 drugs, comprising 181 drugs in the
training set (83 positive and 98 negative), and 144 drugs in
the test set for the AD, with a coverage of 0.80. As a preliminary analysis, we performed an exploratory search for the
number of nodes and regularization of l1 and l2. We performed a random search in various ranges and evaluated
the logloss function of cross-validation. We found a narrow
range for the regularization of l1 and l2, where performance
improvement was expected; however, the number of nodes
did not show any performance improvement in a specific
range (data not shown). Therefore, the number of nodes in
the hidden layer was adopted as the default value (200).
The number of descriptors with preprocessed and prediction categories was used as the number of nodes in the
input layer and the output layer, respectively. Therefore, the
final SCARs classification model consisted of 656 nodes for
the input layer, 200 nodes for each of the 2 hidden layers,
and 2 nodes of the output layer. The model considering the
effects of concomitant drugs consisted of 647 nodes for
the input layer, 200 nodes for each of the 2 hidden layers,
and 2 nodes of the output layer. Finally, we optimized the
activation functions (Tanh, TanhWithDropout, Rectifier, and
RectifierWithDropout) and regularization of l1 (0–0.00001)
and l2 (0–0.001) by 3-fold cross-validation using AUC as the
evaluation criterion (Table S3). Other parameters were set
to the default values. Different molecular descriptors were
used in the SCARs classification model and in the model
considering the effect of concomitant drugs (Table S4).
The prediction performances are summarized in Table 4.

the AD had an AUC of 0.76. In the deep learning SCARs
classification model, the five most important descriptors
extracted were “C-005: CH3X,” “VE1sign_Dz(p): coefficient
sum of the last eigenvector from Barysz matrix weighted by
polarizability,” “nRCOOH: number of carboxylic acids (aliphatic),” “B05[O-O]: presence/absence of O-O at topological

Burden matrix weighted by mass” (https://chm.kode-solut​
ions.net/produ​cts_dragon_descr​iptors.php, accessed on
June 10, 2020). There was no improvement in prediction
performance using the model in which the effect of concomitant drugs was considered, with an AUC of 0.73.
The 380 drugs in the original dataset were aggregated
by ATC classification. These were divided into 62 ATC
classifications. The largest number was 57 drugs in the classification “J01 Antibacterials for systemic use” (Table 5).
There were 199 drugs included in the 10 most frequently
classified ATC classifications. The remaining 181 drugs
were classified into 52 ATC classifications; therefore, various medicinal effects were included in the original dataset.
The prediction results of the 148 test datasets inside the AD
were then evaluated for each ATC classification (Table 5).
“J01 Antibacterials for systemic use,” “L01 Antineoplastic
agents,” “A02 Drugs for acid related disorders,” “M01 Antiinflammatory and antirheumatic products,” “R05 Cough
and cold preparations,” and “R06 Antihistamines for systemic use” had high accuracy rates, ranging from 0.75 to
1.00. Except for “L01 Antineoplastic agents,” these ATC
classifications included more SCAR-positive drugs than
SCAR-negative drugs. “C01 Cardiac therapy” and “N07

Other nervous system drugs” had an accuracy rate lower
than 0.5. There was a tendency for the prediction of negative drugs to be incorrect.
DISCUSSION
In this study, we developed a deep learning prediction
model to classify SCARs caused by a variety of drugs using
only drug structure information. Prediction results with 148
test drugs in the test dataset inside the AD demonstrated
an AUC of 0.76. In addition, the sensitivity was 0.81 and the
negative predictive value was 0.76, indicating few false negatives (Table 4). This acceptable prediction performance
indicates that this is a suitable model for reducing overlooked SCAR-positive drugs and excluding SCAR-negative
drugs. With our model, it is possible to predict SCAR for
drugs not only within the JADER database but also out
of the JADER database if the structural information of the
drugs is available. In addition, we set the AD as the chemical space in our model, which can provide highly reliable
prediction results if the drug is inside the AD. Therefore, our
model can be applied at the global scale even though we
used the Japanese adverse effect database for the present
model development and assessment.
Because it is difficult to obtain the exact SCAR risk from
the JADER database, we used the presence or absence
of a signal to calculate the risk of SCAR for a given drug.
The PRR has been widely used for the signal detection of
adverse drug reactions in adverse reaction reporting databases.15 Therefore, we regarded drugs that showed an

adverse reaction signal based on the PRR as SCAR-positive
drugs. There is a known risk of PRR value inflation, which
may cause false signal detection if the number of reports
is very small.31 However, the maximum PRR value in this
study was 33 (Table S2) because the number of reports of
other drugs was high even if the number of SCAR reports for
the drugs of interest was small. This result suggested that
PRR value inflation was not occurring in our SCAR-positive
dataset, and that the PRR-based criterion for SCAR-positive
definition was appropriate in this case. We also considered
the potential risk of SCARs in drugs that are specifically
known to be related to the onset of SCARs, even if the total
number of reports was small. Therefore, the total number of
reports was not taken into consideration for SCAR-positive
drug selection (Figure 1). By contrast, we defined SCARnegative drugs as those with no SCAR-related reports and
20 or more of the total number of reports.
The 10 most frequently reported drugs among the SCARpositive candidate drugs included carbamazepine and
lamotrigine as anticonvulsants, allopurinol for hyperuricemia,
loxoprofen and acetaminophen as antipyretic analgesics,
clarithromycin and amoxicillin as antibacterial drugs, celecoxib as a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, cold agent,
and lansoprazole as a proton pump inhibitor (Table 2). All 10
drugs have been previously reported to be related to SCARs,
which is also included in the package inserts.1–6,11–14,30 This
concordance suggests that our criteria for SCAR-positive
candidate drugs was appropriate for model construction.
Using the standardized difference, we compared the patients’ general demographic characteristics in the original
dataset (Table 3). Because the standardized difference was
< 0.1, it indicated a negligible difference in the mean between two groups,28,29 indicating that any bias of patient sex
and patient age did not affect the construction of the model.
In the JADER database, it is important to consider whether
the reported adverse event is due to a drug or only appears
with the combination of other drugs. Although analyses of
drug interactions in the SRS database have been performed,
there is no established method.18–20 Therefore, to examine
whether the SCAR-positive drugs in the dataset used for the
prediction model were appropriate, we built a model considering the effects of the concomitant drugs (Figure 2). It
was hypothesized that if the predictive performance of this
model was improved over the original model, the 22 drugs
excluded would be less likely to cause SCARs. Interestingly,
the prediction performance of the model in which the effects of combinations were considered (AUC = 0.73) did
not improve compared with the performance of the original
model (AUC = 0.76). Although the 22 drugs excluded may
be affected by the combination of the 10 most frequently reported drugs, these drugs are highly likely to cause SCARs.
In conclusion, our analysis suggests that SCAR-positive
drugs in the original dataset are appropriate.
The efficacy of the 380 drugs in the original dataset was
confirmed using the ATC classification (Table 5). The prediction result of “J01 Antibacterials for systemic use,” which
had the largest number of drugs, was almost perfectly in
line with the candidate SCAR-positive drugs. This is considered to be due to the large number of cephem antibiotics
having a β-lactam structure in the drugs included in the
Clinical and Translational Science

ATC classification “J01 Antibacterials for systemic use.”
Therefore, there is a possibility that the prediction of SCARnegative drugs belonging to “J01 Antibacterials for systemic
use” by our model has not been correctly evaluated. The
ATC classification that classified the second highest number
of drugs was “L01 Antineoplastic agents.” Antineoplastic
agents are associated with numerous adverse effects, and
there are many such reports in the JADER database. As a
result, antineoplastic agents tend to be extracted as SCARnegative drugs because they easily meet the criteria.
In the SCARs classification model, “nRCOOH” was selected as one of the most highly important descriptors.
This descriptor belongs to the functional group count and
indicates the number of carboxylic acids (aliphatic). Of
the 53 SCAR-positive drugs in the ATC classification “J01
Antibacterials for systemic use,” 19 drugs contain aliphatic
carboxylic acids, and 18 drugs contain aliphatic carboxylic
acids and a β-lactam structure.32 However, of the 53 SCARpositive drugs in the ATC classification “J01 Antibacterials
for systemic use,” 28 drugs contain a β-lactam structures.
Because the variable importance of “nBeta-Lactams: number of β-lactams” ranked 28th, “nRCOOH,” which ranked
third, may be a key functional group for discriminating
SCAR-positive drugs and SCAR-negative drugs among
drugs with various chemical structures.
In studying adverse effects based on the SRS database,
it is necessary to interpret the results carefully owing to
reporting biases, such as under-reporting and the impact
of safety information.33 In addition, the frequency of occurrence of adverse events cannot be determined using
SRS databases, including the JADER database. Although
SRS databases are subject to a large amount of noise,
most of the information is available as real-world data, including a vast amount of accumulating information about
the spontaneous reporting of adverse effects. Thus, an
SRS database offers a good source of information for
SCARs owing to its low incidence and the fact that it often
is only detected during postmarketing surveillance. The
combination of machine learning and an SRS database
to construct a predictive model of SCARs will be an important approach for further research on adverse effects.
Moreover, the JADER database contains well-validated
information because it examines the reported adverse effects information to identify suspected drugs. Therefore,
it is considered that the accuracy of the relationship between the drug and the adverse effect is relatively high.
We considered that this advantage of the JADER database
was important for training data of the model.
In conclusion, we developed a classification model of
SCARs in humans based on the chemical structure information of SCAR-causative drugs in the JADER database.
Although this model is not suitable for the quantitative
risk assessment of SACRs, we consider that the model
constructed in this study is useful for qualitative risk assessment. This prediction model is a noninvasive and highly
efficient support method for clinical trials and postmarketing
surveillance. Furthermore, utilizing the JADER database and
the machine learning method is expected to promote the
use of SRS databases in the research on adverse effects,
such as drug-induced liver injury.
