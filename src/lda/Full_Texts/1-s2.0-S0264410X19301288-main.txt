Background: Trivalent adjuvanted influenza vaccine (aIIV3; FluadÒ) was approved in the United States
(U.S.) in 2015 for adults aged 65 years and has been in use since the 2016–17 influenza season.
Methods: We analyzed U.S. reports for aIIV3 submitted from July 1, 2016 through June 30, 2018 to the
Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), a national spontaneous reporting system. Medical
records were reviewed for serious reports. Among individuals 65 years of age, the relative frequency
of the most commonly reported adverse events (AEs) after aIIV3 were compared with non-adjuvanted
inactivated influenza vaccines given to adults aged 65 years, high-dose trivalent influenza vaccine
(IIV3-HD) and trivalent or quadrivalent vaccines (IIV3/IIV4). Data mining analyses were undertaken to
identify whether AEs for aIIV3 occurred disproportionately more than expected compared to all influenza
vaccines.
Results: VAERS received 630 reports after aIIV3, of which 521 (83%) were in adults aged 65 years; 79
(13%) in persons <65 years and in 30 (5%) reports age was missing; 19 (3%) reports were serious, including two deaths (0.4%) related to myocardial infarction and Sjogren’s syndrome. The most common AEs
reported in adults aged 65 years were injection site pain (21%) and erythema (18%), with similar proportions reported for IIV3-HD (17% and 19%, respectively) and for IIV3/IIV4 (15%, each). Except for reports
related to vaccination of inappropriate age (n = 79) and syringe malfunction (n = 6), data mining did not
identify other disproportionately reported AEs.
Conclusions: Although our review of aIIV3 in VAERS did not identify any unexpected health conditions of
concern, we observed more than twice the expected number of reports with administration of the vaccine
to persons outside of the age range for which the vaccine is approved in the U.S. Health care providers
should be educated on the age groups for whom aIIV3 is recommended.

1. Introduction
On November 24, 2015, the United States (U.S.) Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) approved FluadÒ (aIIV3) (Seqirus), under
accelerated approval, for the prevention of seasonal influenza in
adults aged 65 years [1]. aIIV3, a trivalent vaccine produced from
three influenza virus strains (two subtype A and one type B), is the
first U.S. licensed seasonal adjuvanted influenza vaccine. On October 15, 2015, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices

(ACIP) recommended routine use of aIIV3 in adults aged 65 years
during 2016–17 influenza season [2].
Adjuvants are incorporated into some vaccine formulations to
enhance or direct the immune response of the vaccinated individuals [1,3,4]. aIIV3 is formulated using an egg-based process and the
adjuvant MF59Ò, an oil-in-water emulsion of squalene oil. Squalene, a naturally occurring substance found in humans, animals,
and plants, is highly purified for the vaccine manufacturing process. Safety and immunogenicity studies, on which current
approval for aIIV3 is based, suggest that aIIV3 provides an alternative to other recommended non-adjuvanted inactivated influenza
vaccines for adults aged 65 years [1,3].
aIIV3 was first approved for use in Italy in 1997 and is currently
approved in 38 countries, including Canada and 15 European

P. Haber et al. / Vaccine 37 (2019) 1516–1520

countries [2,5,6]. aIIV3 is approved also for pediatric use (6 through
24 months) in Canada and other European countries [5,6]. aIIV3
has been evaluated extensively in clinical trials in both young children and adults. In both groups, systemic reactions were comparable to trivalent influenza vaccines [3,7]. Safety of aIIV3 in elderly
subjects has been assessed in 15 randomized controlled clinical
studies and safety concerns were not identified [2–6].
Post-licensure safety studies of the elderly in Italy reported a
similar safety profile among individuals receiving aIIV3 and nonadjuvanted influenza vaccines [5,8]. The most commonly reported
adverse events (AEs) were injection site pain and tenderness, muscle aches, headache, and fatigue [1,8,9].
aIIV3 is the first adjuvanted influenza vaccine in the U.S. market. In this review, we analyzed the safety profile of aIIV3 by
reviewing reports submitted to the U.S. Vaccine Adverse Event
Reporting System (VAERS).

deemed as nonspecific, or general in nature as described elsewhere
[17].
Cause of death was determined from information documented
in the autopsy report, death certificate, or medical record. We did
not assess causality of the AE following vaccination. Reports of
GBS and anaphylaxis were verified using the Brighton Collaboration criteria or a physician’s diagnosis documented on the medical
records [18–20].
2.4. Comparative review
We compared the most common MedDRA PTs associated with
aIIV3 reports with those reported for trivalent or quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccines (IIV3/IIV4) and high-dose trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV3-HD) among adults 65 years of age
during the same study period. We grouped the most commonly
reported PTs and compared the proportions with those reported
for IIV3-HD and IIV3/IIV4. Finally, we compared the proportion of
GBS and anaphylaxis reports in these same vaccine groups.

2.1. Data source
2.5. Disproportionality analysis (data mining)
VAERS is a national, spontaneous reporting system coadministered by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC) and the FDA for monitoring AEs following vaccination
[10,11]. VAERS accepts reports from vaccine manufacturers,
healthcare providers, vaccine recipients and others (e.g., pharmacists). VAERS data include information on demographics of the vaccinee, vaccine administered, concurrent medications and
vaccinations, medical history, reporter type (person submitting
the report), the AE, and the outcome of the AE. For U.S. serious
reports, medical records are routinely requested and reviewed,
except for reports submitted by vaccine manufacturers. A report
is considered serious if the AE results in death, life-threatening illness, hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization,
permanent disability or birth defect [12].
Signs and symptoms of AEs are coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) terms according to
guidance from the International Conference on Harmonization
[13]. MedDRA terms are arranged in categories that range from
broad terms or System Organ Class (SOC) to more specific terms
or Preferred Terms (PTs). A single VAERS report may be assigned
one or more PTs within one or more SOCs. We searched the VAERS
database for all aIIV3 reports received from July 1, 2016 through
June 30, 2018. Foreign reports were excluded.

We used Empirical Bayesian (EB) data mining techniques [15]
to identify AEs reported more often than expected following aIIV3
compared to AEs reported for all vaccines (other than influenza
vaccines) and for all influenza vaccines. The primary statistic calculated with data mining is the Empirical Bayes Geometric Mean
(EBGM) and its associated 90% confidence interval (EB05, EB95).
An EB05  2.0 is commonly used as a threshold for considering
an AE as a potential signal because it suggests a high probability
that a vaccine-event pair occurs at least twice as often as expected,
with the underlying assumption that vaccine-event pairs are random [16]. AEs reported for aIIV3 were compared to AEs associated
with all U.S. vaccine reports or all U.S. influenza vaccine reports in
VAERS submitted during the study period. Analyses were adjusted
for sex, age, and year report received. AEs were assessed overall (all
ages, all events); overall, excluding individuals with unknown age;
by age group (<65 years, 65 years, unspecified/unknown); and by
seriousness (all events, serious events only). Of note, disproportionality analyses are intended to assess potential signals and do
not imply causality between the vaccine-event pair.

2.2. Descriptive analysis
We determined the frequency of MedDRA PTs and tabulated the
most common relevant PTs. We also calculated the mean and median ages of individuals at time of vaccination and AE onset interval
(time from vaccination [day 0] to date of onset of first symptoms
related to AEs).
2.3. Clinical review of reports
We reviewed all serious VAERS reports and all available medical
records, including death certificates and autopsy reports, if applicable, submitted for aIIV3 during July 1, 2016 through June 30, 2018
[14]. We also reviewed reports and medical records for the following pre-specified conditions: Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) and
anaphylaxis. Additionally, we reviewed reports for MedDRA PTs
of clinical or epidemiological importance that exceeded the data
mining threshold (i.e. EB05  2.0) using data mining techniques
described below [15,16]. We excluded from the clinical review
reports of AEs described in the aIIV3 package insert or those

From July 1, 2016 through June 30, 2018, VAERS received a total
of 630 U.S. reports of which 521 (82.7%) were for adults aged
65 years, 79 (12.5%) were for adults aged <65 years, and 30
(4.8%) had age unspecified. aIIV3 was administered alone, without
a concurrent vaccine, in 325 (62%) reports. Pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV) was the most commonly co-administered
vaccine (n = 115; 18%) followed by pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) (n = 69; 11%) [Table 1].
Twenty-one (3%) were serious reports, including two death
reports (0.3%). Three serious reports (14%) described AEs occurring
in adults aged <65 years; one of them described a case of GBS in a
32-year-old female [Table 2].
3.2. Clinical review of all serious reports
Among serious, non-death reports, 16 were described in
females and three in males. The median onset interval was within
one day of vaccination (range 0–47 days). Table 2 lists the main
diagnoses of these serious reports classified by SOCs. Neurological

Three serious, non-death reports in persons <65 years of age included one
report each of cellulitis, fever/chills/myalgia, and unverified Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS). The report of GBS (32-year-old female) was not classified as serious
because the diagnosis could not be verified and therefore, is not included in this
table.

and musculoskeletal conditions comprised the most common
groups of serious AEs. Three serious reports involved persons aged
<65 years: GBS in a 32-year-old female, left deltoid cellulitis in a
27-year-old female, and fever, chills, and myalgia in a 20-yearold female. Two deaths following aIIV3 vaccination were reported:
a 75-year-old male with cause of death reported as Sjogren’s syndrome and a 65-year-old male who died due to myocardial infarction [Table 2].

3.3. Comparative analysis
The most common PTs after aIIV3 were similar to those
reported after IIV3-HD and IIV3/IIV4 among individuals 65 years
of age. The most common AEs were injection site pain (21%) and
erythema (18%), with similar proportions reported for IIV3-HD
(17% and 19%, respectively) and for IIV3/IIV4 (15%, each)
[Table 3a]. Among select, pre-specified conditions [Table 3b], there
were no reports of anaphylaxis among 521 reports for aIIV3, and
anaphylaxis accounted for 0.2% (8 out of 4383) and 0.4% (4 out of
1095) reports following IIV3-HD and IIV3/IIV4, respectively. Three
cases (0.6%) of GBS were reported following aIIV3, a similar proportion following IIV3-HD (0.7%; n = 31), and a relatively higher proportion after IIV3/IIV4 (1.6%; n = 17).
3.4. Clinical review of pre-specified adverse events and conditions
3.4.1. Anaphylaxis
Among the 521 aIIV3 reports submitted for individuals
65 years of age, there were no cases of anaphylaxis [Table 3b].
3.4.2. Guillain-Barré syndrome
Four reports of GBS occurring after aIIV3 were submitted to
VAERS during the review period. Three reports involved a single
aIIV3 vaccine, and one report noted concurrent vaccination with
aIIV3 and PCV13. In one report of GBS (32-year-old female), medical records were not available, and the diagnosis could not be verified. Among the verified reports, the affected individuals (2 males
and 1 female) were aged 70, 73, and 74 years. The onset interval
from vaccination to appearance of neurological symptoms ranged
from 1 to 8 days. Two reports met Brighton level criteria 1 and 3,
and a third did not meet Brighton criteria, but was considered as
GBS by the attending physician. None of the three patients had a
recent history of a respiratory or gastrointestinal infection.
3.4.3. Data mining
Serious AEs were not reported disproportionately for aIIV3
compared to all other vaccines nor compared to all influenza vaccines. Data mining analyses revealed disproportionate reporting
for the PT’s ‘drug administered to patient of inappropriate age’
(n = 62) and ‘syringe issue’ (n = 6). Among reports of drug administered to patient of inappropriate age, the median age at vaccination
was 38 years (range 5–64 years). Seven were reports in children.
Most reports (57 out of 62; 91.9%) did not describe an AE. The
AEs in five reports were mild conditions including excessive sleeping, malaise, headache, fatigue, and injection site pain. Two reports
with no AE were in pregnant women who received the vaccine at
15-weeks and 39-weeks gestation. Reports of ‘syringe issue’ were
either leakage of the vaccine outside the syringe due to a problem
with the syringe/needle attachment (n = 4), or difficulty pushing
the plunger (n = 2). The age and sex of individuals involved in these
six reports was unknown.
4. Discussion
This is the first VAERS-based post-marketing safety review of
aIIV3 since U.S. licensure with an indication for use in adults aged
65 years. Our review of AEs following aIIV3 administration in the
U.S. did not identify any unexpected health condition of concern.
However, we did observe administration of the vaccine to persons
<65 years of age in whom the vaccine is not recommended. Syringe
issues were also reported disproportionately more often than with
other vaccines, but review of these cases did not reveal any consistent patterns in reports nor an association with a specific lot
number.

Our findings were consistent with pre-licensure studies, which
found that local reactions such as injection site pain and injection
site erythema were the most common AEs [1]. In post-licensure
meta-analysis of clinical trials in elderly adults, local reactions
were slightly more common for aIIV3 than IIV3, but the occurrence
of fever was comparable between these vaccines. Overall, AEs in
pre-licensure studies were generally mild and transient [3,8]. Collective data from 1997 to 2010, including clinical trials and post
marketing studies, encompassed 160 million people of all ages,
and documented similar local reactions and a similar safety profile
compared to non-adjuvanted influenza vaccines in the elderly
[2,3,5,9].
In this review, the most common serious, non-death reports
included neurological conditions. Four reports of GBS following
aIIV3 were submitted, one in an adult <65 years of age. In all four
reports, the interval between date of vaccination and symptom
onset (1–8 days) was within the window of biologic plausibility
[18,21–24]. GBS is an acute, immune-mediated paralytic disorder
of the peripheral nervous system which was first linked to influenza vaccination during the vaccination campaign for the 1976
swine influenza A(H1N1) pandemic threat and has been shown
to be associated with receipt of seasonal inactivated influenza vaccines in adults in some influenza seasons [21–23]. When an association has been noted, the attributable risk of GBS in adults after
seasonal inactivated influenza vaccines has been approximately
1–3 additional cases per million vaccinees [24,25]. Data mining
did not detect disproportionate reporting of GBS following aIIV3
compared with other vaccines or other influenza vaccines. The four
reported cases of GBS [Table 2] should be interpreted in the context of nearly six million doses of aIIV3 distributed in the U.S.
(Seqirus personal communication June 2018).
Anaphylaxis may be causally associated with influenza vaccination in rare instances [19,20]. Our review did not identify reports of
anaphylaxis after aIIV3 and few reports after IIV3-HD or IIV3/IIV4.

The strength of this study is use of VAERS, a nationally representative, passive surveillance system which can help identify
safety signals, especially for rare AEs. Following the introduction
of new vaccines or issuance of new vaccination recommendations,
safety data can be rapidly collected and assessed in near real-time
[26]. Such advantages can be useful for a new vaccine such as
aIIV3. However, spontaneous systems such as VAERS can have
important limitations, including biased reporting, over- or underreporting, and inconsistency in quality and completeness of reports
[10,11]. Other limitations include the general inability to assess
causality between an AE from a VAERS report and receipt of a vaccine, and limitations in comparing AEs for vaccines that have been
available on the market for varying periods of time, because AE
reporting to VAERS tends to peak within two years of vaccine
approval and initial uptake [27]. While it is usually not possible
to verify causal associations between vaccines and AEs, assessments in VAERS, including the current study, can help identify
AEs that may warrant follow-up or evaluation in other databases.
In summary, we did not identify new safety concerns associated
with aIIV3 among individuals 65 years, i.e. within the age range
for which the vaccine is approved in the U.S. However, we identified disproportional reporting for ‘drug administered to patient of
inappropriate age’. AEs associated with these vaccination errors
were non-serious reports with no obvious immediate effects; however, longer-term effects are not known. Nevertheless, these
reports serve to alert health care providers to review the age group
in whom this vaccine is recommended prior to vaccine administration [28,29]. Because aIIV3 has been available in the U.S. only since
the 2016–17 influenza season, the data available in VAERS describing AEs temporally associated with the vaccine are limited. Thus,
CDC and FDA will continue to monitor AE reports to assess the
safety profile of aIIV3.
