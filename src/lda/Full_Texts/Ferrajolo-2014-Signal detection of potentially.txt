Abstract
Background Data mining in spontaneous reporting databases has shown that drug-induced liver injury is infrequently reported in children.
Objectives Our objectives were to (i) identify drugs
potentially associated with acute liver injury (ALI) in
children and adolescents using electronic healthcare record
(EHR) data; and (ii) to evaluate the significance and novelty of these associations.

Electronic supplementary material The online version of this
article (doi:10.1007/s40264-013-0132-9) contains supplementary
material, which is available to authorized users.

Methods We identified potential cases of ALI during
exposure to any prescribed/dispensed drug for individuals
\18 years old from the EU-ADR network, which includes
seven databases from three countries, covering the years
1996–2010. Several new methods for signal detection were
applied to identify all statistically significant associations
between drugs and ALI. A drug was considered statistically
significantly associated with ALI, using all other time as a
reference category, if the 95 % CI lower band of the relative risk was [1 and in the presence of at least three
exposed cases of ALI. Potentially new signals were distinguished from already known associations concerning
ALI (whether in adults and/or in the paediatric population)

through manual review of published literature and drug
product labels.
Results The study population comprised 4,838,146 individuals aged \18 years, who contributed an overall
25,575,132 person-years of follow-up. Within this population, we identified 1,015 potential cases of ALI. Overall,
20 positive drug–ALI associations were detected. The
associations between ALI and domperidone, flunisolide
and human insulin were considered as potentially new
signals. Citalopram and cetirizine have been previously
described as hepatotoxic in adults but not in children, while
all remaining associations were already known in both
adults and children.
Conclusions Data mining of multiple EHR databases for
signal detection confirmed known associations between
ALI and several drugs, and identified some potentially new
signals in children that require further investigation
through formal epidemiologic studies. This study shows
that EHRs may complement traditional spontaneous
reporting systems for signal detection and strengthening.

1 Introduction
Drug-induced acute liver injury (ALI) is more likely to
occur in the post-marketing than the pre-marketing setting,
as the incidence is low. This is particularly true in children,
since they are not frequently included in clinical trials and,
if included, follow-up is usually short. In an earlier publication, based on data from the World Health Organisation
(WHO) spontaneous reporting system (SRS) database, we
showed that liver toxicity in children is infrequently
reported as an adverse drug reaction (only 1 % of total
reports in the paediatric population), with paracetamol
(acetaminophen), anticonvulsants and anti-tuberculosis
agents being the most frequently implicated drugs [1].
However, it is well known that the reporting of ADRs is
strongly underestimated [1, 2]. In the aftermath of the rofecoxib safety concerns, several initiatives in both the USA
and the EU started to explore the use of routinely collected
data from electronic healthcare records (EHRs) as a source
for signal detection/refinement [3–7]. The EU-ADR Project
(Exploring and Understanding Adverse Drug Reactions by
Integrative Mining of Clinical Records and Biomedical
Knowledge [http://www.euadr-project.org]) is a collaboration of 18 public and private institutions in the EU representing academic research, general practice, healthcare
services administration and pharmaceutical industry that
has produced an integrated system of EHR databases for
drug safety surveillance [8]. The large population coverage
of the EU-ADR network makes it particularly suitable for
drug safety signal detection in special subpopulations such

C. Ferrajolo et al.

as the paediatric population, but its potential in this setting
has not yet been studied.
The aim of this study was to identify drugs associated
with ALI in children and adolescents in the EU-ADR
database network. We further investigated these potential
signals by scrutinizing whether these drug-ALI associations have been previously reported in the adult and/or
paediatric population.

2 Materials and Methods
2.1 Setting
Healthcare data from 1 January 1996 to 31 December
2010 were retrieved from the EU-ADR database network,
which has been described in depth in previous publications [8, 9]. For this study, we used only paediatric data
from seven European EHR and claims databases originating from three countries. Health-Search/CSD LPD
(HSD) and Pedianet from Italy and Integrated Primary
Care Information (IPCI) from the Netherlands are population-based electronic medical record databases that
include demographic and clinical information. The Aarhus
University Hospital Database (Aarhus, Denmark),
PHARMO research database (the Netherlands) and the
regional Italian databases of Lombardy and of Tuscany
(Agenzia Regionale di Sanità della Toscana, ARS) are all
comprehensive record-linkage systems in which drug
dispensing data of a well defined population are linked to
hospital discharge diagnoses and other registries collecting
clinical information (e.g. laboratory tests). Most healthcare
services, including pharmacy services and hospitalizations
are covered by the national health system in Italy and
Denmark and by obligatory health insurance in the
Netherlands. In all of these countries, general practitioners
(GPs) or family paediatricians serve as ‘gatekeepers’ of
the healthcare system.
2.2 Cohort Definition and Follow-Up Time
The study population included all children and adolescents
younger than 18 years who were registered within one of
the above databases for at least 1 year. This 1-year
requirement was waived for newborns and infants younger
than 1 year during the study period whose follow-up started
immediately at date of birth or at their respective registration. Follow-up of all other patients started from cohort
entry until the first occurrence of any of the following
events, whatever came first: first diagnosis of ALI; transferring out of the practice; 18th birthday; death; or end of
the study period (31 December 2010).

Signal Detection of Potentially Drug-Induced ALI in Children

2.3 Acute Liver Injury (ALI) Ascertainment
Both diagnostic codes and laboratory values, whenever
available, were used to ascertain potential cases of ALI in
different databases. As these databases use different terminologies for coding medical diagnoses and contain different types of information, a process of translation of
coding algorithms in different databases was set up, which
was based on identification of ALI-related medical concepts in the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS)
and projection of these codes into different terminologies:
(i) International Classification of Primary Care (ICPC) for
IPCI; (ii) International Classification of Diseases 9th revision-Clinical Modification (ICD-9 CM) for ARS, HSD,
Lombardy, Pedianet and PHARMO; and (iii) ICD-10th
revision for Aarhus. IPCI, HSD, and Pedianet also explored
free text within the clinical narratives, using specific keywords relevant to ALI, as well as pertinent laboratory
examinations, whenever available [10, 11]. The UMLS
codes and coding algorithm for ALI are listed in the
Electronic Supplementary Material.
To prevent finding spurious associations, potential cases
of ALI due to other specified causes, such as viral infections, hepatic neoplasm, autoimmune hepatitis, genetic and
metabolic disorder-related hepatopathy (e.g. hemochromatosis, a1-antitrypsin deficiency, Wilson Disease, Gilbert
Syndrome) and biliary tract diseases, were not included.
2.4 Drug Exposure
Drug exposure was assessed using data from prescriptions
or pharmacy dispensing. Because of the nature of these
databases, exposure to over-the-counter medications, such
as paracetamol, is not captured. All databases code drugs
using the WHO Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC)
classification system. The number of person-years (PY) of
exposure was calculated per single compound (ATC 5th
level). The duration covered by each prescription/dispensing was estimated by the legend duration (if dosing
regimen was available) or based on the defined daily dose
(DDD) [12].
2.5 Data Analysis
Data on patient demographics, clinical events (i.e. ALI), and
prescriptions were locally generated from each database and
formatted towards a simple common data model [13]. Based
on the common data model, data were aggregated by databases using a custom-built software, JerboaÓ [9].
In the EU-ADR, several statistical methods have been
developed and tested for signal detection. Based on a reference set (i.e. surrogate gold standard) and performance
analysis, the best performing method was the Longitudinal

101

Gamma Poisson Shrinker (LGPS) [14], which is an adaptation of a method used for signal detection in SRS, i.e. Gamma
Poisson Shrinker (GPS). LGPS estimates the age- and sexadjusted incidence rate ratios (RR) during the exposure of
interest against all other follow-up time (on other drugs and
off drugs) as reference while additionally applying Bayesian
shrinkage (RRLGPS) [14, 15]. All the drugs for which we
observed at least three exposed cases of ALI and with a lower
95 % CI of RRLGPS [1 were considered as potential signals
[16]. In a sensitivity analysis, we compared the risk estimates
derived from LGPS with the estimates from the self-controlled case series (SCCS) method. Confounding by indication (or contraindication) may arise when a drug treatment
serves as a marker for a clinical characteristic or medical
condition that triggers the use of the treatment and that, at the
same time, increases the risk of the outcome under study. In
SCCS analysis, cases serve as their own controls, thereby
allowing time-fixed confounding factors, known and
unknown (e.g. confounding by indication), to be controlled
for implicitly [14]. As in the main analysis, a drug–ALI
association was considered as statistically significant if the
lower 95 % CI of the RR, calculated using SCCS, was [1
with at least three exposed cases.
In addition, for each potential drug–ALI signal, we
evaluated the possible role of protopathic bias by applying
LEOPARD (Longitudinal Evaluation of Observational
Profiles of Adverse events Related to Drugs) [14]. Since
protopathic bias occurs when a drug is prescribed for an
early manifestation of a disease that has not yet been
diagnosed, the number of the specific drug prescriptions
initiated increases after the event date (relative to the
period prior to the event date), indicating that the drug is
used to treat prodromal symptoms of the event, rather than
cause it. Accordingly, for every suspect drug–ALI association, LEOPARD compared the prescription rates within a
fixed window of 25 days prior to and 25 days after the
occurrence of ALI. Thus, the method flagged the drug–ALI
associations as potentially due to protopathic bias if the
prescription rate after the event was higher than the prescription rate before the event [15].
For all signals that could not be explained by protopathic bias, based on current scientific evidence, we
assessed whether the association was known, unknown or
incompletely documented and we also evaluated the possible biological plausibility. For this purpose, we reviewed
primary drug-related information sources: (i) Micromedex
(http://www.thomsonhc.com/hcs/librarian) and (ii) the
summary of product characteristics (SPCs), derived from
the following two databases: (i) electronic Medicines
Compendium (eMC, http://www.medicines.org.uk/emc)
and (ii) FarmaDati (http://www.farmadati.it). With regard
to the SPCs, we specifically looked at the sections
‘Undesirable/adverse effects’ and ‘Special warnings and

precautions’. We additionally explored whether the drug–
ALI associations were already described in the published
literature (via MEDLINE: web.ebscohost.com) in adults
and/or more specifically in children.

3 Results
The paediatric population of the EU-ADR network overall
comprised 4,838,146 children and adolescents (aged

\18 years) contributing 25,575,132 PYs of follow-up in
the period 1996–2010. Among 1,015 potential cases of ALI
identified in this database network, 251 potential cases
(24.7 %) occurred during exposure to any drug (1,032,899
PY) accounting for a crude incidence of 2.4/10,000 PY
(2.1–2.7) among exposed.
The stepwise procedure leading to identification of
potential signals is schematically shown in Fig. 1. Of 2,170
drugs prescribed/dispensed to the paediatric population
during the study period, almost 6 % (N = 125) were

involved in at least one potential case of ALI. However,
only for 20 drugs were at least three exposed cases
observed across all databases (Table 1). Potential ALI
cases occurred most often during use of anti-infectives for
systemic use (N = 6) and drugs for alimentary tract and
metabolism (N = 5) (Table 1).
3.1 Detection of Statistically Significant Drug–ALI
Associations
The drugs that were associated with ALI, using unexposed
period to the drug of interest as reference, are shown in
Table 2. Ranked by the strength of the RRLGPS for ALI,
the top ten drugs included metoclopramide, methotrexate,
azathioprine, prednisolone, ranitidine, diclofenac, omeprazole, domperidone, phenoxymethylpenicillin, i.e. penicillin V, and human insulin. Applying the SCCS method,
most of these drugs remained significantly associated with
ALI, except for insulin, cefaclor and flunisolide. The
magnitude of risk decreased substantially for the anti-ulcer
drugs (ranitidine and omeprazole), the corticosteroids
(prednisolone and prednisone) and the immunosuppressants (azathioprine and methotrexate), pointing towards
confounding by indication. The association became
stronger for metoclopramide, domperidone, diclofenac,
valproic acid and erythromycin (Table 2). Notably, the
associations for insulin, cefaclor and flunisolide were not
confirmed using this method only because of lack of
power, although the potential risk remained high. Based
on the results derived from LEOPARD, ten of the drugs
with statistically significant associations using LGPS and
SCCS were classified as potentially due to protopathic
bias (Table 2).

3.2 Evaluation of the Significance and Novelty
of the Signals
Table 3 describes the available knowledge on the 20 statistically significant drug–ALI associations we observed.
Three associations were identified as a potentially new
signal (i.e. they had not been previously described in the
literature, either in adults or in children): domperidone,
human insulin and flunisolide. For these drugs, there is
currently no mention of ALI as a possible adverse event,
either in the SPCs or in the published literature, irrespective of the age group. In addition, two other drugs,
citalopram and cetirizine, have not thus far been described
as associated with hepatotoxicity in the paediatric population, although ALI has been documented in adults and is
reported in the SPCs.

4 Discussion
In this study, three previously undocumented signals of
ALI in children and adolescents were identified using ‘realworld’ data from a combination of multiple European
healthcare databases.
Among all the drugs being prescribed/dispensed in
children and adolescents during the study period, around
1 % (20/2,170) was potentially associated with ALI. ALI
occurred most frequently during use of antibacterial agents
and drugs for peptic ulcer and gastroesophageal reflux
disease. These data are very much in line with previous
findings from an analysis of the WHO SRS [1].
According to the definition of safety signals by Hauben
and Aronson [17], not all statistically significant

associations should be regarded as potential new signals.
To detect whether each drug–ALI association (i.e. possible
signal) was newly discovered, we performed a manual
review of the SPCs and other primary drug information
sources including Micromedex and MEDLINE and scientific literature. To the best of our knowledge, three of the
drug–ALI associations were not previously described in the
literature, either in adults or in children, and were also not
labeled in the SPCs. These drugs were domperidone, flunisolide and insulin (human). Two other drug–ALI associations (citalopram, cetirizine) were not previously
described in children but have already been described in
adults.
4.1 Potentially New Signals
The association between domperidone and ALI was identified as a potential new signal. However, prodromal signs/
symptoms of liver injury such as nausea and vomiting

represent the main indication for domperidone intake.
Therefore, although LEOPARD did not automatically flag
this as protopathic bias, we cannot exclude that this is a
spurious association due to protopathic bias. If indeed the
interval between incriminated prodromal symptoms and
onset of event is larger than 25 days, protopathic bias will
not be detected by LEOPARD [14].
Flunisolide is a synthetic inhaled corticosteroid with
potent topical anti-inflammatory activity, with an oral bioavailability ranging from 7 to 20 % [18, 19]. After gastrointestinal and lung absorption, the drug undergoes rapid and
extensive first-pass metabolism by the liver to an inactive
6-beta-hydroxylated metabolite. Systemic effects have not
been reported for the commonly used doses. Higher doses of
flunisolide, as well as the other inhaled corticosteroids, may
result in adverse events similar to those occurring during the
corticosteroid systemic use due to an increased oral
adsorption of the medicine. Although signs/symptoms of
liver injury are reported as undesirable side effects with the

106

use of all systemic corticosteroids, liver injury is not specifically mentioned for inhaled corticosteroids, including
flunisolide. Differences in pharmacokinetic characteristics
across inhaled corticosteroids might suggest differences in
the occurrence of adverse drug reactions [20]. Further
investigations comparing inhaled corticosteroids, specifically concerning hepatotoxicity, are required.
Insulin therapy is indicated in children and adolescents
with type 1 diabetes and in children with ketosis or diabetic
ketoacidosis when the distinction between type of diabetes
is unclear. There are no reports in the literature associating
human insulin with (acute) liver injury. However, it is
possible that insulin induces undesired weight gain from
hunger triggered by insulin-induced hypoglycemia. Comparative trials of patients with type 2 diabetes found that
weight gain and risk of hypoglycemia might occur during
the use of human insulin more than with the analogues [21,
22]. Moreover, weight gain could lead to hepatic steatosis,
an aetiopathologic sign of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease
(NAFLD), explaining the potential role of human insulin in
this type of liver injury [23]. On the other hand, since
NAFLD has been reported to increase the risk of type 2
diabetes [24], and potentially the use of insulin, the role of
insulin is unclear in this association.
The associations identified for flunisolide and human
insulin deserve a separate discussion because these associations were not confirmed by SCCS analysis, suggesting the
influence of potential confounder factors on the estimations.
This seems particularly true for insulin, for which the nature
(causal inference) of the connection to NAFLD remains a
matter of speculation [25]. However, although not significant (meaning that we had insufficient power for this statistical test only because of the low prevalence of exposure),
the associations were high for flunisolide (RRSCCS = 2.7)
and human insulin (RRSCCS = 4.1). Accordingly, we still
cannot rule out that these drugs are truly associated with an
increased risk of ALI and the associations of ALI, but these
drugs should be investigated in a formal pharmacoepidemiological study in a wider paediatric setting in order to
confirm or confute these potential signals.

Cetirizine is a second-generation antihistamine used for
the treatment of allergic rhinitis, angioedema and chronic
urticaria. Cetirizine and analogues have been related to
rare, isolated cases of clinically apparent ALI, with a pattern ranging from cholestatic hepatitis to hepatocellular
jaundice in adults [27–30]. Nevertheless, as urticaria may
represent a prodromic sign of underlying liver disease,
potential protopathic bias as an alternative explanation for
the association cannot be excluded and is supported by the
results from LEOPARD.
Although the association between ALI and metoclopramide has already been described in two epidemiologic
studies, including within the paediatric population, showing a risk of liver injury for metoclopramide ranging from
moderate to low [31, 32], we also believe that here, the
potential of protopathic bias holds similar to that described
for domperidone.
Finally, data mining on EHR databases detected associations for several drugs already widely known as hepatotoxic in both adults and children [33]. The application of
the LGPS as main analysis and the SCCS as sensitivity
analysis suggested that the system can produce reliable
results.
In fact, when applying the SCCS method, the associations from LGPS were amplified or reduced, but still
remained for all drugs already known to be hepatotoxic,
except for cefaclor. Similarly, using LEOPARD to filter
signals due to protopathic bias improved the overall performance of signal detection. LEOPARD flagged associations with anti-acid drugs, such as ranitidine or
omeprazole, as spurious. Indeed, these drugs might have
been prescribed for gastric discomfort, which is one of the
prodromal signs of hepatic injury. On the other hand, it was
rather unexpected that LEOPARD was not able to detect
this bias for metoclopramide or domperidone. This might
be explained by the ±25-day window that LEOPARD (by
default) applies as described above. Protopathic bias was
correctly captured for azathioprine, methotrexate, diclofenac and systemic corticosteroids. Indeed, these drugs are
prescribed for conditions (such as rheumatic disease)
associated with ALI.

4.2 Potentially New Signals in Paediatrics
4.3 Strengths and Limitations
Citalopram is a widely used selective serotonin reuptake
inhibitor (SSRI). Rare instances of acute, clinically
apparent episodes of liver injury with moderate or marked
liver enzyme elevations with or without jaundice have been
described in less than 1 % of adults within 6–10 weeks, or
earlier, of citalopram therapy. One prospective study
investigated the use of central nervous system (CNS)
agents and risk of idiosyncratic drug-induced liver injury in
children but did not identify citalopram as a suspect drug
[26].

The main strength of this study is its capability to (retrospectively) observe a large number of children and adolescents in a ‘real-world’ setting by combining data from
multiple longitudinal healthcare databases. While we were
able to investigate the associations between ALI and the
most frequently used drugs in children in Europe [34], the
system did not allow the exploration of over-the-counter
medications (such as paracetamol), in-hospital used drugs
or less frequently prescribed drugs (such as anti-

Signal Detection of Potentially Drug-Induced ALI in Children

tuberculosis agents and other anti-convulsants) that are
well known to be hepatotoxic in children. For instance, we
found a non-statistically significant increase in risk of ALI
related to the use of paracetamol, or anti-convulsants (i.e.
carbamazepine, phenobarbital, vigabatrin or gabapentin) or
other CNS agents (i.e. atomoxetine, risperidone, sertraline,
tramadol or methadone). This result does not imply the
absence of association, but rather the low prevalence of
exposure of these drugs in such prescribing/dispensing
registries.
We used harmonised database-specific disease codes
and free text search to automatically identify liver injury
from the database network. Individual causality assessment
of the identified associations was not conducted. However,
a previous study using a USA database network demonstrated that outcome misclassification does not influence
the results concerning signal detection [35]. Usually,
exclusion of alternative causes for the potential signal is
part of an aetiology-based approach for the evaluation of a
physician-reported ADR. To reproduce this process using
EHR databases, we used the SCCS method to control for
time-fixed confounders such as genetic factors, socio-economic status, individual frailty and severity of underlying
disease [14].
To investigate the potential of protopathic bias, we used
the LEOPARD method. Despite using filtering criteria for
significance and sensitivity analyses, the likelihood of
obtaining false-positive results cannot be excluded and
further validation of the newly identified associations needs
to be carried out [36].

5 Conclusions
We found potentially new signals concerning ALI for flunisolide, domperidone and insulin. There was also a signal
for ALI in children for citalopram and cetirizine, but this
association has already been described in adults. All
potentially new signals require further evaluation in
hypothesis-testing studies (e.g. formal pharmacoepidemiologic studies) to better account for bias and confounding.
Our findings highlight the potential of electronic healthcare
databases to complement traditional SRS for drug safety
signal detection and strengthening in a paediatric setting.
However, combining data from other longitudinal healthcare and paediatric-specific databases would be meaningful
to gain sufficient statistical power to investigate a large
range of drugs specifically used in children and
adolescents.
