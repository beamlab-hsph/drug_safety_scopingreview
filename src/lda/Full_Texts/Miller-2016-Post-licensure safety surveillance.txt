Abstract
Background: 23-Valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine, trade name Pneumovax®23
(PPSV23), has been used for decades in the Unites States and has an extensive clinical record.
However, limited post-licensure safety assessment has been conducted.
Objective: To analyze reports submitted to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System
(VAERS) following PPSV23 from 1990 to 2013 in order to characterize its safety profile.

Author Manuscript

Methods: We searched the VAERS database for US reports following PPSV23 for persons
vaccinated from 1990 to 2013. We assessed safety through: automated analysis of VAERS data,
crude adverse event (AE) reporting rates based on PPSV23 doses distributed in the US market,
clinical review of death reports and reports involving vaccine administered to pregnant women,
and empirical Bayesian data mining to assess for disproportional reporting.

Author Manuscript

Results: During the study period, VAERS received 25,168 PPSV23 reports; 92% were nonserious, 67% were in females and 86% were in adults aged ≥19 years. When PPSV23 was
administered alone, fever (43%), injection site erythema (28%) and injection site pain (25%) were
the most commonly reported non-serious AEs in children. Injection site erythema (32%), injection
site pain (27%) and injection site swelling (23%) were the most commonly reported non-serious
AEs in adults. Of serious reports (2129,8% of total), fever was most commonly reported in both
children (69%) and adults (39%). There were 66 reports of death, four in children and 62 in adults.
Clinical review of death reports did not reveal any concerning patterns that would suggest a causal
association with PPSV23. No disproportional reporting of unexpected AEs was observed in
empirical Bayesian data mining.

Introduction

Author Manuscript

The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) licensed 23-valent pneumococcal
polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23) (Pneumovax®23, Merck & Co, Inc., Whitehouse Station,
NJ) in 1983 [1]. PPSV23 replaced 14-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine. Another
licensed 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine, Pnu-Imune®23 (Wyeth Lederle),
was used from 1983 to 2002. Pneumovax®23 is the only licensed pneumococcal
polysaccharide vaccine currently available in the United States. The Advisory Committee on
Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends PPSV23 for individuals aged 2 through 64
years who are immunocompetent with chronic conditions, have functional or anatomic
asplenia or are immunocompromised; and for all adults aged >65 years regardless of
previous medical history [2–7]. Although no human or animal pre-licensure data are
available on the safety of PPSV23 in pregnancy [1], pregnancy is neither a contraindication
nor a precaution for vaccination [8]. In pre-licensure trials, the most frequently reported
adverse events (AEs) after PPSV23 included injection site reactions like pain, swelling and
redness at the injection site, and headache, fatigue, and myalgia. Injection site reactions were
higher in persons receiving a second dose of the vaccine compared to persons receiving the
first dose – pain was observed in 60% of primary vaccinations versus 77% of revaccinations,
injection site swelling or induration was reported in 20% versus 40%, and injection site
erythema was reported in 16% versus 35% respectively. Serious AEs were rare [1].

PPSV23 has been used for decades and has an extensive clinical record. However, limited
post-licensure safety assessment has been conducted [9–11]. We analyzed reports submitted
to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) following PPSV23 for the period
1990 through 2013.

Methods

Author Manuscript

VAERS is a national vaccine safety monitoring system jointly administered by the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the FDA that accepts spontaneous reports of
AEs following vaccination [12]. VAERS accepts reports from patients, parents, healthcare
providers, vaccine manufacturers, and others. The VAERS report form collects information
on the patient, vaccines administered and the AE experienced. Signs and symptoms of AEs
are coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA), a clinically
validated, internationally standardized terminology [13]. VAERS may also receive reports of
vaccination errors (e.g., incorrect dose administered) not describing an AE. A VAERS report
may be assigned one or more MedDRA preferred terms (PT). Reports are classified as
serious based on the Code of Federal Regulations if one or more of the following is reported:

death, life-threatening illness, hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, or
permanent disability [14]. For non-manufacturer serious reports, medical records are
routinely requested and made available to VAERS personnel; for reports of deaths, efforts
are made to obtain autopsy reports and death certificates to ascertain cause of death.
We analyzed the safety of PPSV23 using four methods: (1) automated analysis of VAERS
data, including comparisons of PPSV23 reports and trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine
(IIV3) reports, (2) crude AE reporting rates based on PPSV23 doses distributed in the US
market for all reports, serious reports, and reports of cellulitis and anaphylaxis, (3) clinical
review of death reports and reports involving vaccine administered to pregnant women, and
(4) empirical Bayesian (EB) data mining to assess for disproportional reporting of any AE
after PPSV23 compared to AEs after other vaccines in the VAERS database.

Automated analysis
We searched the VAERS database for US reports following brand name Pneumovax®23 for
persons vaccinated from January 1, 1990 through December 31, 2013, with a report receipt
date through January 31, 2014. We excluded foreign reports. We also excluded vaccine
brand name Pnu-1mune®23 reports since it was not the focus of our analysis. We included
reports of pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine with brand name not reported or unknown
that were received after 2002, since the only pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine available
in the US after 2002 was Pneumovax®23.

Author Manuscript

We analyzed reports by age, sex, “serious” status and most common MedDRA PTs. We also
compared PPSV23 reports to reports following IIV3 gathered using similar search criteria.
We summarized reports of anaphylaxis and cellulitis, and reports in which PPSV23 was
given during pregnancy. MedDRA PTs for anaphylaxis reports included: ‘anaphylactic
reaction’, ‘anaphylactic shock’, ‘anaphylactoid reaction’, or ‘anaphylactoid shock.’
MedDRA PTs for cellulitis included: ‘cellulitis’, ‘cellulitis staphylococcal’, ‘cellulitis
streptococcal’, ‘injection site cellulitis’, ‘vaccination site cellulitis’ or ‘post procedural
cellulitis.’ Pregnancy reports were identified using a combination of: (a) MedDRA PTs for
‘drug exposure during pregnancy’, ‘exposure during pregnancy’, or’ maternal exposure
during pregnancy’; (b) MedDRA System Organ Class groupings ‘pregnancy, puerperium
and perinatal conditions’, or ‘congenital, familial and genetic disorders’; and (c) a text string
search for “preg” in the fields for symptoms, pre-existing conditions and medical history.

Adverse event reporting rates

Author Manuscript

We calculated AE crude reporting rates for all reports and serious reports by dividing the
number of reports by PPSV23 vaccine doses distributed for the US market from 1990
through 2013. We also calculated crude reporting rates for anaphylaxis and cellulitis.
2.3.

Clinical review of death and pregnancy reports
We reviewed all death reports and accompanying medical records, autopsy reports and death
certificates when available to determine cause of death. Deaths were classified using
previously described body systems categories [15]. We also reviewed reports involving
vaccine administered to pregnant women.

Data mining

Author Manuscript

We performed disproportionality analysis using EB data mining [16] to identify AEs
reported more frequently than expected following PPSV23 compared to all other USlicensed vaccines. We used published criteria [17] to identify PPSV23–AE pairs reported at
least twice as frequently as expected (i.e., lower bound of the 90% confidence interval
surrounding the EB geometric mean [EB05 >2]). We reviewed reports with AEs that
exceeded this data mining threshold and were not already listed in the package insert as
known and expected AEs.
VAERS is a routine surveillance program conducted as a public health function and does not
meet the definition of research; therefore, it is not subject to Institutional Review Board
review and informed consent requirements.

Results
During the study period, VAERS received 25,168 PPSV23 reports (Table 1); 92% were nonserious, 67% were in females and 86% of were in adults aged ≥19 years. Healthcare
providers submitted 42% of reports. The percentages of serious reports were higher in
children aged 2–18 years compared to adults, but did not exceed 20% (Tables 2a and 2b).
Based on an estimate of just over 108 million PPSV23 doses distributed in the United States
from 1990 to 2013 (CDC unpublished data), the AE reporting rate for all reports was 23 per
100,000 doses distributed and for serious reports 2 per 100,000 doses distributed.

Author Manuscript

The most commonly reported AEs in children aged 2–18 years were pyrexia and various
injection site reactions (Table 3). PPSV23 was given alone in 45% of reports in this age
group. Among children who received other concomitant vaccines with PPSV23, 50%
received IIV3, 10% received diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis (DTaP) vaccine and 2%
received monovalent 2009-H1N1 pandemic influenza vaccine. The most commonly reported
AEs in adults aged ≥19 years were injection site erythema, injection site pain and pyrexia
(Table 4). PPSV23 was given alone in 52% of reports in adults. Among adults who received
other concomitant vaccines with PPSV23, 81% received IIV3.
When comparing PPSV23 reports to IIV3 reports when the vaccines were given alone, the
percent of serious reports in children was greater for PPSV23 than for IIV3: in children aged
2–5 years, 20% versus 9%; 6–12 years, 20% versus 7%; 13–18 years, 18% versus 10%.
However, in individuals aged ≥65 years, the percent of serious reports was greater for IIV3
compared to PPSV23,16% versus 8%.

Cellulitis and anaphylaxis reports
We identified 2725 reports of cellulitis, with 94% having onset within 7 days of vaccination.
The reporting rate for cellulitis was 2.5 per 100,000 PPSV23 doses distributed. In 43% of
the PPSV23 reports to VAERS, the vaccine dose number was not reported.
We also identified 62 reports of anaphylaxis, with all cases occurring either on the day of
vaccination (87%) or within one day of vaccination (10%), with the exception of one report
which stated the AE occurred within 4 days of vaccination. In one anaphylaxis report, the

onset interval could not be determined. The reporting rate for anaphylaxis was 0.06 per
100,000 (0.6 per million) PPSV23 doses distributed.
3.2.

Pregnancy reports
We identified 17 reports of women vaccinated with PPSV23 during pregnancy. Seven were
vaccinated in the first trimester; four were vaccinated in the second trimester, and in six
reports trimester was not stated. In six of the reports, the woman was known to be pregnant
at the time of vaccination; in the remaining reports, pregnancy status was unknown or
insufficient information was provided to determine if pregnancy status was known. AEs
included cellulitis (N = 5), injection site reactions (N = 5), gestational diabetes and
chlamydia (N = 1), spontaneous abortion (N = 2), and no AE documented (N =4).

3.3.

Deaths

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

We identified 66 reports of death following PPSV23 (Tables 2a and 2b); in one report age
was not included. Four deaths were reported in children aged 2–18 years. Causes of death
included Neisseria meningitides septicemia occurring 32 days after vaccination; accidental
asphyxiation in a child with a history of lissencephaly, microcephaly and seizure disorder
occurring 3 days after vaccination; and two cases of pneumococcal sepsis in children with
sickle cell disease occurring more than three years after vaccination. Sixty-one deaths were
reported in adults aged ≥19 years. Ages at time of death ranged from 27 to 98 years (median
69 years). The median time from vaccination to death was 32 days, with a range from the
day of vaccination to 1869 days (just over 5 years). Cause of death could not be confirmed in
17 adult reports due to lack of availability of medical records, death certificates or autopsy
reports. The most common causes of death among the 44 reports where records were
available included cardiovascular conditions (N =16), infections (N =9), and respiratory
conditions (N = 9). One reported death occurred the day of vaccination in a 50-year-old male
who had a prolonged and complicated hospitalization, with a diagnosis of metastatic renal
cell carcinoma and multiple abdominal surgeries. “Anaphylactic Shock” was listed on the
death certificate as the immediate cause of death and “Pneumococcal Polysaccharide
Vaccine (PPV) Administration” as an underlying cause.

Data mining

Author Manuscript

Disproportionality analysis detected EB05 >2 for the AEs: cellulitis, injection site cellulitis,
local reaction, skin warm, injected limb mobility decreased, skin striae, local swelling,
injection site streaking. These AEs are listed or are consistent with listed AEs in the PPSV23
package insert [1] and are not considered new safety concerns that warranted clinical review.
Routine laboratory-associated MedDRA terms consistent with testing or results withEB05
>2 included: ‘blood culture,’ ‘blood culture negative,’ ‘leuko-cytosis,’ and ‘white blood cell
count increased.’ Reports with the PTcodes ‘blood culture’ and ‘blood culture negative’
correlated with reports of fever (73%), white blood cell count increased (60%) and cellulitis
(46%).

Discussion
In our VAERS review of PPSV23, we found that fever and injection site reactions were the
most commonly reported AEs after PPSV23 in both children and adults. Cellulitis, an AE
that has been observed in the post-marketing experience and is listed in the package insert
[1,18,19], was a commonly reported serious AE. Cellulitis and cellulitis-like reactions can
be difficult to distinguish from local reactions that involve pain, swelling, erythema,
streaking and warmth, all of which occur after PPSV23. We did not detect any new or
unexpected safety concerns in our analysis of PPSV23 reports.

Author Manuscript

Injection site reactions are known to occur more frequently after revaccination than after the
initial dose [1,19]. In our data, 43% of PPSV23 reports did not include dose number. Prior
experience also indicates that dose number is inconsistently reported on the VAERS form for
many vaccines. Because of these limitations, we were not able to assess injection site
symptoms by PPSV23 dose number. PPSV23 can be administered by intramuscular or
subcutaneous injection [1]. There is evidence to suggest that the intramuscular route is
associated with less injection site reactions than the subcutaneous route [20–22]. However,
we are not able to compare AEs for intramuscular versus subcutaneous PPSV23
administration in VAERS due to data completeness and quality issues.

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

The AE reporting rate for all PPSV23 reports was 23 per 100,000 doses distributed and for
serious reports 2 per 100,000 doses distributed. This is higher than that observed in a review
of IIV3 reports to VAERS from 1990 to 2005, which showed a reporting rate of 2.44 per
100,000 doses administered for all reports and for serious reports 0.4 per 100,000 [23]. To
further evaluate differences between PPSV23 and IIV3 reports, we conducted post hoc
analysis that showed when the vaccines were administered alone, the percent of serious
reports in children was greater for PPSV23 compared to IIV3, but in individuals aged ≥65
years the percent of serious reports was greater for IIV3 compared to PPSV23. When
considering the recommendations for PPSV23 [2–7], these findings might be due to the
epidemiologic phenomenon of confounding by indication [24]. In children, PPSV23 is
recommended for those with certain chronic illnesses and functional or anatomic asplenia
(e.g., sickle cell disease, splenectomy); illnesses that are generally risk factors for significant
adverse health events. In contrast, annual seasonal influenza vaccination has been
recommended for all children regardless of health status [25]. For most of the study period,
in the elderly PPSV23 had generally been recommended as a onetime single dose for all
individuals at age 65 years [26], while annual seasonal influenza vaccination has been
recommended for all individuals aged ≥65 years [25]. The post hoc analysis also revealed
differences between the two vaccines in the distribution of reports within the ≥65 years old
age group, with the percent distribution of IIV3 reports weighted toward older individuals
within this elderly age group compared to PPSV23 reports, which conversely were weighted
toward younger individuals. Therefore, differences in percentage of serious reports between
PPSV23 and IIV3 might best be explained by the different indications and recommendations
for these vaccines.
We did not compare data for PPSV23 with the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) in
VAERS. During the study period, 1990–2013, PPSV23 and PCV were approved and

recommended for very different groups [2–4,26]. A comparison between PPSV23 and PCV
vaccines in VAERS would be confounded by indication and difficult to interpret.

Author Manuscript

Our specific reviews of anaphylaxis, pregnancy, and deaths found no concerning patterns.
Our reporting rate of anaphylaxis after PPSV23, 0.6 cases per million doses of vaccine
distributed, is lower than a published estimate of approximately 1 case per million doses of
any type of vaccine administered to children and adolescents [27]. This is reassuring;
however, under-reporting in VAERS likely explains the lower reporting rate observed [28].
Although PPSV23 is not specifically recommended for pregnant women, pregnancy is
neither a contraindication nor a precaution [8]; only 17 pregnancy-related reports were
submitted to VAERS during the study period. Most of these reported non-pregnancy-specific
AEs, such as injection site reactions, or no AE; there were only two reports of fetal demise,
both spontaneous abortions. For the four deaths reported in children, non-vaccine-related
causes were listed in the autopsy reports, death certificates, and/or medical records. Clinical
reviews of death reports did not reveal any concerning patterns that would suggest a causal
association with PPSV23 in children or adults. One death was attributed to anaphylaxis
following PPSV23, however, medical records indicate the patient had a complicated
hospitalization with a diagnosis of metastatic renal cell carcinoma and major abdominal
surgeries and died in the hospital shortly after receiving PPSV23. Our finding that few
deaths were reported after PPSV23, and the lack of causal association between vaccination
and deaths, is consistent with a larger study of death reports submitted to VAERS following
all vaccines. In that study, as in ours, causes of death were consistent with the most common
causes of death in the US population [29].

5.

Limitations

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Our study had several limitations. Although VAERS has broad national scope and the ability
to rapidly detect safety signals and rare adverse events, it is subject to the limitations of
spontaneous reporting systems, such as under-reporting, reporting biases, inconsistency in
quality and completeness of reports, and lack of an unvaccinated comparison group [12]. A
parent or patient may report the wrong vaccine (e.g., PPSV23 maybe reported when
pneumococcal conjugate vaccine or another vaccine was received), or may report
pneumococcal vaccine type unknown; in which case the vaccine was entered in VAERS as
PPSV23. Both of these situations could lead to misclassification of the vaccine. Generally,
we cannot determine if the reported AEs were causally related to receipt of PPSV23.
Furthermore, estimates of crude reporting rates using doses of PPSV23 vaccine distributed
as a denominator should be interpreted with caution, since the actual number of doses
administered and to whom those doses were administered are not known, and the rate of
underreporting is unknown. Despite these limitations, VAERS is a valuable monitoring
system to detect potential vaccine safety problems that might require further investigations
in more controlled studies. The present study detected no such concerns.

Conclusion
We did not identify any new or unexpected safety concerns in our study of PPSV23 reports
to VAERS from 1990 through 2013. Our findings from VAERS data are consistent with
findings from pre-licensure clinical trials [1] and other post-licensure studies [9–11,18,19].
