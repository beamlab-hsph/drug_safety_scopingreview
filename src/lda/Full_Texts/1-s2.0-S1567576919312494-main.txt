Backgrounds: Although myocarditis has been reported in patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors
(ICIs), there are few real-world studies to compare the occurrences and characteristics of myocarditis after
diﬀerent ICI regimens.
Methods: Disproportionality analysis and Bayesian analysis were utilized for data mining of the suspected adverse events of myocarditis after ICIs use based on the Food and Drug Administration's Adverse Event Reporting
System (FAERS) from January 2004 to June 2018. The times to onset and fatality rates of myocarditis following
diﬀerent ICI regimens were also compared.
Results: A total of 315 reports of myocarditis adverse events were identiﬁed with ICIs. Among 6 ICI monotherapies, avelumab had the highest association with myocarditis based on the highest reporting odds ratio
(ROR = 42.65, 95% two-sided CI = 15.86–114.72), proportional reporting ratio (PRR = 42.61, χ2 = 159.63)
and empirical Bayes geometric mean (EBGM = 41.87, 95% one-sided CI = 15.57). The combination therapies of
ipilimumab plus pembrolizumab or nivolumab had higher RORs, PRRs and EBGMs than did pembrolizumab or
nivolumab monotherapy. Myocarditis associated with the ipilimumab plus nivolumab treatment appeared to
have earlier onset (16.5 [IQR 14–29.75] days vs 32 [IQR 16–77] days, p < 0.01) and higher fatality rate (65.75%
vs 50.40%, p < 0.05) than that associated with nivolumab monotherapy.
Conclusions: Analysis of FAERS data provides more precise proﬁle on the occurrences and characteristics of
myocarditis after diﬀerent ICI regimens. The ﬁndings support continued surveillance, risk factor identiﬁcation,
and comparative studies.

1. Introduction
Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have transformed the landscape of cancer management [1]. To date, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved 6 ICIs for cancer therapy, including 1
cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4) inhibitor, ipilimumab; 2
programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) inhibitors, pembrolizumab and
nivolumab; and 3 programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitors,
atezolizumab, avelumab and durvalumab (Table 1). By releasing the
restrained antitumour immune responses, ICIs have demonstrated signiﬁcant eﬃcacy against a wide spectrum of cancers [2–5]. Moreover,
combination therapy of ipilimumab plus nivolumab has also been approved for several cancers with further reduction in mortality [6–8].
Clinical trials on novel ICIs and ICI combinations are still under way
[9,10].

⁎

Despite favourable beneﬁts, the use of ICIs is also accompanied by a
unique spectrum of side eﬀects, referred to as immune-related adverse
events (irAEs), which occur due to inﬂammatory reactions against
normal tissues. Common irAEs include dermatitis, endocrinopathies,
colitis, hepatitis, and pneumonitis [11]. Recently, cases of myocarditis
have been reported in cancer patients treated with ICIs [12–14]. Although recognized as an uncommon adverse reaction, ICI-related
myocarditis may result in poor outcomes, especially when these agents
are used in combination [15,16].
Although there is increasing evidence indicating that ICIs carry a
potential risk of myocarditis, most evidence comes from case reports
[12–16] or clinical trials [17,18], which is insuﬃcient to provide an
overview of the risk of rare adverse events such as myocarditis. Pharmacovigilance studies about this issue are still scarce and mainly focus
on toxicities between generations of ICIs or their combination [19,20].

Little is known about the accurate safety proﬁle of myocarditis after
each ICI regimen in clinical practice. Herein, we aimed to evaluate and
compare links between various ICI regimens and myocarditis in a large
real-world patient population by analysing adverse events in the FDA's
Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) until recently. In addition, we
further investigated the times to onset and fatality rates for myocarditis
after the administration of diﬀerent ICI regimens.
2. Material and methods

and with no other ICI in the same report as “second suspect”, “concomitant” or “interacting”. Combination therapy here was deﬁned as
concurrent administration of CTLA-4 inhibitor and PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitors which meant a speciﬁc ICI was “primary suspect”, and another
ICI was “second suspect”, “concomitant” or “interacting”. The time to
onset of myocarditis was evaluated for each ICI regimen. It was deﬁned
as the interval between the EVENT_DT (adverse event onset date) and
the START_DT (start date of ICIs use). However, reports with input error
(EVENT_DT earlier than START_DT) or inaccurate date entry were excluded. In addition, reports with fatal events attributed to drug toxicity
were counted, and the fatality rate was calculated as the number of fatal
events divided by the total number of events of myocarditis associated
with each ICI regimen.

2.1. Data source
We performed a retrospective pharmacovigilance study using data
from the FAERS database covering the period from January 2004 to
June 2018. The FAERS is a public voluntary spontaneous reporting
database that provides information on adverse event and medication
error reports submitted by health professionals, consumers, and manufacturers not only domestically but also from other countries. FAERS
data ﬁles contain demographic and administrative information
(DEMO), drug information (DRUG), the Medical Dictionary for
Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) preferred terms (PTs) coded for the
adverse event (REAC), patient outcomes (OUTC), report sources
(RPSR), therapy start dates and end dates for reported drugs (THER),
and indications for use (INDI).
In total, 9,354,226 reports were retrieved from the FAERS database.
A deduplication procedure was performed according to the FDA's recommendations, selecting the latest FDA_DT when the CASEIDs were
the same and selecting the higher PRIMARYID when the CASEID and
FDA_DT were the same, resulting in a reduction in the number of reports to 9,352,387.

2.4. Statistical analysis

Adverse events were investigated using the MedDRA term “myocarditis” in the REAC ﬁles. The drugs in the FAERS database can be
input arbitrarily; therefore, the MICROMEDEX® (Index Nominum) was
utilized as a dictionary for the ICIs (Table 1).

Descriptive analysis was used to summarize the clinical characteristics of the patients with ICI-associated myocarditis collected from the
FAERS database. The times to onset of ICI-associated myocarditis between diﬀerent ICI regimens were compared using non-parametric tests
(the Mann-Whitney test for dichotomous variables and the KruskalWallis test when there were more than two subgroups of respondents)
because the data were not normally distributed. Fatality rates were
compared between diﬀerent ICI regimens using Pearson's chi-square
test or Fisher exact test. The statistical signiﬁcance was determined at
p < 0.05 with 95% conﬁdence intervals. Data mining and all statistical
analyses were performed with SAS, version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary,
NC, USA).

2.3. Data mining

3. Results

Based on the disproportionality analysis and Bayesian analysis, we
used the reporting odds ratio (ROR), the proportional reporting ratio
(PRR), the Bayesian conﬁdence propagation neural network (BCPNN)
and the multi-item gamma Poisson shrinker (MGPS) algorithms to
identify an association between a drug and an adverse event.
The equations and criteria for the four algorithms [21–26] are
shown in Table 2. In this study, adverse events were extracted when at
least 1 of 4 indices met the criteria.
The associations between myocarditis and diﬀerent ICI regimens
(monotherapies and combination therapies) were compared.
Monotherapy here was deﬁned as a speciﬁc ICI used alone which meant
this speciﬁc ICI was “primary suspect” in ROLE_COD ﬁeld of DRUG ﬁles

3.1. Descriptive analysis

2.2. Adverse event and drug identiﬁcation

Overall, 43,147 adverse events related to ICIs and 4007 reports
related to myocarditis were documented in the FAERS database between January 2004 and June 2018. Among them, ICI therapy was
identiﬁed as the suspected drug causing myocarditis in 315 reports, and
the clinical characteristics of these patients are presented in Table 3.
The highest number of myocarditis reports was for nivolumab monotherapy (n = 125), followed by ipilimumab plus nivolumab combination therapy (n = 73). Myocarditis adverse events were most commonly
reported in patients with lung cancer (33.33%). The patients aﬀected
were more often males than females (58.41% vs 31.11%). The majority

have stronger associations with myocarditis than did pembrolizumab or
nivolumab alone based on higher RORs, PRRs and EBGMs. No cases
were reported for other combination therapies of anti-CTLA-4 plus
anti–PD-1/PD-L1.

Generally, the median time to event onset of ICI-related myocarditis
was 23 (inter-quartile range [IQR] 14–55) days. The times to onset
following each ICI regimen are shown in Fig. 1. Interestingly, it can be
seen from the data that the adverse event of myocarditis occurred as
soon as after the ﬁrst dose of several ICI monotherapies, including
pembrolizumab, nivolumab and atezolizumab, with median times to
onset of 22 (IQR 10.25–64) days, 32 (IQR 16–77) days, and 28 (IQR
8–89) days, respectively. There were no signiﬁcant diﬀerences in the
times to onset among these monotherapies (p = 0.215). However, patients treated with a combination of ipilimumab and nivolumab appeared to have earlier onset of myocarditis compared with that in those
receiving nivolumab alone (16.5 [IQR 14–29.75] vs 32 [IQR 16–77],
p = 0.005). Because there was only one report of myocarditis following
the ipilimumab plus pembrolizumab treatment available for the calculation of the time to onset, a comparison with pembrolizumab
monotherapy could not be made.

3.4. Fatality due to ICI-associated myocarditis
To determine the prognosis of myocarditis after ICIs use, we assessed the rates of fatality due to myocarditis adverse events following
various ICI regimens, and the results are shown in Fig. 2. It was observed that myocarditis generally portended poor outcomes with approximately half of cases (51.11%) resulting in death. Among the
monotherapies, nivolumab appeared to present the relatively high risk
of death, with 63 (50.40%) deaths among 125 cases, while atezolizumab appeared to have the relatively low risk of death, with 4
(22.22%) deaths among 18 cases. Fatal events also occurred in 3
(75.00%) of 4 patients with avelumab and 2 (66.67%) of 3 patients with
durvalumab, although the number of reports were not enough to draw a
conclusion. Based on the collected data, there was no signiﬁcant difference in fatality rates across diﬀerent ICI monotherapies (Fisher exact
test for overall comparison between ipilimumab, pembrolizumab, nivolumab, atezolizumab, avelumab and durvalumab, p = 0.184).
Among the combination therapies, more deaths occurred in myocarditis
cases with ipilimumab plus nivolumab combination than with nivolumab monotherapy (65.75% vs 50.40%, p = 0.036). As for the combination of ipilimumab plus pembrolizumab, there were only 4 myocarditis cases and no fatal event, while death occurred in 30 (43.48%)
of 69 patients with pembrolizumab used alone.

4. Discussion

of patients were ≥65 years (51.11%), with an average age of
66.26 ± 12.86 years for males and 64.69 ± 12.79 years for females.
Most of the cases were from Europe (40.63%) and the Americas
(40.32%) and were mainly submitted by health-care professionals
(79.37%). The number of ICI-related myocarditis reports increased
from 2012 to 2018.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst study to describe
diﬀerences in the associations, timing and prognosis of myocarditis
following the use of various ICI regimens in the real-world practice
based on the FAERS pharmacovigilance database, and it is the largest
collection of such cases to date. The study showed that all of the 6
studied ICIs were associated with adverse event of myocarditis, however, there were distinctions across regimens.
Ipilimumab, as the ﬁrst FDA approved ICI in 2011, demonstrate a
survival beneﬁt in patients with metastatic melanoma. It presented
uncommon cardiac adverse events in the early clinical trials, but notable cardiovascular toxicities, including fatal myocarditis, were reported post-marketing [12,19]. Then, pembrolizumab and nivolumab
were approved for the treatment of metastatic melanoma in 2014. In
both clinical trials and post-marketing surveillance, myocarditis associated with these two PD-1 inhibitors was noted as an adverse drug
reaction [18,27,28]. Cases of myocarditis were also found in patients

3.2. Disproportionality analysis and Bayesian analysis
Overall, based on the criteria for the 4 algorithms, myocarditis
signals were detected for all 6 ICI monotherapies and 2 ICI combination
therapies. The results are listed in Table 4. Among all ICI monotherapies, the association with myocarditis was noteworthy for avelumab because it had the highest ROR, PRR and EBGM, while ipilimumab appeared to have the relatively weaker associations with
myocarditis than others. Among the combinations of dual ICIs, the regimens of ipilimumab plus pembrolizumab or nivolumab were found to

Q. Fan, et al.

multicentre registry showed that the prevalence of myocarditis was
1.3% in patients receiving pembrolizumab alone and 0.6% in patients
receiving nivolumab alone and that the prevalence increased to 2.4% in
patients receiving anti-CTLA4/anti-PD1combined therapy [37]. In the
current study, when nivolumab or pembrolizumab was administered
concurrently with ipilimumab, stronger associations with myocarditis
were found than those with nivolumab or pembrolizumab treatment.
Although the true incidence rates need to be further investigated by a
well-designed clinical trial of diﬀerent ICI regimens, current results
indicated a higher risk of myocarditis reporting with the use of combined regimens.
Another important ﬁnding was that the median time to the onset of
myocarditis was 23 (IQR 14–55) days after the initiation of ICI treatment, which was earlier than the time to onset of 34 (IQR 21–75) days
reported in a cohort study by Mahmood et al. [37]. According to the
reports collected in this study, myocarditis could occur as soon as after
the ﬁrst dose for pembrolizumab, nivolumab and atezolizumab monotherapy. Besides, the nivolumab plus ipilimumab regimen was found to
result in an earlier occurrence of myocarditis than did nivolumab alone.
This ﬁnding is consistent with those of Johnson et al., who found the
median onset time of the nivolumab plus ipilimumab regimen was 17
(range 13–67) days. However, it is diﬃcult to determine the median
time to onset of myocarditis after the initiation of ipilimumab plus
pembrolizumab combination therapy due to quite limited report
available for time calculation in the FAERS database, and that may be
partly because this combined therapy has not been approved by the
FDA for wide application and is still in the clinical trial stage [9,10].
Further surveillance about new ICI regimens is needed.
To further investigate diﬀerences in the severity of myocarditis associated with ICIs, the rates of fatality due to myocarditis following
various ICI regimens were assessed and compared. It was observed that
myocarditis generally portended poor outcomes with approximately
half of cases (51.11%) resulting in death. With respect to monotherapy,
nivolumab appeared to present the relatively high fatality rate
(50.40%), while atezolizumab appeared to have the relatively low
fatality rate (22.22%). The risk of fatality was higher in patients who
developed myocarditis after receiving ipilimumab plus nivolumab
combination therapy than in those who received nivolumab monotherapy (65.75% vs 50.40%, p = 0.036), which is in line with the results of previously published case series that also reported more frequent death due to myocarditis associated with 2-ICI regimen
[15,37,45]. Based on the study by Salem et al., ICI combination therapy
was the only fatality-related risk factor for ICI-associated myocarditis
[34]. However, it is diﬃcult to accurately determine the risk of death
due to the use of avelumab or durvalumab monotherapy as well as the
ipilimumab plus pembrolizumab combination therapy, because only 3
or 4 available reports were collected for each regimen, and the continued surveillance is needed.
As the application of immune therapies continues to rise in oncology, it is necessary for practising clinicians to be vigilant for ICIassociated myocarditis and the diﬀerent characteristics of that myocarditis across ICI regimens. Early screening is encouraged to be applied
to patients with risk factors, at least when the use of combination
therapy is intended [19]. The present ﬁndings need to be considered in
clinical decisions on ICI treatment and in further clinical trials regarding various ICI regimens.
Although the data mining techniques used in this study have many
advantages, it should be noted that this method cannot solve all the
problems with the detection and analysis of adverse drug reaction
signals based on spontaneous reporting systems. Therefore, unavoidably, this study has certain limitations. First, data mining technology cannot remedy the inherent limitations of SRSs, such as underreporting, false reporting, incomplete reporting, inaccuracy and
arbitrariness, all of which might result in reporting bias. Second, SRSs
are only used in qualitative research and cannot quantify the adverse
reaction signals of myocarditis based on the total number of adverse

treated with other ICIs, such as avelumab [29], atezolizumab [30] and
durvalumab [31]. As the combination of CTLA-4 and PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors manifested further clinical beneﬁts, dual ICIs given in a concurrent regimen were applied for the treatment of many cancers. After
Johnson et al.'s report about fulminant myocarditis associated with this
2-drug regimen [15], the risk of severe myocarditis induced by ICI
combination therapy has attracted a great deal of attention. However,
the assessment and characterization of ICI-associated myocarditis is
quite challenging because of its low incidence and various manifestations. Hence, it is important to recognize the associations of particular
ICI regimens with myocarditis as well as the clinical features, and to
develop awareness of the possibility of this adverse event among oncologists, cardiologists, emergency department physicians, pharmacists
and other specialists.
Although clinical trials are mandatory to establish eﬃcacy for novel
drugs, there are limitations on the ability to draw deﬁnitive conclusions
about drug safety due to the strict study entry criteria, relatively small
sample sizes, ﬁnite scope and time frame. Nevertheless, spontaneous
reporting systems (SRSs) can serve as a primary source of post-marketing data and play an important role in the detection of safety issues,
including ICI-related irAEs [32,33]. According to our study based on
the FAERS, a substantial increase in reporting incidence over time,
especially in the ﬁrst half of 2018. It is speculated that this may due to
rapid expanding of varieties and indications of ICIs as well as heightened recognition of this new clinical entity [20]. ICI-associated myocarditis seemed to predominately aﬀect men (58.41%), which conﬁrmed the ﬁndings of Salem et al. who also found such adverse events
occurred mainly in men (67%) based on the data from VigiBase [34].
However, it should be noted that there were inadequate inclusion of
women in both clinical trials and clinical practice for ICI treatment
because of higher risk of autoimmune diseases that women carry
[35,36]. Therefore, further research is required to provide evidence of
the true incidence of ICI-associated myocarditis among men and
women. The current study also indicated that ICI-related myocarditis
was mainly detected in elderly patients (51.11% ≥65 years vs
27.94% < 65 years), which has similarity with conclusions of the
multicentre observational study by Mahmood et al. [37]. As is known,
advancing age is an important risk factor for cancer [38]. Data from the
Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program 2012–2016 reveals that the median age at diagnosis across all cancer types is
66 years, with > 50% of new cancer cases being diagnosed in patients
65 years or older [39]. However, evidence of the safety of ICI treatment
in elderly adults is still limited because of inadequate enrolment in
clinical trials. Most immunotherapy clinical trials included approximately 20%–40% patients above the age of 65 years [40]. While, the
wide use of ICIs in cancer patients over 65 years in the real-world setting has been observed in several recent retrospective studies [41,42].
Unfortunately, it is diﬃcult to control such confounding factor as age in
this study because of the limitation of FAERS database. Further research
is needed to explore the link between advanced age and incidence of
ICI-related myocarditis. Even so, our results suggested that more attention should be paid to elderly patients, which is also emphasized in
the 2017 Chinese Lung Cancer Summit expert panel [43].
Using pharmacovigilance analysis, all ICIs were found to be associated with myocarditis, and therefore this appears to be a class eﬀect.
Surprisingly, avelumab seems to have the strongest association with
myocarditis among all ICI monotherapies, which has not been reported
previously. Regarding the increased risk of myocarditis caused by ICI
combinations, there are contrasting reports on the incidence rates.
According to the study by Sznol et al., no occurrence of myocarditis was
identiﬁed after a pooled analysis of 448 patients administered the
combination therapy of ipilimumab plus nivolumab [44]. Conversely,
Johnson et al. proposed that patients who received combined ipilimumab and nivolumab therapy developed myocarditis more frequently
than those who received nivolumab alone (0.27% vs. 0.06%;
p < 0.001) [15]. Another cohort study of 964 patients from a

reactions and cannot calculate the incidence of ICI-associated myocarditis. Due to a lack of information in the FAERS database, it is difﬁcult to control for confounding factors such as age, indication for drug
use, pre-existing cardiovascular diseases, comorbidities or other factors
that might have an impact on the myocarditis risk. Third, although data
mining techniques can provide a proﬁle of ICI-associated myocarditis
through signal detection, it in itself is generally insuﬃcient to prove a
causal relationship. While pharmacovigilance studies using the FAERS
database have limitations, as mentioned above, they are able to identify
signals between ICI regimens and myocarditis, which provides clues for
further well-organized clinical studies with respect to ICI-associated
myocarditis.

5. Conclusions
Our analysis of the FAERS database identiﬁed signals for myocarditis associated with various ICI regimens in real-world practice. The
clearest ﬁnding to emerge from this study is that avelumab was noteworthy for its relatively stronger association with myocarditis than
other ICI monotherapies, while combined ICI regimens presented
stronger associations with myocarditis than did monotherapies.
Moreover, myocarditis associated with the ipilimumab plus nivolumab
treatment appeared to have earlier onset and higher fatality rate than
those associated with nivolumab monotherapy. Further pharmacoepidemiological studies are required to test the hypotheses generated by
this study. Our ﬁndings provide a foundation for continued surveillance
and investigation into this matter.
