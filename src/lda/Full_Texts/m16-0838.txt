Patient Outcomes
A Cohort Study
Huabing Zhang, MD; Jorge Plutzky, MD; Maria Shubina, ScD; and Alexander Turchin, MD, MS

Background: Many patients discontinue statin treatment, often
after having a possible adverse reaction. The risks and beneﬁts
of continued statin therapy after an adverse reaction are not
known.
Objective: To examine the relationship between continuation
of statin therapy (any prescription within 12 months after an adverse reaction) and clinical outcomes.
Design: Retrospective cohort study.
Setting: Primary care practices afﬁliated with 2 academic medical centers.
Participants: Patients with a presumed adverse reaction to a
statin between 2000 and 2011.
Measurements: Information on adverse reactions to statins
was obtained from structured electronic medical record data or
natural-language processing of narrative provider notes. The primary composite outcome was time to a cardiovascular event
(myocardial infarction or stroke) or death.

prescriptions after the adverse reaction. Four years after the presumed adverse event, the cumulative incidence of the composite primary outcome was 12.2% for patients with continued statin
prescriptions, compared with 13.9% for those without them (difference, 1.7% [95% CI, 0.8% to 2.7%]; P < 0.001). In a secondary
analysis of 7604 patients for whom a different statin was prescribed after the adverse reaction, 2014 (26.5%) had a documented adverse reaction to the second statin, but 1696 (84.2%)
of those patients continued receiving statin prescriptions.
Limitations: The risk for recurrent adverse reactions to statins
could not be established for the entire sample. It was also not
possible to determine whether patients actually took the statins.
Conclusion: Continued statin prescriptions after an adverse reaction were associated with a lower incidence of death and cardiovascular events.

continued statin therapy after an adverse reaction is as
beneﬁcial as statin treatment in patients who tolerate
these medications well. Improving our understanding
of the beneﬁts and risks of continuing statin treatment
after an initial adverse reaction is critical to helping patients and their clinicians make informed decisions regarding statin management.
Data are lacking on this topic, likely because adverse reactions frequently are recorded only in narrative documents (20). We used validated naturallanguage processing software (20) in an electronic
medical record (EMR) as a unique tool that allowed us
to test the hypothesis that patients who continue statin
therapy after a reported adverse reaction can do so
safely and with a lower risk for future cardiovascular
events and death.

tatins have established beneﬁcial effects on reducing mortality and cardiovascular events in patients
at high cardiovascular risk (1–3). Although recent
guidelines strongly recommend statin use for secondary prevention and widely advocate it for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease (4), statin therapy is
commonly discontinued (5, 6). Studies reveal that 25%
to 50% of patients stop taking statins within 6 months
to a year after the initial prescription, and after 2 years,
the discontinuation rate is as high as 75% (6 –10). Discontinuation has been linked to increased risk for
cardiovascular events and death (6, 11–13). Adverse reactions, such as myalgia and gastrointestinal or neurologic symptoms, may be important contributors to discontinuation of statin therapy (14 –16).
Previous studies suggest that many reported adverse reactions are not actually caused by statins and
that most patients rechallenged with statins after an adverse reaction can tolerate these drugs long term (5,
17, 18). However, many patients do not reattempt statin
therapy and remain without treatment for prolonged
periods, if not indeﬁnitely (5). Furthermore, statin therapy frequently is restarted at a lower dosage after an
adverse reaction, and the dosage may not be increased. Patients also may be less adherent to therapy,
fearing recurrence of the adverse reaction (17, 19).
Consequently, uncertainty exists regarding whether

METHODS
Design
We conducted a retrospective cohort study to investigate the relationship between continued statin
prescriptions during a 12-month period after a presumed adverse reaction to a statin and subsequent cardiovascular events (myocardial infarction [MI] and
stroke) or death from any cause.
Study Cohort
Study participants included adults (aged 18 years
and older) who were receiving statin prescriptions and
being seen by primary care providers afﬁliated with
Brigham and Women's Hospital or Massachusetts General Hospital between 2000 and 2011. Participants had
to have had an adverse reaction that was presumed to
have been caused by a statin and documented by a
provider (of any specialty) in the EMR between 1 January 2000 and 31 December 2011 (sample identiﬁcation
period; see Supplement Figure 1, available at Annals
.org). The index date was deﬁned as the date of the ﬁrst
documented adverse reaction to a statin.
Information on presumed adverse reactions to
statins was obtained from a combination of structured
EMR data and computational analysis of narrative electronic provider notes by using natural-language processing software. The software was speciﬁcally validated for identiﬁcation of adverse reactions to statins,
achieving a sensitivity of at least 86.5% and a positive
predictive value of at least 91.9% in chart reviews (20).
Determining whether the statin actually caused the reported adverse reaction was not possible, and the literature suggests that not all symptoms believed to be the
result of statins are actually caused by them (5, 17, 18,
21). Thus, we use the term presumed adverse reactions
to describe the statin-related adverse events documented in the EMR. Presumed adverse reactions were
classiﬁed according to the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). Patients were excluded if
they had a previous adverse reaction to a statin, had
missing demographic information, or were not followed before the ﬁrst documentation of an adverse reaction (potentially leading to missing baseline data).
Whether statin prescriptions were continued was
determined during the 12 months after the adverse reaction (treatment assessment period); patients were
excluded if they were not followed in a primary care
practice for this entire period. Continuation of statin
prescriptions was ascertained before the follow-up period began (for outcome assessment). Patients were followed until the end of a 12-month period beginning
after the last primary care note, an outcome event, or
the end of the study period (31 December 2013),
whichever occurred ﬁrst. This study was approved by
the institutional review board at the Partners HealthCare System with a waiver of written informed consent.
Study Measurements
Demographic, medication, and laboratory data
were obtained from the EMR at Partners HealthCare
System, an integrated health care delivery network in
222 Annals of Internal Medicine • Vol. 167 No. 4 • 15 August 2017

Statin Continuation After Adverse Reactions and Outcomes

eastern Massachusetts that includes Brigham and
Women's Hospital and Massachusetts General Hospital
(for details, see the Supplement, available at Annals
.org). No changes pertinent to the subject of this study
were made to the EMR during the study period. Patients were categorized as continuing to receive statin
prescriptions if they received another prescription for
any statin during the treatment assessment period. Patients who did not receive statin prescriptions after the
adverse reaction served as the comparison group.
Patient age was calculated at the index date. Diagnoses of coronary artery disease (CAD), MI, stroke, or
diabetes mellitus (DM); family history of CAD and
stroke; and smoking status were obtained from the
EMR data before the index date. Highest low-density
lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) level was deﬁned as the
highest level recorded before the study exit. Estimated
glomerular ﬁltration rate (eGFR) was calculated by using the Modiﬁcation of Diet in Renal Disease formula
(22). Baseline body mass index (BMI), blood pressure,
and eGFR were calculated as the average value in the
12 months before the index date because of the relatively high volatility of these measures. Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) score was calculated at the index
date. Coronary artery disease, stroke, diabetes, and
chronic kidney disease were excluded from the CCI calculation because they were already included in the
analysis as individual variables. Patients were categorized as having been evaluated by a cardiologist if they
had at least 1 note in a cardiology clinic within the Partners HealthCare System during the 12 months after the
presumed adverse reaction to a statin.
The composite primary outcome was time to the
ﬁrst of the following events: MI, stroke, or death from
any cause. Time to death from any cause and time to
the ﬁrst cardiovascular event (MI or stroke) served as
secondary outcomes. Date of death was identiﬁed by
using the Social Security Administration's Death Master
File. Cardiovascular events were ascertained from administrative data by using International Classiﬁcation of
Diseases, Ninth Revision, codes. Time to all outcomes
was calculated starting at 12 months after the presumed adverse reaction.
Statistical Analysis
An individual patient served as the unit of analysis.
Summary statistics were calculated by using frequencies and proportions for categorical data and means
(SDs), medians, and ranges for continuous variables.
Baseline characteristics of patients with and without
continued statin prescriptions were compared by using
t and chi-square tests. Cox multivariable proportional
hazards models were constructed to estimate the association between continued statin prescriptions and patient outcomes. The models were stratiﬁed by age
(<50, 50 to 59, 60 to 69, 70 to 79, 80 to 89, and >90
years) and included patient demographics (sex, race,
median income by ZIP code, marriage, health insurance, and primary language); smoking status; CCI
score; history of CAD, stroke, and DM; family history of
CAD and stroke; evaluation by a cardiologist; baseline

systolic and diastolic blood pressure and BMI; maximum LDL-C level; and log(eGFR) as covariates. The
proportional hazards assumption was evaluated by using the cumulative martingale residual approach (23).
Competing risk analysis also was used to evaluate time
to the ﬁrst cardiovascular event (24). Both comparisons
of baseline patient characteristics and Cox multivariable analyses were adjusted for multiple testing by using the Simes–Hochberg method (25, 26).
Inverse probability weighting (27–29) was used to
construct adjusted Kaplan–Meier plots that were
compared by using weighted log-rank tests. Inverse
probability–weighted Kaplan–Meier estimates are presented at 4 years as adjusted cumulative incidence. The
inverse probability weighting approach adjusts for imbalance due to measured confounders by weighting
patients in each treatment group (continued vs. discontinued statin prescriptions) so that the weighted sample
for each group represents the entire patient sample.
The probability of treatment group assignment was estimated by using a propensity score approach (for details, see the Supplement and Supplement Table 1,
available at Annals.org) (30). Multiple imputation was
used to account for missing data (baseline systolic and

diastolic blood pressure, BMI, maximum LDL-C level,
and eGFR) in the Cox proportional hazards models and
the propensity score estimation (31).
We conducted sensitivity analyses to assess
whether patients' cardiovascular risk, intensity of statin
therapy, length of treatment assessment period, or
change of statin after the adverse reaction affected the
relationship between continued statin prescriptions
and the primary outcome (for details, see the Supplement). We also conducted a sensitivity analysis to quantify the strength of the association of a hypothetical unmeasured binary confounder that would be required to
eliminate a statistically signiﬁcant association (32). All
data were analyzed by using SAS, version 9.4 (SAS Institute), and R, version 3.11 (R Foundation for Statistical
Computing) (sensitivity analysis for unmeasured
confounding).

RESULTS
Study Cohort
Of 201 645 adults receiving statin prescriptions between 1 January 2000 and 31 December 2011, 44 940
had at least 1 presumed adverse reaction to a statin
documented in the EMR. Of these patients, 28 266
were included in the study (Supplement Figure 2, available at Annals.org); after the presumed adverse reaction, 19 989 patients (70.7%) continued to receive statin
prescriptions and 8277 did not. Most adverse reactions
(80.9%) were identiﬁed solely from the text of narrative
EMR provider notes, 10.8% were identiﬁed solely from
the structured EMR data, and 8.3% were found in both
data sources. The distribution of the adverse event's
source differed between patients who continued to receive statin prescriptions and those who did not (Supplement Table 2, available at Annals.org). A plurality of
patients (12 385 or 43.8%) continued receiving the
same statin, but many (7604 or 26.9%) changed to a
different medication (Supplement Figure 3, available at
Annals.org). The patients who continued to receive
statin prescriptions were more likely to be older and
have a higher income, government insurance, a history
of CAD and DM, a family history of CAD, an evaluation
by a cardiologist, lower diastolic blood pressure, a
higher BMI, and a lower LDL-C level (Table 1). Myalgia
or myopathy and hepatobiliary and other gastrointestinal disorders were among the most common categories of adverse reactions (Table 2).
Patients were followed for a mean of 4.4 years. During that time, 3677 patients (13.0%) reached the composite primary outcome, whereas 1872 patients (6.6%)
died and 2332 (8.3%) had a cardiovascular event. Of
the patients who reached the composite outcome,
1203 (14.5%) did not receive statin prescriptions after
the adverse reaction, whereas 2474 (12.4%) did.
Multivariable Analysis
Four years after the presumed adverse reaction, inverse probability–weighted cumulative incidence of the
composite primary outcome was 12.2% for patients
with and 13.9% for those without continued statin pre224 Annals of Internal Medicine • Vol. 167 No. 4 • 15 August 2017

scriptions (difference, 1.7% [95% CI, 0.8% to 2.7%]; P <
0.001) (Figure). Similarly, after 4 years of follow-up,
5.4% of patients with and 6.6% of those without continued statin prescriptions died (difference, 1.2% [CI, 0.6%
to 1.9%]; P < 0.001), and 7.6% of patients with and 8.5%
of those without continued statin prescriptions had a
cardiovascular event (difference, 0.9% [CI, 0.1% to
1.7%]; P = 0.024).
In Cox multivariable analysis, continued statin prescriptions were associated with a hazard ratio (HR) of
0.87 (CI, 0.81 to 0.93; P < 0.001) for the composite
primary outcome (Supplement Table 3A, available at
Annals.org), 0.79 (CI, 0.72 to 0.87; P < 0.001) for death
(Supplement Table 3B, available at Annals.org), and
0.92 (CI, 0.84 to 1.00; P = 0.054) for cardiovascular
events (Supplement Table 3C, available at Annals.org).
Sensitivity analysis for time to cardiovascular event adjusted for competing risk for death showed similar results (HR, 0.92 [CI, 0.84 to 1.01]; P = 0.083). Female sex
and higher eGFR were associated with lower risk for
both cardiovascular outcomes and death, whereas current smoking; higher CCI score; and a history of CAD,
stroke, or DM were associated with higher risk.
Secondary and Sensitivity Analyses
Recurrent adverse reactions to statins could not be
established for the entire study cohort, because the
timing of the adverse reaction is not always documented in the EMR clearly enough to distinguish a recurrent adverse reaction from the initial reaction. We
therefore assessed recurrent adverse reactions in a secondary analysis limited to patients who received a different statin prescription after the ﬁrst presumed adverse reaction. In this subgroup of 7604 patients, 2014
(26.5%) subsequently had an adverse reaction documented in the EMR that was attributed to the second
statin (that is, recurrent). Most of these patients (1696,
or 84.2%) continued to receive statin prescriptions (for
the same or a different agent). Of the 7604 patients for
whom a different statin was prescribed, 903 (11.9%)
reached the composite primary end point, compared
with 1203 of 8277 patients (14.5%) who did not conAnnals.org

tinue receiving statin prescriptions (HR, 0.90 [CI, 0.82 to
0.99]; P = 0.024).
A subgroup analysis by cardiovascular risk found
an HR for the primary outcome of 0.84 (CI, 0.77 to 0.92;
P < 0.001) in patients with a baseline history of CAD,
stroke, or diabetes and 0.87 (CI, 0.77 to 0.97; P =
0.012) in patients without these conditions. In multivariable analysis using an 18-month (rather than a 12month) treatment assessment period, the HR for the
primary outcome was 0.89 (CI, 0.82 to 0.97; P = 0.005).
When a variable representing the intensity of continuing statin prescriptions (high vs. low dose) was included
in our analysis models, it was not associated with a difference in risk for the composite primary outcome.
Our ﬁnding of decreased hazard for the composite
outcome among patients who continued receiving
statin prescriptions may have resulted from an unmeasured confounder that decreased the hazard for this
outcome and had greater prevalence among patients
who continued statin therapy than those who did not.
Assuming a degree of association similar to that observed among measured covariates (HR, 0.75), we calculated that an unmeasured binary confounder would
need to be at least 22.6% more prevalent among patients who continued statin therapy to explain our main
ﬁndings (Supplement Table 4B, available at Annals
.org). A stronger confounder with an HR of 0.50 (Supplement Table 4A, available at Annals.org) would need
to be at least 7.5% more prevalent in patients continuing statin therapy. For a normally distributed confounder with unit standard deviation in each comparison group and an HR of 0.60, the difference of
confounder means would have to be at least 0.144 to
explain our main result.

DISCUSSION
Although randomized controlled trials suggest that
statins are associated with only a slight increase in adverse reactions and no increase in discontinuation of
treatment compared with placebo (33, 34), observational studies performed in routine clinical practice
paint a different picture, reporting adverse reaction
rates as high as 20% (5, 15, 35). These reactions are
considered an important contributor to discontinuation
of statin therapy (14 –16), and optimal clinical management of discontinuation after an adverse reaction remains uncertain. Options include a rechallenge (possibly with a different statin or the same statin at a lower
dosage) and prescription of a lipid-lowering medication from a different class (such as a PCSK9 or cholesterol absorption inhibitor). Despite the potential effect
of these different choices, data are lacking regarding
outcomes related to either option.
Our ﬁndings indicate that 30% of patients did not
receive statin prescriptions after a presumed adverse
event. We also found that patients who continued to
receive statin prescriptions had a 10% to 20% lower
incidence of both cardiovascular events and death
from any cause. This ﬁnding is consistent with results of
clinical trials showing that statin treatment reduces allAnnals.org

an adverse reaction showed a trend toward lower allcause mortality (cardiovascular events were not examined) (17), it included only 1605 patients and likely was
underpowered.
Continued use of statins after an adverse reaction
may not be the optimal choice for everyone. Providers
should follow a patient-centered approach and engage
in a balanced discussion with patients about the risks
and beneﬁts of continuing this therapy. Our data indicate that clinicians and patients may be following this
paradigm to some extent. Patients at higher cardiovascular risk, as evidenced by personal or family history of
CAD, diabetes, or obesity, were more likely to continue
receiving statin prescriptions after an adverse reaction.
Our main analyses adjusted for cardiovascular risk factors; yet even without this adjustment, continued statin
prescriptions were associated with a lower risk for both
cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality. Furthermore, provider specialty seemed to play as strong a
role as the patient's risk factors: Evaluation by a cardiologist was highly associated with continued statin prescriptions among patients with a presumed statinrelated adverse reaction.
One obvious risk of continued statin therapy in patients with a presumed adverse reaction to statins is the
possibility of a recurrent adverse reaction. Our analysis
estimated the rate of such reactions (to the second
statin) at 26.5%, which is high but comparable to the
baseline rate of 18.7%. Notably, more than 80% of patients who had a documented recurrent adverse reaction subsequently continued receiving statin prescriptions, suggesting that the symptoms were mild or
tolerable. Both the absolute risk and symptom severity
must be weighed against the potential beneﬁts of continuing statin therapy after a presumed adverse reaction.
Another important consideration is that in patients
with low cardiovascular risk, treatment with statins, especially after a possible adverse reaction, may not be
appropriate. The most recent guidelines recommend
statins for most patients with a 10-year cardiovascular
risk of 7.5% or greater (4). In our analysis, we found a
reduction in risk for cardiovascular events and death
associated with continued statin prescriptions among
high- and lower-risk patients. However, the patients included in our study were a high-risk group on average,
with a rate of combined cardiovascular events or death
of more than 20% over 10 years. Future studies should
be conducted to establish the cardiovascular risk
threshold below which a statin rechallenge after an adverse reaction may be more harmful than beneﬁcial for
the patient.
The present study has several strengths. Access to
EMR data from 2 large hospital systems allowed us to
analyze longitudinal data with an average follow-up of
more than 4 years from nearly 30 000 patients with diverse backgrounds. Our use of specially designed
natural-language processing software gave us the
unique ability to identify many reported adverse reactions
to statins that were documented only in provider notes (5,
20).

Statin Continuation After Adverse Reactions and Outcomes

Our study has several limitations, however. The
population was drawn from 2 academic medical centers in Massachusetts, limiting generalizability, and it is
retrospective and involves data collected in the course
of routine care. Thus, we could establish only associations rather than causal relationships. We had information only on statin prescriptions and could not assess
whether patients actually took their medications. Most
(81%) of the information on statin adverse reactions
was obtained from processing narrative EMR notes. We
also could not ascertain the timing, severity, or speciﬁc
causes (for example, drug– drug interaction) of the adverse reactions. A moderate unmeasured confounder
might explain the observed association. Finally, we did
not have information on patient or provider preferences regarding continuation of statin therapy after an
adverse reaction, and cause-of-death information was
not available.
Our ﬁndings suggest that continued statin prescriptions were associated with a reduced incidence of
cardiovascular events and death among patients who
had EMR documentation of a presumed adverse reaction. Whether therapy should be continued after an adverse reaction is an important decision that must take
into account the balance of potential beneﬁts and risks
to the patient. This study's ﬁndings may help patients
and their clinicians inform their choice of treatment to
best ﬁt each patient's circumstances.
