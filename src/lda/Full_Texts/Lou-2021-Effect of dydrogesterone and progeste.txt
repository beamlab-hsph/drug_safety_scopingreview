Abstract: Objective: To investigate the efficacy and safety of dydrogesterone and progesterone in the treatment of
threatened miscarriage due to corpus luteum insufficiency. Methods: A prospective cohort study was designed and
a total of 1,285 patients with threatened miscarriage due to corpus luteum insufficiency were recruited, in which
665 participants received dydrogesterone treatment (dydrogesterone group), and the other 620 received progesterone treatment (progesterone group). The time for clinical symptom relief, changes of sex hormone levels in serum,
the rate of miscarriage prevention, delivery outcome, and adverse effects were compared between the two groups.
XGBoost algorithm was applied to analyze the factors impacting the efficacy and safety of each treatment. Results:
There was no significant difference regarding the time for clinical symptom relief and the rate of miscarriage prevention between the two groups (P>0.05, RR=1.01, 95% CI: 0.97-1.06, P=0.566). However, after 4 weeks of treatment, compared with the progesterone group, the level of sex hormones was significantly upregulated, while the
preterm birth rate (9.65% vs. 14.04%), the postpartum hemorrhage rate (3.10% vs. 5.62%), and the incidence of
adverse effects (17.44% vs. 32.58%) were considerably reduced in the dydrogesterone group (all P<0.05). XGBoost
algorithm analysis demonstrated that dydrogesterone treatment was correlated with a lower incidence of preterm
birth rate, postpartum hemorrhage, and adverse effects, ranking the 3rd, 2nd and 1st, respectively, in the weight of
dependent variables. Conclusion: Compared with progesterone, dydrogesterone can improve the delivery outcome
and demonstrate a higher safety in the treatment of threatened miscarriage due to corpus luteum insufficiency.

Introduction
Threatened miscarriage is a common disease
during early pregnancy, with a morbidity of 30%
to 40%, which could develop into a complete
miscarriage or dystocia without timely treatment [1]. Many pathogenic factors contribute
to the threatened miscarriage, of which lacking
progestogens due to the endocrine dysfunction
of corpus luteum is one of the main culprits [2,
3]. Therefore, supplementation of progestogens is a primary therapeutic strategy for the
treatment of threatened miscarriage due to
corpus luteum insufficiency, among which pro-

gesterone and dydrogesterone are the leading
medications in clinical practice [3-6]. Progesterone is an endogenous progestogen sex
hormone secreted by the corpus luteum.
Supplementation of progesterone is a direct
way to elevate progesterone levels caused by
insufficient corpus luteum secretion, which is
involved in the treatment of threatened miscarriage [7]. Dydrogesterone is an analog of the
progestogen, which is highly similar to endogenous progesterone in terms of the structure,
function, and biological characteristics [5]. In
recent years, dydrogesterone has been widely
used in the treatment of threatened miscar-

riage and assisted reproductive technology,
showing promising outcomes [8].
However, currently, golden standard for the
pharmaceutical dosage and the treatment
course of dydrogesterone is not available in
clinical practice. On the other hand, an accurate methodology for the judgment of luteal
function is absent. So far, there is still a lack
of high-quality and evidence-based research
regarding the clinical efficacy and safety of
dydrogesterone treatment [5, 8]. In addition,
there are few studies reporting the safety of
dydrogesterone in the treatment of threatened miscarriage due to corpus luteum insufficiency [9, 10]. XGBoost algorithm is an extended variant of boosting, which can be used as
an effective prediction model for uneven data
sets and is able to process highly diversified
descriptors and complex feature spaces [11,
12]. In this study, we designed a prospective
cohort study to compare the effect of droprogesterone and progesterone in the treatment
of threatened miscarriage due to corpus luteum insufficiency, applied the machine learning
XGBoost algorithm to analyze the clinical data
of 1,285 patients, and established a model to
accurately evaluate the safety and efficacy of
dydrogesterone in the treatment of threatened
miscarriage.

ders. ③ Patients had a history of recurrent miscarriage. ④ Patients were allergic to the target
drug. ⑤ Patients and their family members
were not willing to prevent the miscarriage. ⑥
Patients had poor treatment compliance or
incomplete clinical data.
Ethics statement
This study complied with the Declaration of
Helsinki and was approved by the Ethics
Committee of the Sixth People’s Hospital of
Zhuji. All patients were informed and signed the
consent form.
Treatment methods
Dydrogesterone group was treated with
Dydrogesterone tablets (Abbott Healthcare,
Netherlands). The first oral dose was 40 mg,
and the subsequent oral dose was 10 mg/time,
3 times/day, 2 weeks as a course of treatment.
Except for patients whose pregnancy was terminated, the rest patients were treated till 12
weeks of gestation.

Materials and methods

Progesterone group was treated with progesterone soft capsules (Zhejiang Pharmaceutical
Co., Ltd., China) orally, 0.1 g/time, 2 times/day,
2 weeks as a course of treatment. Except for
patients whose pregnancy was terminated, the
rest were treated till 12 weeks of gestation.

Patients

Measurements of sex hormone levels

A total of 1,285 patients treated in the outpatient of the Sixth People’s Hospital of Zhuji
from January 2013 to December 2017 with
threatened miscarriage due to corpus luteum
insufficiency were recruited in this study.
Among them, 665 received dydrogesterone
treatment (dydrogesterone group), and 620
received progesterone treatment (progesterone group). Inclusion criteria: ① Patients showed symptoms of early pregnancy, which was
confirmed by B-ultrasound, urine hCG test, and
history of menopause. ② The gestational week
was between the 6th to 10th week. ③ Patients
were diagnosed with threatened miscarriage
due to corpus luteum insufficiency [13]. ④
Patients were administered dydrogesterone or
progesterone soft capsules. Exclusion criteria:
① Patients were diagnosed with ectopic pregnancy. ② Patients were combined with severe
heart, liver, lung, kidney, and other organ disor-

Before treatment and 4 weeks after treatment,
4 mL of fasting peripheral venous blood was
collected from the patients in two groups in
the early morning, followed by centrifugation
for 15 min (3,000 r/min) to isolate the supernatant for testing. Electrochemiluminescence
(ECL) method was applied to quantify the levels
of estradiol (E2), human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG), and progesterone (P). E2, HCG, and
P kits were purchased from Wuhan Mingde
Biotechnology Co., Ltd., China.

Follow-up
All patients were followed up till the end of gestation. The adverse effects during the treatment were recorded, and patients’ gestation
and delivery outcome, including the gestational
week of delivery, delivery method, and complications during delivery were also recorded.

Dydrogesterone and progesterone in threatened miscarriage
Evaluation criteria
① Successful miscarriage prevention: gestation ≥28 weeks was considered as successful,
and less than 28 weeks or no gestational week
information was regarded as unsuccessful. ②
Preterm birth: gestation ≥28 weeks, but less
than 37 weeks was considered as preterm
birth [14].
XGBoost algorithm analysis
Establishment of XGBoost algorithm analysis
database: ① Data collection: the clinical data
of 1,285 patients with threatened miscarriage
due to corpus luteum insufficiency were collected, including the patients’ general information, testing data, and medication data. ②
Establishment of the database: the above data
were filtered and preprocessed to create an
XGBoost analysis database.
Variable system set-up: Target variables and
condition variables were set up. Target variables include the success rate of miscarriage
prevention, preterm birth, postpartum hemorrhage, and the incidence of adverse effects.
Condition variables include indicators such as
general information of the patients, pregnancy
information, medication regimen, combined
medication, and testing information.
XGBoost algorithm was adopted to establish
an evaluation model for the safety and efficacy
of dydrogesterone in the treatment of threatened miscarriage: ① The above two types of
data were imported, respectively. ② All discontinuous variables were processed to reduce
the dimensionality via principal component
analysis (PCA) and other methods to preliminarily filter important variables. ③ Different
parameter combinations were iterated and
tested using grid search method to refine the
important factors for endpoints. ④ Finally, the
data were extracted, constructed via decision
tree, and processed by correlation analysis to
establish an evaluation model for the safety
and efficacy of dydrogesterone in the treatment
of miscarriage.
Outcome measurements
The primary outcome measurements included
the success rate of miscarriage prevention,
delivery outcome, incidence of adverse effects,
and the results of XGBoost analysis in the two

4546

groups. The secondary outcome measurements included the time for clinical symptom
relief in the two groups and serum sex hormone
levels before and after treatment.
Statistical analysis
SPSS 23.0 (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) software was applied for the statistical analysis.
The count data were presented as the number
(n, %) and analyzed by χ2 test. The quantitative
data with normal distribution were
_ presented
as mean ± standard deviation ( x ± sd). The
comparison between the two groups was conducted by independent sample t-test, while the
comparison before and after treatment within
the same group was carried out by paired t-test.
The significance level was defined by two-sided
α=0.05. P<0.05 indicated the statistically significant difference.
Results
General information of the two groups of patients
A total of 1,285 patients with threatened miscarriage due to corpus luteum insufficiency
were recruited in this study, of which 665
patients received dydrogesterone treatment as
dydrogesterone group, and the other 620
patients were given progesterone soft capsules as progesterone group. There was no significant difference in terms of age, gestational
week, parity, pregnant times, number of single
births, proportion of habitual abortion history,
and number of cases of hypertension during
pregnancy between the two groups of patients
(P>0.05, Table 1).
Efficacy
The clinical symptoms of the two groups of
patients were significantly improved after
receiving dydrogesterone or progesterone
treatment for about 4 days. There was no significant difference in terms of time for lowback pain relief, time for abdominal pain relief,
and hemostasis time between the two groups
(P>0.05, Table 2). After 4 weeks of treatment,
the levels of serum sex hormones were significantly increased in the two groups as compared with those before treatment (P<0.001).
Of note, the levels of HCG, E2, and P were significantly higher in the dydrogesterone group

The success rate of miscarriage prevention and delivery
outcome in the two groups of
patients

Among the 665 patients in
the dydrogesterone group,
miscarriage was successfully
prevented in 580 cases while
85 cases failed, with a success rate of 87.22%. Among
the 620 patients in the progesterone group, miscarriage
was successfully prevented in
534 cases while 86 cases
failed, with a success rate of
86.13%. There was no significant difference regarding the
rate of miscarriage prevention
between the two groups of

Safety evaluation
The major adverse effects during treatment
included nausea, headache, breast tenderness, and breast induration. Compared with
the progesterone group, the total incidence of
adverse effects was significantly reduced in the
dydrogesterone group (P<0.001, Table 4).
Establishment of variables via XGBoost analysis
XGBoost data pool was constructed by using
the clinical data of 1,285 patients. A total of
1,114 cases successfully achieved miscarriage prevention and 171 cases failed. There
were 1,154 cases of normal delivery and 131
cases of preterm birth. There were 48 cases
of postpartum hemorrhage and 318 cases of
adverse effects, with a total incidence of
24.75%. A total of 665 cases were treated
with dydrogesterone and 620 cases were treated with progesterone. The combined medication included 15 kinds of Chinese medicines
such as multivitamins, Baotai Wuyou Tablet,
nifedipine, etc. A total of 10 parameters including white blood cell count, red blood cell count,
lymphocyte population and hematocrit were
included in the test, in which only the data of
early pregnancy were included. The size of final
data unit was 1,285×40 (Table 5).

Discussion
When the corpus luteum function is insufficient, the secretion of maternal progesterone
and other progestogens are not enough, which
cannot effectively inhibit the frequent contractions of the uterus and the immune rejection of
embryonic antigens, leading to the threatened
miscarriage [13, 15]. Therefore, normal corpus
luteum function plays important roles in the
successful implantation of the zygote, maintenance of gestation, and normal embryonic
development. Thus, the most direct and effective treatment strategy is the supplementation
of progestogens [16].
In this study, we designed a prospective cohort
study to evaluate the efficacy of dydrogesterone and progesterone in the treatment of
threatened miscarriage due to corpus luteum
insufficiency. The results demonstrated that
there is no significant difference regarding the
time for symptom relief and miscarriage prevention between the dydrogesterone group and
the progesterone group, which may be due to

Dydrogesterone and progesterone in threatened miscarriage
the fact that both treatment approaches could
stimulate estrogen secretion and inhibit uterine
smooth muscle contraction. However, progesterone has a slower onset of action but a rapid
inactivation by the liver after uptake by the
body, resulting in a very short half-life and poor
efficacy in some patients [17]. Studies have
also reported that long-term use of progesterone may cause adverse effects such as muscle twitches and gastrointestinal discomfort,
leading to limited clinical applications [18]. In
our study, serum sex hormone levels were elevated and the preterm birth rate was significantly reduced in patients treated with dydrogesterone. Manuck has also reported that
dydrogesterone could effectively reduce the
preterm birth rate [19]. Hudic et al. have
revealed that dydrogesterone treatment could
effectively upregulate the levels of the blocking
factor and interleukin (IL)-10 in pregnant
women with a high risk of preterm birth, and
regulate the ratio of Th1/Th2 to extend the
gestational period [20]. In addition, the rate of
postpartum hemorrhage and adverse effects
were significantly reduced in the dydrogesterone group of this study. Other studies have
also demonstrated that dydrogesterone could
effectively reduce the incidence of hypertension and preeclampsia during pregnancy,
which may be one of the mechanisms by which
dydrogesterone could reduce the incidence of
preterm birth and postpartum hemorrhage [21,
22]. Compared with progesterone soft capsules, the advantages of dydrogesterone in
the treatment of patients with threatened miscarriage due to corpus luteum insufficiency
include: ① As a progesterone analog, dydrogesterone can be quickly absorbed via oral
administration, and has a higher affinity and
specificity for progesterone receptors; ② It
can be orally administered, with few adverse
effects and higher medication compliance; ③ It
demonstrates a good immunomodulatory
effect, effectively reduces maternal immune
response to embryos, and promotes embryo
implantation; ④ It can inhibit the synthesis and
release of prostaglandins in the endometrium
and provide a favorable environment for embryo
development [23-25].
We further adopted the machine learning
XGBoost algorithm to evaluate the efficacy and
safety of dydrogesterone. Through the analysis
of the correlation between the patients’ clinical
data and endpoints after treatment, the impor-

4551

tant factors related to these endpoints were
discovered, and the evaluation model for the
safety and efficacy of dydrogesterone in the
treatment of threatened miscarriage was
established, which greatly improved the reliability of our data. The results revealed that dydrogesterone treatment was correlated with a
lower incidence of preterm birth, postpartum
hemorrhage, and adverse effects, ranking 3rd,
2nd, and 1st, respectively, in the weight of
dependent variables.
In summary, compared with progesterone,
dydrogesterone can significantly improve the
delivery outcome, showing a higher safety in
the treatment of threatened miscarriage due to
corpus luteum insufficiency.
