Abstract and Objective
The problem of Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs) detection is a
key issue in the pharmacovigilance community. Although many
related researches have been proposed in recent years, majority of them were concerned about the accuracy of the detected
adverse drug reactions, very few paying attention to the performance issue of how to quickly accomplish the detection process. In this work, we propose the concept of multivalueddimension contingency cube (MDC-cube) to facilitate multidimensional, fast and online detection of ADRs, especially those
caused by drug interactions. Experiments conducted on the
FDA AERS data set show that our MDC-cube based method is
an order of magnitude faster than the state-of-the-art ABCMMS method.

Introduction
Adverse Drug Reaction (ADR) refers to uncomfortable and/or
harmful side effects yielded by normal doses of drug usage.
Since many ADRs are only seen in long term, post-

marketing surveillance of drug usage, spontaneous reporting systems (SRSs) have been established to collect
suspected adverse drug events for further analysis, e.g.,
the USA FDA Adverse Event Reporting System
(FAERS).
The constant and fast increasing in the amount of reports accumulated by SRSs has precluded the possibility for human analysis to detect ADR signals, motivating the development of
many statistical- or data-mining-based algorithms for ADR detection. Unfortunately, contemporary methods for ADR detection were developed aiming at improving the signal quality,
very few paying attention to the performance aspect. This not
only lengthens the process of ADR detection, but also hinders
the analysts from performing interactive, stratified analysis, i.e.,
inspecting from many different aspects and demographic conditions, such as gender, age, etc.

Methods
Inspired by the success of data cube technique to facilitate OLAP analysis widely used in business intelligence, we
propose a new type of data cube, namely multivalueddimension contingency cube (MDC-cube), which embodies the
concept of multivalued dimension, i.e., the member of a dimen-

sion can be a set of items (multivalues) and stores in each cube
cell a contingency table essential for measuring the disproportionality (e.g., PRR, ROR) of an ADR signal. The following figure illustrates a MDC-cube composed of three dimensions, Gender, Symptom, and Drug, where the cube cell [M,
{d2, d3}, s1] stores the corresponding contingency table used
for computing the measurement of the ADR signal: Gender =
Male, Drug = {d2, d3} o Symptom = s1, e.g., PRR = a (c + d)
/ [c (a + b)]. In this way, the computation of each signal can be
generated on the fly. Note that the number of dimensions (variables) involved in a MDC-cube can be more than three, yet all
dimensions other than Drug and Symptom are optional.

Results
We have compared our MDC-cube based method with an associative classification based approach, ABCM-MS, which employs a tree structure similar to the FP-tree structure used by
the leading FP-Growth algorithm for associations mining. We
tested both methods over the 2007 FAERS dataset, which contains 140183 reports, composed of 9644 drugs and 7689 symptoms. The evaluation was inspected from two aspects, the number of predicates, indicating the query complexity, and the data
size. Specifically, we consider two extremes of query complexity, one with only one predicate (demographic) attribute and the
other with all predicate attributes. The results show that our
MDC method is an order of magnitude faster than ABCM-MS,
with speedup ranging from 10 ~ 30.

Conclusion
In this paper, we have presented our proposed new type of data
cube, MDC-cube, which can facilitate an OLAP-like on-line
detection of ADR signals from huge volume of SRS dataset.
This method has been implemented to enhance the performance
of our developed iADRs system, a web-based interactive system for ADR detection. We currently are pursuing ways to extend this cube model to cope with the uncertainty issue, e.g.,
missing values.
