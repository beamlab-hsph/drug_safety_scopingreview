Abstract
The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS, formerly
AERS) is a database that contains information on adverse event and medication error reports
submitted to the FDA. Besides those from manufacturers, reports can be submitted from health
care professionals and the public. The original system was started in 1969, but since the last major
revision in 1997, reporting has markedly increased. Data mining algorithms have been developed
for the quantitative detection of signals from such a large database, where a signal means a statistical association between a drug and an adverse event or a drug-associated adverse event, including the proportional reporting ratio (PRR), the reporting odds ratio (ROR), the information
component (IC), and the empirical Bayes geometric mean (EBGM). A survey of our previous
reports suggested that the ROR provided the highest number of signals, and the EBGM the lowest.
Additionally, an analysis of warfarin-, aspirin- and clopidogrel-associated adverse events suggested
that all EBGM-based signals were included in the PRR-based signals, and also in the IC- or
ROR-based ones, and that the PRR- and IC-based signals were in the ROR-based ones. In this
article, the latest information on this area is summarized for future pharmacoepidemiological
studies and/or pharmacovigilance analyses.

Introduction
The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS, formerly
AERS) is a database that contains information on adverse event and medication error reports submitted to
the FDA [1-3]. The database is designed to support the
FDA's post-marketing safety surveillance program for
drug and therapeutic biologic products [1-3]. Its
structure adheres to the international safety reporting

guidance issued by the International Conference on
Harmonisation, ICH E2B [1-3]. Adverse events and
medication errors are coded using terms in the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA)
terminology [4]. The reports from manufacturers are
either expedited, which must be submitted within 15
days, or periodic [1-3]. Reports can also be submitted
by health care professionals and the public through
http://www.medsci.org

Int. J. Med. Sci. 2013, Vol. 10
the “MedWatch” program [1-3]. The original system
was started in 1969, but since the last major revision in
1997, reporting has markedly increased [5, 6]. To date,
the FAERS is the largest repository of spontaneously
reported adverse events in the world with more than
4 million reports [5, 6]. The FDA releases the data to
the public, and public access offers the possibility to
external researchers and/or pharmacovigilance experts to explore this data source, that is, allows conducting pharmacoepidemiological studies and/or
pharmacovigilance analyses.
Pharmacoepidemiology is defined as the study
of the use and effects of drugs in large numbers of
people, whereas pharmacovigilance is the science and
activities relating to the detection, assessment, understanding and prevention of adverse effects or any
other drug-related problems [7-9]. The FAERS database is useful for analyzing associations with adverse
events, but if used for pharmacovigilance, where early
and timely detection is important [10-13], has two
major deficiencies [14-16]: the lag time from collection
to public release of the data, and the form in which the
data are released, i.e., ASCII or SMGL files, which is
not readily amenable to query or analysis [14-16].
Additionally, spontaneous reports can have missing
data, and more than 2 reports can be submitted for
one patient (duplicated reports) [17]. Through an attempt to address these shortcomings, a novel system,
named the CzeekV system, has been developed by Dr.
Okuno in collaboration with Kyoto Constella Technologies Co., Ltd., Japan, and we have employed to
evaluate the safety profiles of several drugs [18-26].
Data mining algorithms are applied for the quantitative detection of signals [17, 27-30], where a signal
means a statistical association between a drug and an
adverse event or a drug-associated adverse event,
including the proportional reporting ratio (PRR) [31],
the reporting odds ratio (ROR) [32], the information
component (IC) given by a Bayesian confidence
propagation neural network [33], and the empirical
Bayes geometric mean (EBGM) [34]. In this article, the
4 methods will be compared in terms of the signal
contents, and the latest information on this area is
summarized for future investigations.

FAERS database
A data set consists of 7 data tables; patient demographic and administrative information (DEMO),
drug/biologic information (DRUG), adverse events
(REAC), patient outcomes (OUTC), report sources
(RPSR), drug therapy start and end dates (THER), and
indications for use/diagnosis (INDI). The drugs in the
DRUG table are assigned as any of primary suspect,
secondary suspect, concomitant, or interacting. The

797
adverse events in the REAC table are coded using the
preferred terms (PTs) in the MedDRA. It should be
noted that there are a number of duplicated entries
and the data occasionally contain misspelling and
miswords. In our previous reports [18-26], input data
were taken from the public release of the FAERS database from the first quarter of 2004 through the end
of 2009, and the total number of reports used was
2,231,029. Prior to data mining, duplicated reports
were deleted according to the FDA's recommendation
of adopting the most recent CASE number, resulting
in a reduction in the number of reports from 2,231,029
to 1,644,220. Several adverse events coded by PT
terms and several drugs can be listed in a report. All
drug names were unified into generic names by a
text-mining approach, because FAERS permits the
registering of arbitrary drug names, including trade
names and abbreviations. Spelling errors were detected by a spell checker software, GNU Aspell, and
carefully confirmed by working pharmacists. The
total number of errors was 223,239. Foods, beverages,
treatments (e.g. X-ray radiation), and unspecified
names (e.g. beta-blockers) were omitted for this study,
and the total number of omissions was 164,384. Consequently, a total of 22,017,956 co-occurrences were
found in 1,644,220 reports, where a co-occurrence was
a pair of a drug and an adverse event, and they were
the basis for the signal detection. Of the 1,644,220 reports used for data mining, gender data were available for 1,520,994 (92.5%); 605,271 (36.8%) for males
and 915,723 (55.7%) for females. Age data were
available for 1,084,999 reports (66.0%), and the average (±SD) was 52.7±23.2 years.

Data mining algorithms
Data mining algorithms have been developed to
identify drug-associated adverse events (signals) that
are reported more frequently than expected by estimating expected reporting frequencies on the basis of
information on all drugs and all events in the database
[17, 27-30]. For example, PRR [31], ROR [32], IC [33],
and EBGM [34] are widely used, and indeed, currently employed by the Medicines and Healthcare
products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), UK, the
Netherlands Pharmacovigilance Centre, the World
Health Organization (WHO), and the FDA, respectively. All of these algorithms calculate signal scores,
i.e., the values for PRR, ROR, IC, and EBGM, to assess
whether a drug is significantly associated with an
adverse event or not. These calculations or algorithms, so-called the disproportionality analyses or
measures, however, differ from one another in that
the PRR and ROR are frequentist (non-Bayesian),
whereas the IC and EBGM are Bayesian.

A two-by-two contingency table is the framework for analysis (Table 1). The number of
co-occurrences of interest is defined as n11. The
number of co-occurrences with a drug of interest, but
without an adverse of interest, is defined as n10, and
the number n01 is assigned to those without a drug of
interest, but with an adverse event of interest. The
number of co-occurrences without either is as n00,
and using them, the PRR and ROR are defined as:

798
[28]. It is important to understand both the strengths
and weaknesses of data mining algorithms to minimize their misapplication and misuse [27]. We recommend that readers refer to the many excellent review articles on data mining algorithms published
previously [17, 27-30].

The observed-to-expected ratio, n11/n11 (expected), is used for calculation of the IC and EBGM.
The IC is a logarithmic metric of n11/n11 (expected)
that is implemented in a Bayesian framework, and
n11/n11 (expected) is known as the EBGM, when
implemented within an empirical Bayesian framework.
In this section, only the scoring thresholds are
given. The reader is referred to the articles for more
extensive details on each statistical test [31-34]. Using
the PRR, a signal is detected if the number of
co-occurrences is 3 or more and the PRR is 2 or more
with an associated χ2 value of 4 or more [31]. For the
ROR, a signal is detected, if the lower limit of the 95%
two-sided confidence interval exceeds 1 [32]. Signal
detection using the IC is done using the IC025 metric,
a lower limit of the 95% two-sided confidence interval
of the IC, and a signal is detected if the IC025 value
exceeds 0 [33]. Finally, for the EBGM, the EB05 metric,
a lower one-sided 95% confidence limit of the EBGM,
is used and a signal is detected when the EB05 is
greater than or equal to the threshold value 2.0 [34]. In
our studies [18-26], these 4 methods were used to detect signals, and the adverse events were listed as
drug-associated, when at least 1 of 4 indices met the
criteria indicated above.
In 2003, the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America-FDA Collaborative Working
Group on Safety Evaluation Tools, consisting of statisticians, pharmacoepidemiologists, and pharmacovigilance professionals from the pharmaceutical
industry and the FDA, reviewed the best practices for
the use of these methods [28]. In summary, they stated
that there is evidence that data mining may be useful,
but the evidence is not sufficient to fully judge the
value of data mining in pharmacovigilance, and that
time and experience will reveal the value and utility

n11: the number of co-occurrences of interest. n11+n10: the total number of
co-occurrences with a drug of interest. n11+n01: the total number of
co-occurrences with an adverse event of interest. n11+n10+n01+n00: the total
number of co-occurrences in the database.

Comparison of 4 data mining algorithms
In Table 2, an example of output data is provided
to both familiarize readers with the analysis and show
the differences between the 4 signal scores. These data
are
on
the
warfarin-,
aspirinand
clopidogrel-associated haematemesis, and those on
haemorrhage, haematoma, melaena and haematochezia have already published previously [26]. The
total number of warfarin-associated adverse events
was 736, and 848 for aspirin and 838 for clopidogrel
[26]. According to the number of co-occurrences,
haematemesis ranked 56th among 736 warfarin-associated adverse events, 13th among 848 aspiamong
838
rin-associated
ones,
and
61st
clopidogrel-associated ones. The number of
co-occurrences is an important index for monitoring
the emergence of an adverse event, but is independent
of the signal scores and/or performance of detection
of signals. For example, haematemesis ranked 559th,
375th, and 581st, respectively, according to the ROR
score. Moreover, it should be noted that whether an
adverse event is detected as a signal or not depends
on the algorithm used for signal detection. Indeed, as
shown in Table 2, based on the ROR and IC, the
analysis indicated the association of these 3 drugs
with haematemesis; however, it was not associated
with warfarin when the PRR was used, and the EBGM
failed to detect the associations for warfarin and
clopidogrel.

data are on the associations with haematemesis, and those on haemorrhage, haematoma, melaena and haematochezia have already published previously [26].

The relationships between the 4 algorithms and
numbers of signals are summarized in Table 3. This
table was constructed using the data in our previous
reports [19, 20, 22-26]. Among the 4 methods, the ROR
provided the highest number of signals, and the
EBGM the lowest. The difference in the number of
signals can be explained by a higher rate of false positives or a lower ability to detect the signals. Without
standards, one cannot know which the case is. Additionally, an analysis was done here using the data on
warfarin, aspirin and clopidogrel, and it was indicated that all EBGM-based signals were included in the
PRR-based signals, and also in the IC- or ROR-based
ones, and that the PRR- and IC-based signals were in
the ROR-based ones. In other words, the ROR-based
signals could be stratified into 5 groups; the signals
detected by the ROR only, the signals detected by the
ROR and PRR, the signals detected by the ROR and
IC, the signals detected by the ROR, PRR, and IC, and
the signals detected by the 4 methods. If this relationship will be confirmed for other drugs, it can be
concluded that the EBGM is the most conservative
algorithm.
Several studies have compared data mining algorithms [32, 35-40]; however, as Bate and Evans recently concluded [17], the different algorithms have
slightly different properties and consequently one
might be preferable in a particular application. If used
for pharmacovigilance, the data mining algorithms
should be assessed from the standpoint of early and
timely signal detection [10-13]. There are limited published comparative data, but recently, Chen et al.
compared the timing of early signal detection with the
PRR, ROR, IC and EBGM using the FAERS database,
and concluded that the ROR showed the better performance [10]. This does not conflict our finding
mentioned above.
Several strategies have been proposed to increase the power to detect signals, and consequently
to heighten pharmacovigilance, including integration
with other databases [41] and removing already
known drug-event associations [42]. Detecting signals
not described in the prescribing information for a
drug at the time of its approval, but supported by

published evidence for an association (unlabeled
supported signals), is important, and a high rate of
detection of unlabeled supported signals is attained
by data mining using higher level terms than the PT,
i.e., the HLT or the Standard MedDRA Queries
(SMQ), a group of PT terms [43]. New statistical
methodologies will be continuously developed [44,
45], and therefore we will not be able to draw a conclusion concerning which is best for some time. Prior
to discussion, it is important to elucidate the difference in the table of adverse events listed as
drug-associated.

Advantages of FAERS data mining
It is well-accepted that a randomized, prospective, large-scale and long-term clinical trial is the best
way to assess the association between a drug and an
adverse event; however, such trials are not practical
http://www.medsci.org

Int. J. Med. Sci. 2013, Vol. 10
due to great expenses of time and cost, especially for
rare but clinically important adverse events [46, 47].
Data mining of the FAERS database might provide
previously unknown, but clinically important associations, and give us useful suggestions to guide clinical
decision making. Additionally, the FAERS database
might be a useful tool for pharmaceutical companies’
post-marketing activities [48], and given an association between pre-marketing data and post-marketing
signal [49], the database might provide constructive
suggestions about the method of pre-marketing data
collection.
Our studies suggested that FAERS data mining
reproduced some well-established clinical associations, including cisplatin and nephrotoxicity [19],
carboplatin and myelosuppression [19], oxaliplatin
and peripheral sensory neuropathy [19], capecitabine
and hand-foot syndrome [22], statins and muscular
events [23], proton pump inhibitors and hypomagnesaemia [25], and antiplatelets and bleeding complications [26]. These results indicate the usefulness of
the database and algorithms used, but do not certify
an ability to provide previously unknown, but clinically important associations.
In 2003, an editorial comment concerning the efficacy and safety of a drug, published in a respected
scientific journal, had a considerable impact, since it
claimed that no reliable data were provided by a
manufacturer [50]. Debate about this issue continued
in the journal until Meyboom and Edwards concluded
that there was a need to improve and accelerate
pharmacovigilance [51]. The FAERS database relies
on reports not only from manufacturers but also from
health care professionals and the public, and one advantage is that the database includes end-user assessments.
The coding of adverse events and medication
errors using the PT terms in the MedDRA has considerable advantages. For example, the terminology
used to describe statin-associated muscular symptoms varies and therefore the incidence varies among
reports [52, 53]. The National Lipids Association’s
Muscle Expert Panel and other statin experts have
emphasized the importance of standardizing related
terms to allow reliable comparisons among studies
and to improve care for statin users [53]. This does not
apply only to statins, and the employment of
MedDRA ensures higher quality results.
In 2009, a pilot study performed by Hochberg et
al. concerning drug-versus-drug comparisons found
the rank-order of adverse event rates in the FAERS
database to be consistent with the results of published
studies, encouraging the use of the database for
comparisons [54]. The number of reports with or

800
without normalization by usage or sales during the
corresponding period was used to compare drugs
[55], but adverse events are underreported (discussed
later), which might lead to incorrect conclusions [46,
47, 56, 57]. To date, we have no evidence that the signal scores can be used to determine the rank-order of
drugs in terms of risk. Indeed, they were calculated
for several drugs in the same class, but a discussion
about the difference in susceptibility to adverse events
was pending [58-61].

Limitations of FAERS data mining
In general, adverse events are underreported in
spontaneous reporting systems [62-66]. The rate of
reporting can vary with the particular adverse event
[1], but averages just 6% [62]. Various factors can be
determinants of underreporting, but the knowledge
and attitude of health professionals seem to be most
important [63]. Indeed, educational intervention was
shown to improve the rate of reporting [64, 65]. A
patient-targeted survey found that 87% of patients
spoke to their physicians about a possible connection,
but the physicians were more likely to exclude than
affirm the possibility [66]. Pharmacists, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants play an important
role [67, 68], and more publicity for the FAERS database and/or education should be considered to promote patient reporting [69]. Even though the reporting rate has dramatically improved, the FAERS database is still not appropriate for estimating incidence
rates, due to the absence of a denominator [1].
The number of reports and signals, and the signal scores are influenced by various factors. The
number of reports increases over the first 2 years after
launching, and then starts going down [5, 6]. This is
known as the Weber effect [70], although it is not always observed [71]. The number of signals and signal
scores also possibly fluctuate during several years
after launching, and the number of unlabeled supported signals depends on the time window after
launching [72]. Generally speaking, reporting can be
accelerated after a drug-associated adverse event is
highlighted [73-75], and this is known as the notoriety
effect [74]. Additionally, the notoriety for a drug can
accelerate the reporting of other drugs in the same
class, known as the ripple effect [74]. In contrast, signal scores can be suppressed by a large number of
reports in which the same adverse event is connected
with other drugs [76]. This is the masking or cloaking
effect [76]. Close attention should be paid to the results of signal detection, especially for drugs launched
only recently, and it is important to investigate a
temporal axis, when planning a pharmacovigilance
analysis [73].
http://www.medsci.org

Int. J. Med. Sci. 2013, Vol. 10
It should be noted that there is no credible
counterfactual means, e.g., a randomized control
group, to list signals, and therefore disease-oriented
adverse events can be listed also. For example, 238
colistin-associated adverse events included sepsis,
pseudomonas infection, Acinetobacter infection, and
influenza-like illness [20]. Generally, the results can be
biased by unmeasured confounding factors; e.g., the
association of a drug with an adverse event might be
explained by those of other drugs which are often
co-administered. Although a comparison of drugs in
the same class can offset confounding factors, enabling drug-versus-drug comparisons, a statistically
well-organized methodology should be established to
minimize their effects.
The data mining algorithms are designed to
identify bivariate associations, and the possibility that
an adverse event occurred synergistically with more
than 2 drugs is excluded. Harpaz et al. have recently
analyzed the possibility of multi-item adverse event
associations, i.e., associations relating multiple drugs
to possibly multiple adverse events [77]. Multi-item
associations are rarely reported but are important
because they can indicate drug-drug interactions, and
a total of 1,167 multi-item associations were identified
using 162,744 reports [77]. Signal scores after stratification by the presence or absence of co-administration
might provide information about the drug-drug interaction.

Closing remarks
The FAERS database has been used to analyze
the safety profiles of various drugs. Additionally, the
highly suspicious drugs to induce some serious adverse events are listed by analyzing the FAERS database, including torsades de pointes [78, 79] and Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis
[80]. Several organizations maintain their own
well-organized databases of spontaneously reported
adverse events, and use them to analyze associations
with drugs. The WHO Programme for International
Drug Monitoring, starting in 1968, is a cornerstone of
world-wide pharmacovigilance, and the Uppsala
Monitoring Centre, Uppsala, Sweden, maintains the
WHO Global Individual Case Safety Report Database,
VigiBase [81-84]. In France, pharmacovigilance activities are carried out by 31 regional centers based in
clinical pharmacology departments of university
hospitals [85, 86], and the French Pharmacovigilance
Database has been used to analyze the safety profiles
of various drugs [87-91]. Additionally, two European
databases, that is, the General Practitioners Research
Database (GPRD) in the UK, and the PHARMO Record Linkage System in the Netherlands, are also fre-

801
quently used for analytical studies [92]. In the near
future, a device or infrastructure enabling real-time
analysis at a doctor’s office or by a patient will be
provided by information technology service companies.
Data mining does not provide sufficient evidence on causality, and merely suggests the necessity
for well-organized clinical studies with respect to associations. The WHO defines a “signal” as “reported
information on a possible causal relationship between
an adverse event and a drug, the relationship being
unknown or incompletely documented previously”
[7, 8]; however, considerable ambiguity remains in the
definition in reports [93-95]. Poluzzi et al. used the
FAERS database to list drugs liable to induce torsades
de pointes, and thereafter authorized reports were
used as references to stratify the signals into expected
and unexpected signals [78, 79]. Torsades de pointes is
considered a designated medical event, i.e., a
low-probability event with drug-attributed risk, and a
case-by-case analysis is of primary importance [40].
As for unexpected signals, they emphasized the necessity for further investigation and close surveillance
[78, 79].
A debate recently published in a respected
journal indicates both the advantages and limitations
of data mining of spontaneously reported adverse
event databases [96, 97]. de Boer emphasized that the
disproportionality measures as used in spontaneous
reporting databases have important limitations and
more advanced way might generate new relevant
knowledge worth publishing [96]. In contrast, Montastruc et al. commented that none of the methods
(e.g., case-control studies and cohort studies), if taking
alone, should be considered as definitive for evaluating drug risk, and disproportionality studies appear
to be important today, due to a growing demand for
safer drugs [97]. A report in the FAERS database is a
story, sometimes only a rumor, but numerous reports
can reflect reality. With larger numbers of faithful
reports, the FAERS database and other spontaneously
reported databases should help to optimize pharmacotherapy.
