ABSTRACT

ARTICLE HISTORY

Objectives: The objectives were to identify drugs related with anemia in children and evaluate the
novelty of these correlations.
Methods: The authors established a two-step method for detecting the relationship between drugs and
anemia using electronic medical records (EMRs), which were obtained from 247,136 patients in Beijing
Children’s Hospital between 2007 and 2017. The authors extracted potential drugs by mining cases for
hemoglobin abnormalities from the EMR and then performed a retrospective cohort study to correlate
them with anemia by calculating the matched odds ratios and 95% confidence interval using unconditional logistic regression analysis.
Results: In total, nine positive drug-anemia associations were identified. Among them, the correlations
of drugs fluconazole (OR 3.95; 95%CI: 2.65–5.87) and cefathiamidine (OR 3.49; 95%CI: 2.94–4.15) with
anemia were considered new signals in both children and adults. Three associations of drugs, vancomycin, cefoperazone-sulbactam and ibuprofen, with anemia were considered new signals in children.
Conclusion: The authors detected nine signals of drug-induced anemia, including two new signals in
children and adults and three new signals in children. This study could serve as a model for using EMR
and automatic mining to monitor adverse drug reaction signals in the pediatric population.

1. Introduction
The administration of drugs may lead to the development of
a wide variety of red blood cell disorders, including anemia [1].
Increasingly, studies have reported many drugs linked to anemia, such as trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole [2], cytosine arabinoside [3], tuberculosis drugs [4], and chloramphenicol [5],
among others. It has been shown that drug-induced anemia
may be caused by non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or
salicylates in up to 75% of patients [6]. While the frequency of
these adverse drug reactions (ADRs) varies depending on the
condition, they can be associated with a significantly increased
morbidity and mortality [7]. Children are a unique population
due to their immature renal and hepatic systems. Their fragile
physiology places them at particularly high risk for harm when
an ADR occurs [8]. Therefore, detecting the signs of druginduced anemia is of great significance in post-marketing
surveillance, especially in pediatric cases.
Traditionally, detection of ADR mainly depended on the spontaneous reporting system (SRS), which is a passive system relying
on health care providers and patients to inform about suspected
ADRs [9]. The SRS is a relatively cost-effective method for

monitoring drug safety because it has the advantage of encompassing a large number of patients. However, the SRS have several
limitations, such as the fact that the risk associated with a drug is
not quantified due to the lack of denominator information on
drug use. The numerator is also inaccurate, as it is subject to
under-reporting. Spontaneous reports may also be of poor quality
by missing important details that would enable causality assessment [10]. These shortcomings limit the role of the SRS in the
discovery of the ADR signals.
In recent years, electronic medical records (EMRs) have
emerged as an alternative source for detection of ADR signals
[11]. Compared with SRS, EMR databases contain detailed information about drug administration and clinical data of patients,
including their follow-ups. EMRs provide reliable real-world data
that has been used to discover possible ADR signals beyond
passive detection. A computerized search program can be developed to actively mine ADRs accurately and efficiently from the
structured and unstructured data contained in the EMRs [12,13].
It is also possible to adjust the confounders by setting appropriate controls, allowing to discover ADR signals more accurately.
Many studies have carried out the detection of ADR signals
using EMRs via different methods. Notably, Ramirez et al.

reported that various severe ADRs, such as agranulocytosis,
aplastic anemia, liver injury, thrombocytopenia, hyponatremia,
and rhabdomyolysis, were associated with drugs including
central nervous agents (analgesics, antidepressants, anticonvulsants and benzodi-azepines), systemic anti-infective agents
(antimicrobials), hormone-modifying agents (hypoglycemic
agents, estrogens and progesterone, glucocorticoids) using
automatic laboratory signals detection [14]; and Wang et al.
found 132 potential ADRs associated with seven drugs (ibuprofen, morphine, warfarin, bupropion, paroxetine, rosiglitazone, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors) using natural
language processing [15]. However, few studies have been
conducted to explore the ADRs signals in children.
In this study, we established a two-step method to conduct
a retrospective cohort study in order to identify potential druginduced anemia signals from EMR data, and we evaluated these
signals to provide candidate drugs for further intensive medicines monitoring and causality assessment studies.

2. Methods
2.1. Data source
The study was conducted at the Beijing Children’s Hospital (BCH),
a 970-bed tertiary teaching hospital affiliated to the Capital
Medical University in Beijing city. The Medical Ethics Committee
of BCH approved the protocol for this study. Hospital-level, retrospective data were obtained from the EMRs of BCH, which

contained 8,927,894 prescriptions and 49,685,862 laboratory data
from 3,791,60 hospitalizations of 247,136 patients. We studied
admission information, diagnoses, laboratory information, discharge summaries and medication lists from 1 January 2010 to
31 December 2017.

2.2. Study design
2.2.1. Laboratory signal detection
The anemia cases were selected based on a hemoglobin (Hb)
level < 110 g/L, following the World Health Organization criteria
that defines anemia by a Hb concentration below the mean for
a normal population of the same gender and age [1]. The normal
range for the Hb test obtained from the EMR database of BCH is
110–160 g/L. A Hb test value < 110 g/L was considered an ADR
signal. Laboratory tests within the normal range were considered
normal. The existence of a positive ADR signal would trigger
a query for the existence of available data for age, sex, admission
date and main diagnosis before and after the date of the abnormal laboratory value. If these data were available, then that
patient was included in the study.

2.2.2. Stage 1: selection of potential drugs that could
cause anemia
Figure 1 shows the design and workflow of stage 1. This step
aimed to mine potential drugs from the EMR database that
could cause anemia by ranking the patients who were

EXPERT OPINION ON DRUG SAFETY

exposed to the investigated drug and who had abnormal
laboratory test results during their hospitalization.

2.2.2.1. Population identification. The study only included
data from patients who met the following selection criteria: (1)
they underwent at least two Hb test results during the same
admission, with the initial Hb test result being normal; and (2)
they were aged ≥1 year at the time of admission [16]. In
addition, we excluded patients with a disease that directly
affected Hb concentration (shown in Supplemental Table 1).

995

ADR or not was compared with that of patients unexposed
to the drug that experienced or not the same ADR. Every
patient in the exposed group was matched to four patients
in the unexposed group according to propesity score using
the nearest neighbor matching principle. The score was calculated based on age, sex, admission date, and main diagnosis
(according to the categories listed in the 10th revision of the
International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related
Health Problems). Adjusted odds ratios (OR) was calculated for
each drug-anemia association using a unconditional logistic
regression.

2.2.2.2. Potential drug identification. The extracted drugs
were ranked in descending order according to the rate of
anemia occurrence. The potential drugs were selected for
further analysis according to the condition that the total
usage cases was greater than 1000, and the incidence of
anemia was greater than 20%.

2.2.3. Stage 2: detection of associations between drugs
and anemia
Figure 2 showed the design and workflow of stage 2. This step
aimed to correlate candidate drugs with anemia from the EMR
database by a retrospective cohort study. The number of
patients exposed to the specific drug and experiencing an

Figure 2. Design and work flow for the detection of anemia signals.

2.2.3.1. Population identification. Patients in the exposed
group were exposed to the study drug at least once and had
the Hb test results both before and after receiving the medication. All patients included in the exposed groups had
a normal Hb test result prior to the first use of the potential
drug. Patients in the unexposed group were not exposed to
the study drug and had undergone at least two Hb test results
with a normal initial Hb test result. All patients included in
both the exposed and unexposed groups met the criteria
mentioned in stage 1. In addition, cases in which the Hb
concentration was directly affected by a disease or by taking
other drugs from the admission to the occurrence of anemia

in both exposed group and unexposed group were excluded
(shown in Supplemental Table 1).

2.2.3.2. Signal detection. The adjusted OR and 95% CI for the
association between each drug and anemia were calculated using
unconditional logistic regression. The signal of a drug-anemia pair
was determined to be positive if the OR > 1.0. A P-value < 0.001
was considered to indicate statistical significance.

2.2.4. Signal novelty assessment
Not all statistically significant associations should be regarded
as potential new signals and further validation was needed to
evaluate these signals [17]. Since there is no recognized gold
standard for evaluating the relevance of the drug-anemia
relationship, we performed a manual review of the summary
of product characteristics (SPCs) included in Micromedex, DXY
Drugs Information, and electronic Medicines Compendium,
and we reviewed the literature using PubMed, China
National Knowledge Infrastructure and Wanfang Data. We
considered the association of drug and anemia as a new signal
if it had not been reported in the summary of product characteristics or in the literature.

2.2.5. Data analysis
MySQL software version 14.14 (Oracle, California, USA) was
used as a database management system to extract the
required data from BCH’s EMR database. Excel software 2016
(Microsoft, Washington, USA) was used for data processing
and R 3.5.1 software was used for statistical analysis.
The lower bound of the 95% CI of the adjusted OR was
used as the final association score. The association between
each drug and anemia was detected by calculating the OR and
95% CI using unconditional logistic regression analysis.
Propensity score (PS) was used to match the exposed and
unexposed groups by age, sex, admission date and main
diagnosis of discharge (based on disease code). An association
between a drug and anemia was determined to be a positive
signal if the OR > 1.0. All reported P-values from two-tailed
lower than 0.001 considered to indicate statistical significance.

3. Results
3.1. Detection of drug-induced anemia
We built a two-step method based on data mining of the EMR
database of BHC and regression analysis to study the association
between different drugs and anemia. The cases of anemia were
detected from laboratory values. A total of 1,161 drugs were
mined, and 687 drugs remained after merging the drugs with
different trade names. Among these, 13 suspected drugs were
selected according to the screening conditions for further analysis
of anemia signals. The main drug classes were antibacterials and
antipyretic analgesics, followed by antifungals, hypnotic sedatives,
antiallergics, and diuretics (see Table 1).
Table 2 lists the 13 specific drugs that may cause anemia.
Among these 13 drugs, our method identified nine that induced
anemia: fluconazole (OR 3.95; 95% CI: 2.65–5.87), vancomycin (OR
2.81; 95% CI: 2.07–3.80), sulfamethoxazole (OR 2.12; 95% CI:
1.44–3.11), cefoperazone-sulbactam (OR 2.46; 95% CI: 2.07–2.93),

lysine acetylsalicylate (OR 2.78; 95% CI: 2.45–3.14), paracetamol
(OR 1.75; 95% CI: 1.52–2.01), cefathiamidine (OR 3.49; 95% CI:
2.94–4.15), ceftriaxone (OR 1.46; 95% CI: 1.17–1.82) and ibuprofen
(OR 2.87; 95% CI: 2.67–3.07). The following four drugs were not
found to be associated with anemia: furosemide (P = 6.91 × 10−3),
phenobarbital (P = 6.27 × 10−2), chlorpheniramine
(P = 8.50 × 10−2) and cefaclor (P = 9.33 × 10−3). The remaining
9 drugs required further evaluation and verification.

3.2. Novelty evaluation of nine signals
After the signals were detected, we evaluated their novelty by
reviewing the drugs in the summary of product characteristics
and the literature. The available information is showed in
Table 3. Of these, two of the drug-anemia associations (fluconazole and cefathiamidine) were not previously described in
the literature, neither in adults nor in children. Three other
drugs (vancomycin, cefoperazone-sulbactam and ibuprofen)
had been previously associated with anemia in in adults but
not in children. The relationship between the remaining four
drugs (sulfamethoxazole, lysine acetylsalicylate, paracetamol,
ceftriaxone) and anemia was consistent with previous reports
found in the literature.

4. Discussion
Exploratory analysis of electronic EMRs can potentially identify
important safety signals. In this study, we applied a two-step
method to detect ADR signals of drug-induced anemia using
an EMR database. Our study found 13 drugs potentially associated with anemia, meriting further analysis based on the
contingency table, then nine positive signals of these druganemia associations were found. Of these, two associations
were considered new signals in children and adults, three
associations were new signals in children, and four had been
previously documented to be associated with anemia. We
found that drug-induced anemia occurred most frequently
during use of antibacterial agents (55%) and antipyretic and

c Yes = drug–anemia association was reported in Adults

analgesic agents (27%). These results were consistent with
previous findings [18].

4.1. Potential signals
The association of two drugs (fluconazole and cefathiamidine)
and anemia was identified as new signals. Fluconazole is an
antifungal agent with both fungicidal and fungistatic properties, which was identified as a potential drug that could cause
anemia. Although no reports indicated that fluconazole could
cause anemia, the antifungal drug, terbinafine, was reported
could cause aplastic anemia [19]. The mechanism of action of
this highly lipophilic agents relies on an energy-dependent
transmembrane efflux pump, P-glycoprotein (P-gp).
Abnormal P-gp in cells leads to cytoplasmic drug accumulation and an enhanced toxic effect of drugs [20]. A report
showed that P-gp function was reduced in patients with
aplastic anemia [21]. Therefore, we speculated that prolonged
use of fluconazole would cause hematotoxicity and lead to
aplastic anemia; however, further research is warranted.
Cefathiamidine was the first semi-synthetic cephalosporin
developed in China and belongs to the new generation of
cephalosporins. There is no literature on the association of

cefathiamidine with anemia, but studies show that other
cephalosporins, such as ceftriaxone [22] and cefaclor, cause
anemia [23]. A potential mechanism for this is the binding of
drug-induced antibodies to proteins on the membrane of red
blood cells, resulting in their elimination and causing druginduced immune hemolytic anemia [24]. Thus, cefathiamidine
should be further studied in a larger pediatric population in
order to confirm its role in inducing anemia.
Three other associations (with vancomycin, cefoperazonesulbactam and ibuprofen) were identified as potentially new
signals in children. These associations have already been
found reported in adults. The low use of these drugs in
children could be the reason for the lack of child-related
case reports. Vancomycin is a good treatment for serious
infections but its use is not very common in children due to
its nephrotoxicity [25], and it is reported to cause druginduced immune hemolytic anemia in adults [26].
Cefoperazone-sulbactam is the combined treatment of sulbactam and cefoperazone used against most multidrug-resistant
organisms [27]. One potential mechanism is that the chemical
structure of cefoperazone contains a side chain of
N-methylthiotetrazole which could inhibit vitamin K and result
in anemia [28]. Ibuprofen is the most widely used nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug for treating inflammation
[29]. Ibuprofen is reported to induce aplastic anemia [30]
and immune hemolytic anemia [31] in adults. In summary,
the information on the associations of the abovementioned
three drugs and anemia in the pediatric population is limited,
especially in Chinese population. This study will provide
a reference and support for further research.
Finally, the remaining four associations (with sulfamethoxazole, lysine acetylsalicylate, paracetamol, and ceftriaxone) were previously known in the context of anemia.
Sulfamethoxazole is indicated for the treatment of skin and
urinary and respiratory tract infections caused by methicillinresistant Staphylococcus aureus. Treatment with sulfamethoxazole was found to aggravate the hemolysis of patients with
the variants of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase [32],
and also caused megaloblastic anemia [33,34]. Lysine acetylsalicylate and paracetamol are non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs that can cause gastrointestinal bleeding
and anemia [35,36]. Lysine acetylsalicylate is a complex salt

998

D.-F. FAN ET AL.

of lysine and acetylsalicylate that is used for the treatment
of fever and mild to moderate pain. Acetylsalicylate has
been reported to cause anemia [37,38], and paracetamol
may cause hemolytic anemia in patients with glucose6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency [39,40]. Ceftriaxone
may induce hemolytic anemia in children, which would be
severe and could be fatal. Once anemia is suspected to be
caused by the drug, ceftriaxone treatment should be discontinued even if the symptoms appeared to be mild. The
application of the two-step method suggests that this
method leads to reliable results.

4.2. Strengths and limitations
With their increasing availability, EMRs have become
a complementary data source for drug safety surveillance
and signal detection. A wide range of data-mining methods
has been explored for safety signal detection using EMRs, such
as automatic laboratory signals [14] and natural language
processing [15]. Compared with these methods, the first step
in our approach is to screen potential drugs that may cause
anemia using a computer search. In addition, we exclude
several diseases of the blood system and tumors which
could directly affected the Hb concentration, including anemia, G6PD deficiency, hemoglobinopathy, malignant tumor,
leukemia, myeloma, thymoma, abnormal bone marrow, red
blood cell disease, DIC and hemophagocytic syndrome. We
also excluded drugs that directly affect hemoglobin concentration. This makes the research target-oriented, and, thus,
provides a more objective and accurate signal. Moreover, we
can apply our method to the monitoring of other adverse
reactions in the pediatric population in the future.
Performing large-scale drug ADR studies using the automatic
mining method remains challenging. Limitations include the
relatively small sample size of our study. This study was conducted on the basis of EMRs from a single hospital, and there
might be a potential bias due to the limitations of regional
representation. Consequently, it is unsurprising that monitoring
drugs with low prevalence would generate inaccurate results.
However, this problem may be improved by combining EMR
data from several health care institutions. The recently proposed
project ‘China ADR Sentinel Surveillance Alliance’ could solve this
limitation, as it aims to assess the safety of approved medical
products using existing EMR data from multiple sources in China.
Another limitation is that residual confounding could not be
excluded. Only abnormal Hb results, and not diseases or symptoms recorded in the EMRs, were used as a substitute for druginduced anemia in our study, and we did not assess the other
types for signals detected. When monitoring adverse reaction
signals using EMRs, information such as departments and drug
administrations were encoded into identifiable digital data for
analysis, and it is almost impossible to obtain information
describing drug treatment indications, any potential contraindications or disease severity, ect., which would be cause bias. Thus,
additional verification methods are needed in future studies to
reduce this bias.
Identifying ADRs accurately and timely is an ongoing challenge and it is critical for public safety. This study demonstrated
that it is feasible to detect known ADR signals as well as identify

new ADR signals using an EMR database focusing on pediatric
patients from a hospital information system. In this study, we
successfully identified nine drugs to be associated with anemia.
The association of three drugs (vancomycin, cefoperazonesulbactam and ibuprofen) and anemia was identified as new
signals in children, and the association of other two drugs (fluconazole and cefathiamidine) and anemia was identified as new
signals in both children and adults. All potential new signals
require further studies in a larger group of pediatric patients to
better reduce the bias and confounding. This study demonstrated that our method can be incorporated into a pediatric
pharmacovigilance system that is directly related to the EMR
database and can serve as a model for using EMRs and automatic
mining to effectively and timely monitor ADR signals. With the
existence of ubiquitous EMR data in the future, this data mining
method can provide valuable support for pharmacovigilance
studies. Furthermore, this study highlights the potential of monitoring drug safety signals in a real-world environment, which
may contribute greatly to pharmacovigilance in the future.
