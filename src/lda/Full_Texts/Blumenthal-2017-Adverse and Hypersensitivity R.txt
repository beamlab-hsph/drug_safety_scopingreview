Abstract
Author Manuscript

Background—Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are among the most frequently
used medications in the United States. NSAID use can be limited by adverse drug reactions
(ADRs), including hypersensitivity reactions (HSRs).
Objective—We aimed to use electronic health record (EHR) data to determine the incidence and
predictors of HSRs to prescription NSAIDs.

Author Manuscript

Methods—We performed a retrospective cohort study of all adult outpatients in a large
healthcare system prescribed diclofenac, indomethacin, nabumetone, or piroxicam between
January 1, 2004 and September 30, 2012. The primary outcome was an ADR or HSR attributed to
the prescribed NSAID within one year of prescription, determined from a longitudinal allergy
database. We used natural language processing to classify known ADRs as either HSRs or side
effects. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to identify independent risk factors for
NSAID HSRs.
Results—Of 62,719 patients prescribed NSAIDs, 1,035 (1.7%) had an ADR, of which 189
(18.3%) were HSRs. Multivariable regression analysis identified that patients with prior drug HSR
history (OR 1.8 [95% CI 1.3, 2.5]), female sex (OR 1.8 [95% CI 1.3, 2.4]), autoimmune disease
(OR 1.7 [95% CI 1.1, 2.7]), and those prescribed the maximum standing NSAID dose (OR 1.5
[95% CI 1.1, 2.0]) had increased odds of NSAID HSR.
Conclusions—NSAIDs therapeutic use can be limited by ADRs; About 1 in 5 NSAID ADRs is
an HSR. Both patient and drug factors contribute to HSR risk and are important to guide patient
counseling.

Introduction

Author Manuscript

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are among the most widely used
medications.1 NSAIDs can cause a variety of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) that range from
minor to severe.2-4 Reactions to NSAIDs include side effects (e.g., gastrointestinal upset,
bleeding, nephrotoxicity)1,5 as well as allergic or pseudoallergic reactions (i.e.,
hypersensitivity reactions [HSRs]).5 While some side effect reactions do not preclude future
use of NSAIDs, HSRs warrant particular caution, as allergic (i.e., immunoglobulin [Ig] Emediated) reactions predictably worsen with re-exposure and pseudoallergic reactions often
exhibit dose-dependent recurrence.6 NSAIDs have been identified as one of the most
common causes of drug-induced anaphylactic reactions.7,8
Prior studies suggest a 1.9-3.5% prevalence of self-reported allergy to NSAIDs,9-11 with two
studies finding self-reported incidence ranging from 0.2% to 6.0%.10,12 However, these
studies have included all “allergies” -- inclusive of both HSRs and side effects -- in their
frequency estimates. Additionally, although electronic health records (EHRs) contain both
coded and non-coded (i.e., free-text) data, prior incidence estimates of NSAID allergy from
EHR data used only coded elements, which may have underestimated HSR burden.

Previously reported risk factors for NSAID HSRs include chronic urticaria/angioedema,
prior HSRs, aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD), and atopy.6,13-18 One study
using United States insurance claims data identified that the NSAID indications of acute
pain and inflammatory arthritis increased the risk of NSAID HSRs.19 In the present study,
we applied novel informatics methods using EHR data to estimate the incidence of ADRs
and HSRs to prescription NSAIDs, and defined risk factors for developing these HSRs.

Methods
Study Design, Population

Author Manuscript

We performed a retrospective cohort study using the EHR data available within Partners
HealthCare System (PHS), an integrated health care delivery network in the Boston area of
the United States. In order to identify which NSAIDs to use for this study, we first identified
the most common NSAIDs in a cross-sectional analysis of the Partners Enterprise Allergy
Repository (PEAR), a database of allergy and adverse effect information that contains over
four million active allergy records for over two million PHS patients (Table E1 in the Online
Repository).11,20 Our analysis focused on NSAIDs that were: (1) prescription-only in the
United States, (2) inhibitors of both of the cyclooxygenase 1 and cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2)
enzymes, and (3) used predominantly by the oral route (i.e., PO). Diclofenac, indomethacin,
nabumetone, and piroxicam met these criteria and were included in this study.
The study population included all adult outpatients (age ≥ 18 years) prescribed any of the
four oral NSAIDs from January 1, 2004 through September 30, 2012, and who had at least
one visit within one year at any PHS outpatient clinic after the NSAID prescription.

Author Manuscript

We subsequently ran a separate analysis of patients prescribed only celecoxib or meloxicam,
two selective COX-2 inhibitors.
Primary Outcome

Author Manuscript

The primary outcome was an ADR or HSR to the prescribed NSAID within one year. We
chose to evaluate the fixed time-frame of one year to allow sufficient time for patients to
have a repeat visit and report an ADR/HSR. We identified ADRs and HSRs from PEAR,
which contained detailed symptoms reported by patients and/or observations made by
healthcare providers. PEAR reactions could be entered in a coded format that used a predefined list of reactions selected by providers for each drug, or a free-text format, which
comprised about 6% of entries. For free-text reaction entries, informatician investigators
(KL, LZ) used natural language processing algorithms to automatically map reactions to a
standardized form.11,21 For example, the free-text reaction “full body hives” was mapped to
the coded reaction “hives.” All mapped free-text reactions were manually verified by
another investigator (KGB).
We considered all PEAR reaction entries an ADR. We defined HSRs as the subset of ADRs
that included reactions mapped to anaphylaxis, hypotension, angioedema, swelling, rhinitis,
bronchospasm, asthma, wheezing, shortness of breath, hives, urticaria, itching, or rash.22 We
additionally considered non-immediate HSRs previously attributed to NSAIDs by
performing key word searches of the PEAR reaction field for serum sickness, drug rash

eosinophilia and systemic symptoms syndrome, erythema multiforme, acute interstitial
nephritis, fixed drug eruption, erythema nodosum, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic
epidermal necrolysis, pneumonitis, meningitits, lichenoid drug eruptions, and
leukocytoclastic vasculitits.6,23 Remaining known reactions were considered side effect
reactions, which we grouped and sorted by frequency. “Unknown” reactions were
considered separately, and could reflect that the patient and/or the provider did not know the
reaction details.
Because PEAR allows for drug class entries (e.g, NSAIDs) as well as specific drug entries
(e.g., diclofenac), we conducted a sensitivity analysis of ADR and HSR incidence by
assuming that all PEAR allergy entries of “NSAID” were related to the NSAID that was
prescribed. For this expanded definition, we similarly distinguished HSRs, side effects, and
unknown reactions.

Author Manuscript

We used identical methods to identify incidence of ADRs and HSRs among adult outpatients
prescribed only celecoxib or meloxicam from January 1, 2004 through September 30, 2012,
and who had at least one visit within one year at any PHS outpatient clinic after the
prescription.
Predictor Variables

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Age (at the time of first NSAID prescription), gender, and race/ethnicity were identified
from EHR demographic tables. We defined ADR and HSR histories using the PEAR
database. We identified NSAID treatment indications (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, joint pain,
chronic pain) as a coded or free-text entry into the EHR “Problem List” or presence of the
relevant code(s) from the International Classification of Diseases, ninth edition (ICD-9)
entered within 30 days of the NSAID prescription. All ICD-9 codes were informed by prior
studies, when available (Table E2 in the Online Repository). Patient comorbidities were
identified similarly, as either on the patient's “Problem List” or presence of a relevant ICD-9
code before the NSAID prescription date. To search AERD patients, we used key word
searches of the reaction field and a previously studied informatics algorithm.24 Using the
NSAID electronic prescription, we created a Food and Drug Administration “maximum
daily dose” for each NSAID: diclofenac 200 mg/day, indomethacin 150mg/day, nabumetone
2000mg/day, and piroxicam 20 mg/day.25 We used the EHR “Medication List” to define
medication-specific covariates, including any previous NSAID prescription (prescriptions
for over the counter NSAIDs such as ibuprofen and naproxen, when present, were included)
and concomitant medications, defined as an active EHR prescription for the medication
(aspirin, opiates, or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors) at the time of NSAID
prescription. Classification of drugs into the opiate and angiotensin-converting enzyme
inhibitor classes followed the American Hospital Formulary Service PharmacologicTherapeutic Classification.11,26
Statistical Analyses
Data are displayed as numbers with frequencies, and medians with inter-quartile ranges. For
the primary NSAID cohort, we compared binary variables using Fisher's exact test, nondichotomous categorical variables using chi-squared test, ordinal variables using the

Cochran-Armitage Trend test, and continuous variables using the Wilcoxon Rank Sum test.
To identify NSAID HSR risk factors, we created multivariable logistic regression models for
the primary outcome of HSR, first using the standard HSR definition, then using the
expanded HSR definition that included NSAID class allergies.
The regression models were built using both a priori knowledge and imbalances between
groups identified in univariable analyses. We used p˂0.05 as the screening criterion for each
potential covariate not informed by prior knowledge. Our final chosen models included all
variables significant at p<0.05 in at least one of the multivariable models. We calculated
odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals. P values <0.05 were considered statistically
significant. Statistical analyses were performed in SAS version 9.4 (Cary, NC, USA). This
study was approved by the Partners Institutional Review Board.

Results
Incidence and Phenotypes

Author Manuscript

Of 62,719 patients prescribed oral diclofenac, indomethacin, nabumetone, or piroxicam from
January 1, 2004 through September 30, 2012, 1,035 (1.7%) had an ADR (Table I). ADRs
included 189 patients (18.3% of ADRs; 0.3% incidence) with HSRs. HSRs included rash
(n=72, 38.1%), angioedema or swelling (n=51, 27.0%), urticaria or hives (n=37, 19.6%),
itching (n=28, 14.8%), shortness of breath, asthma or wheezing (n=12, 6.3%), and
anaphylaxis or hypotension (n=10, 5.3%). We identified only one non-immediate HSR,
serum sickness, in one patient. Among 801 patients who experienced side effect reactions,
the most common reactions were gastrointestinal upset (n=543, 67.8%), dizziness (n=59,
7.4%), headaches (n=52, 6.5%), mental status change (n=33, 4.1%), and renal toxicity
(n=31, 3.9%).
Using the expanded definition of NSAID ADRs/HSRs, incidence of NSAID ADRs was
1.8% and incidence of NSAID HSRs remained 0.3%, or 18.6% of ADRs.
Of 32,215 patients prescribed celecoxib or meloxicam from January 1, 2004 through
September 30, 2012, 429 (1.3%) had an ADR, of which 121 (28.2% of ADRs; 0.4%
incidence) had an HSR (Table E3). Using the expanded ADR/HSR definition, 616 (1.9%)
had an ADR, of which 163 (26.5% of ADRs; 0.5% incidence) were HSRs.
Factors Associated with NSAID HSRs

Author Manuscript

In univariable analyses, patients who developed an NSAID HSR were more commonly
female (Table II). Self reported race/ethnicity was imbalanced between HSR and non-HSR
groups; the frequency of Hispanic patients was lower in people experiencing an HSR than
those not experiencing one (2.1% vs 5.2%). Patients with an NSAID HSR had a median of 2
more office visits the year after prescription (p<0.001). NSAID HSR patients were more
likely to have any ADR history (p<0.001), more prior ADRs (p<0.001), prior NSAID ADRs
(p=0.03), any HSR history (p<0.001), more prior HSRs (p<0.001), and prior NSAID HSRs
(p=0.04). Patients with an NSAID HSR were more likely to be prescribed the NSAID for
rheumatoid arthritis (3.7% vs. 1.6%, p=0.03) and joint pain (15.9% vs. 10.0%, p=0.01).
NSAID HSR patients more likely to have autoimmune disease (11.6% vs. 6.1%, p=0.003).

We did not find a relationship between NSAID HSRs and atopy (20.6% vs. 17.0%, p=0.21)
or chronic urticaria/angioedema (0.5% vs 0.4%, p=0.50). One patient with an NSAID HSR
was identified with AERD. Patients with an NSAID HSR were more likely to have the
maximum NSAID dose prescribed (31.8% vs. 25.0%, p=0.04); HSR patients were more
likely to have previous exposure to NSAIDs and more prior NSAID prescriptions (p=0.03
and p=0.001, respectively). Patients with NSAID HSRs were not more likely to have
concomitant aspirin, opiate, or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor prescribed.

Author Manuscript

In multivariable logistic regression analysis, we identified that patients with prior drug HSR
history (OR 1.8 [95% CI 1.3, 2.5]), female sex (OR 1.8 [95% CI 1.3, 2.4]), autoimmune
disease (OR 1.7 [95% CI 1.1, 2.7]), and prescribed the maximum standing NSAID dose (OR
1.5 [95 % CI 1.1, 2.0], Table III) have an increased odds of NSAID HSR. Using the
expanded HSR definition led to a similar multivariable model with slightly lower OR
estimates for female sex and autoimmune disease, and approximately the same OR estimate
for prior drug HSR history. In the expanded model, prescribing the maximum standing
NSAID dose lost statistical significance (OR 1.3, 95% CI [1.0, 1.8], p=0.07).

Discussion
In this study, we used a large amount of EHR data to identify the reported incidence,
reaction types, and risk factors for HSRs to four prescription-only NSAIDs. We found that
while most patients tolerate their NSAID prescription, at least 1.7% of patients taking
NSAIDs reported an ADR. We used informatics techniques to identify that about one in 5
NSAID ADRs was likely an HSR. Finally, we identified risk factors for NSAID HSRs that
can be used to guide patient counseling, including prior drug HSR history, female sex,
autoimmune disease, and prescribing the maximum NSAID dose.

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Our observed one-year incidence of ADRs was 1.7%, and using an expanded definition,
ADR incidence was 1.8%. This estimate falls within the range of previously reported
estimates.10,12 We found NSAID side effect reactions, including some potentially mild (i.e.,
gastrointestinal complaints, dizziness, headache) and some potentially severe (e.g.,
nephrotoxicity) that are similar to prior data.1,12,25 Patients prescribed only COX-2
inhibitors had a lower overall one-year ADR incidence using the standard definition (1.3%),
although using the expanded definition, incidence was similar (1.9%). For these patients,
HSRs comprised a greater proportion of the ADRs (28.2% using the standard definition and
26.5% using the expanded definition). While not evaluated explicitly, this finding might be
explained by underlying differences in patients prescribed only COX-2 inhibitors (e.g.,
patients who have chronic urticaria/angioedema). Many patients who suffer NSAID ADRs
and/or HSRs have diagnoses that warrant continued NSAID use, which poses a barrier to
optimal medical treatment or presents a conflict with maintaining patient safety. Indeed,
NSAIDs are identified as the culprit drug responsible for 1 in 10 ADRs that require hospital
admission.2,3,5
In this study, we identified that about 1 in 5 NSAID ADRs was an HSR. Because NSAID
use is ubiquitous and increasing both nationally and internationally, awareness of NSAID
HSRs is clinically important. While this study is the first to define the proportion of NSAID

ADRs that are HSRs, the composition is similar to prior reported estimates of the general
contribution of drug hypersensitivity to adverse drug events.27 Although many patients with
HSRs to any NSAID must avoid the entire class of NSAIDs, some patients have an HSR to a
specific (i.e., singular) NSAID or group of NSAIDs with a shared chemical structure.13 The
current schema for categorizing NSAID HSRs includes four types of pseudoallergic
reactions (elicited by the enzymatic activity of the cyclooxygenase enzyme) and two allergic
reactions (presumed mediated by IgE).13,28 Pseudoallergic reactions specifically include
asthma and rhinosinusitis (type 1), NSAID-induced urticaria/angioedema in patients with
chronic urticaria (type 2), NSAID induced urtacaria/angioedema in otherwise asymptomatic
patients (type 3), and blended reactions involving mixed respiratory and cutaneous findings
(type 4). Allergic reactions include reactions to a single NSAID or group of NSAIDs with
similar chemical structure. Among allergic reactions, type 5 is urticaria or angioedema and
type 6 is anaphylaxis; however, type 5 and type 6 reactions are thought to be due to the same
IgE mechanism with different reaction severity.13,28,29 The systematic evaluation and
classification of patients with NSAID HSRs can help determine future viability of NSAIDs.
However, because of the complexity involved with classification of NSAID HSRs, patients
who require aspirin or NSAID treatment who have a prior NSAID HSR may benefit from
evaluation by an allergy specialist.6,30-34

Author Manuscript

We identified female sex as a risk factor for NSAID HSRs, which is consistent with previous
EHR-based reports.10,19,35 Prior drug allergy data have generally demonstrated that higher
doses and longer courses increase risk of HSRs.6,10,35 We similarly identified prescribing
the maximum NSAID dose was a risk factor for NSAID HSR. This observed “doseresponsiveness” suggests that many of the HSRs were likely pseudoallergic rather than IgEmediated. Additionally consistent with this hypothesis is that atopy, previously found to be
more common in IgE-mediated NSAID allergy, was not a significant predictor in this
cohort.18 One prior study using 11 ICD-9 HSR codes in a United States Medicaid dataset
found that rheumatoid arthritis increased odds of NSAID HSR.19 We similarly found
increased frequency of HSR with rheumatoid arthritis in univariable analysis, and
autoimmune disease was associated with a 60-70% increased odds of NSAID HSRs in
multivariable analysis. Defining the relationship between NSAID HSRs and autoimmune
disease is an important area for future prospective study.

Author Manuscript

Despite the clinical experience of allergists who evaluate patients with NSAID HSRs, we did
not find chronic urticaria/angioedema to increase odds of HSR. This could be due to variable
clinical documentation of chronic urticaria/angioedema in EHRs or provider awareness that
NSAIDs are relatively contraindicated in patients with chronic urticaria/angioedema. While
a validated, ICD-9 coding algorithm exists to identify chronic idiopathic urticaria using
EHRs, we found only 227 patients (0.4%) with the disease, and only one patient with
chronic urticaria/angioedema who developed an NSAID HSR. Although there is a welldefined relationship between nasal and respiratory HSR symptoms and AERD, we found
only one case of AERD in this cohort. It is possible that AERD patients were appropriately
not prescribed NSAIDs and therefore not represented in this cohort.24 Further studies that
assess NSAID prescription patterns among patients with chronic urticaria/angioedema and
AERD are required to further understand these findings. Acute pain, while a significant

predictor in the prior claims-based study,19 was not a predictor in this study; of 118 patients
identified in the cohort with acute pain, none developed an HSR.

There are several limitations to this analysis. First, the allergy data we used in this study are
not validated; drug and reaction data can be patient-reported and/or clinician-observed. The
data varies in quality and many healthcare team members lack drug allergy knowledge to
appropriately enter allergy assessments.36-38 Attribution of an ADR or HSR may not have
been correctly identified, and given the large-scale, retrospective nature of this study, no
formal causality assessment (e.g., Naranjo ADR probability scale or World Health
Organization causality criteria)39 would have been feasible. However, use of usual clinical
care allergy data has benefits; regardless of whether the association between the drug and
reaction is true, the patient's EHR report of NSAID allergy will impact future prescribing of
all NSAIDs, including aspirin.40,41 We chose to evaluate the allergy record at one fixed time
period after prescription (one year) because this would allow sufficient time for a patient to
visit a doctor in our healthcare system and report an ADR to NSAIDs. However, we still
may have missed minor reactions that patients did not remember at their visit or reactions
that patients discounted as not important. Because Partners HealthCare is an integrated yet
open healthcare system, we were also limited by not knowing patients' complete
medications, which could include outside hospital prescriptions and over the counter
medications, including other NSAIDs. While we chose to study prescription-only NSAIDs
and primarily report ADRs/HSRs to the identically prescribed NSAID (i.e., the standard
definition and analysis) to minimize the impact of this issue, all NSAIDs may not have
similar propensities to cause ADRs/HSRs.19,42 Incidence of ADRs and HSRs may have
been higher if we were able to evaluate aspirin, ibuprofen, and/or naproxen, the NSAIDs
with the highest prevalence of reported allergy in both the US and the PEAR database.11
Finally, we cannot exclude the possibility of selection bias towards patients that tolerate
NSAIDs, since 43% of patients had prior NSAIDs prescribed and presumably tolerated, and
17% of cohort patients were taking and tolerating aspirin.
By examining a large retrospective cohort of outpatients, we find that the 1-year incidence of
ADRs to prescription NSAIDs is 1.7-1.8%; 1 in 5 ADRs was an HSR. Patients prescribed
COX-2 inhibitors only had a similar incidence of ADRs (1.3-1.9%), although a greater
proportion of ADRs were HSRs. Our data identify NSAID HSR risk factors, including prior
drug HSR history, female sex, autoimmune disease, and prescribing the maximum NSAID
dose. Clinician awareness of NSAID hypersensitivity in patients with these risk factors
could guide patient counseling and safe prescribing practices.

Highlights Box
1. What is already known about this topic?
Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can cause a variety of adverse drug
reactions (ADRs), including side effects as well as allergic or pseudoallergic reactions
(hypersensitivity reactions [HSRs]).
2. What does this article add to our knowledge?
1.7% of patients prescribed diclofenac, indomethacin, nabumetone, or piroxicam have
ADRs, of which 18.3% are HSRs. Patients with prior HSRs, female sex, autoimmune
diseases, and those prescribed a high NSAID dose have an increased risk of NSAIDs
HSR.

Author Manuscript

3. How does this study impact current management guidelines?
Clinician awareness of NSAID hypersensitivity in patients with risk factors can guide
patient counseling and safe prescribing practices.
