Immune checkpoint inhibitors-related
myocarditis in patients with cancer: an
analysis of international spontaneous
reporting systems
Rulan Ma1†, Quanziang Wang2†, Deyu Meng2, Kang Li1* and Yong Zhang1*

Abstract
Background: Immune checkpoint inhibitors-induced myocarditis presents unique clinical challenges. Here, we
assessed post-marketing safety of cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein-4 (CTLA-4), programmed cell death-1
(PD-1), and programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitors by mining the real-world data reported in two
international pharmacovigilance databases.
Methods: We analyzed immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs)-associated fatal adverse drug events (ADEs) reports
from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) collected from July 1,
2014 to December 31, 2019 and data from EudraVigilance (EV) database accessed on February 29, 2020. Three
different data mining approaches were used to detect the signal of fatal myocarditis caused by ICIs.
Results: Based on 7613 ICIs-related ADEs reported to the EV database and 5786 ICIs-associated ADEs submitted to
the FAERS database, the most frequently reported ADE was ipilimumab-related colitis. For myocarditis, nivolumabassociated myocarditis was the most common. Among the five fatal toxic effects associated with ICIs, the lethality
rate of myocarditis was the highest. Therefore, we further analyzed ICI-associated myocarditis and found that elderly
patients and male patients were more likely to develop ICIs-related myocarditis. The results of signal detection
showed that the risk signal of avelumab-related myocarditis detected by reporting odds ratio (ROR) method and
proportional reporting ratios (PRR) method was the highest, whereas the signal strength of ipilimumab-related
myocarditis detected by Bayesian confidence propagation neural networks (BCPNN) method was the strongest.
Conclusion: The findings of this study indicated the potential safety issues of developing myocarditis when using
ICIs, which were consistent with the results of previous clinical trials and could provide a reference for clinical
workers when using ICIs.

Background
Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), such as cytotoxic Tlymphocyte-associated protein-4 (CTLA-4), programmed
cell death-1 (PD-1), and programmed death-ligand 1 (PDL1) inhibitors that can inhibit the co-inhibitory immune
checkpoint pathways have completely changed the treatment landscape of various malignant tumors [1]. However,
with the applications of ICIs increasing, immune-related
adverse events (irAEs) associated with ICIs can be induced
[2–4]. These irAEs may affect any body system and organ,
such as skin, lung, liver, gastrointestinal tract, and so on
[5–7]. Though the severe adverse events (AEs) related to
ICIs remaining rare, they can be fatal if these side effects
cannot be aware by clinicians when using these agents. A
systematic review and meta-analysis demonstrated that
the fatal ICIs-associated AEs were mainly colitis, hepatitis,
pneumonitis, myocarditis, and neurologic effects [5].
Among these fatal toxic effects, myocarditis had the highest fatality rate because it might cause fatal heart failure,
arrhythmias, and the like, thus drawing people’s attention
to this incident. Another research also highlighted the
high mortality rate of severe ICIs-associated myocarditis
[8]. However, the published articles about ICIs-related
myocarditis are mainly from case reports [9, 10] and clinical trials [11], which usually cannot detect the rare adverse drug reactions (ADRs) and reflect the real risk of
ICIs-associated AEs because of inherent limitations of case
reports and clinical trials (including limited sample size,
missing follow-up information, and the like). Therefore,
fatal ICIs-related myocarditis is necessary to be further investigated based on the data from the real-world scenario.
The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Adverse
Event Reporting System (FAERS) is one of the international spontaneous reporting systems, that is designed
to support the FDA’s post-marketing safety surveillance
program for drugs approved by the FDA. This database
includes all information on adverse drug events (ADEs)
and medication errors collected by the FDA. EudraVigilance
(EV) is another international spontaneous reporting pharmacovigilance database for ADEs maintained by the European
Medicines Agency. Data from these databases can be
acquired by the public and utilized to provide evidence for
the safe use of the drugs, especially for newly marketed drugs
and uncommon ADRs. The objective of this study was to
analyze the ICIs-associated myocarditis and to determine the
signal of ICIs-associated myocarditis by mining the data
reported in the spontaneous reporting systems.
Methods
Data sources and processing

Up until now, ICIs approved by FDA for antitumor treatment include pembrolizumab, nivolumab, atezolizumab, avelumab, durvalumab, cemiplimab, and ipilimumab. Therefore,
in this study, these seven ICIs were chosen as the study

drugs. Spontaneous ADE reports were retrieved from July 1,
2014 (considering the FDA marketing approval of the first
ICIs, pembrolizumab on September, 2014) to December 31,
2019 in the FAERS database (https://fis.fda.gov/extensions/
FPD-QDE-FAERS/FPD-QDE-FAERS.html), and EV (http://
www.adrreports.eu/en/search.html) was accessed and queried on February 29, 2020. In this study, the processing of data
downloaded from FAERS database followed the customized
strategy described previously [12]. Given that the drug names
in the EV and FAERS databases were not standardized, all
drug names were standardized into active substances with
relevant Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) codes
before data analysis. Besides, we detected and eliminated duplicates and multiple records (reports with at least overlaps
in 3 on 4 of considered key-fields, including event date, age,
gender, and reporter country). And the incomplete records
with missing event dates, age, gender, or reporter country
were removed for further study. Furthermore, all ADEs reported in these databases were coded by preferred terms
(PTs) from the Medical Dictionary for Drug Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). Previous studies have demonstrated several fatal ICIs-associated side effects, including myocarditis,
colitis, hepatitis, pneumonitis, nephritis, and so on [5, 6, 8].
Therefore, to identify the cases of fatal ICIs-associated ADRs,
we searched these spontaneous reporting pharmacovigilance
databases using the following MedDRA PTs: myocarditis,
colitis, hepatitis, pneumonitis, and nephritis. And these fatal
ICIs-associated ADRs were further analyzed in this study by
signal-detection algorithms.
Only FAERS, can realize signal detection by using
open database, but if you pay for it, other databases can
also do it. Therefore, this study used the open database
to obtain the number of fatal ICIs-associated ADRs in
two major databases, the fatality rate caused by ICIsassociated ADRs in EV database, the age and gender distribution of ICIs-associated myocarditis in EV and FAER
S databases, and the signal value of ICIs-associated myocarditis in FAERS database.

Data mining algorithm

The data mining methods used to detect the ADR
signals in spontaneous reporting systems are mainly the
disproportionality methods [13, 14], which are based on
spontaneous reports submitted for a lot of drugs and
ADRs [15]. All the reports included in the FAERS database from July 1, 2014 to December 31, 2019 were
selected to determine the ADR signals in the present
study.
To detect the ADRs signals, both Frequentist (nonBayesian) methods and Bayesian methods were used to
calculate disproportionality by using reporting odds ratio
(ROR) [16], proportional reporting ratios (PRR) [17], and
information component (IC) of Bayesian confidence

Ma et al. BMC Cancer

(2021) 21:38

propagation neural networks (BCPNN) [18], which were
mainly based on a two-by-two contingency table (Table
S1).
PRR and ROR have the advantages of easy calculation
and high sensitivity, and the results of PRR and ROR are
highly consistent. Therefore, PRR and ROR methods are
often used to estimate signals of ADRs. The calculation
formulas of ROR and PRR are ROR = (a/c)/(b/d), PRR =
a(c + d)/c(a + b), respectively. When an adverse event is
new and rare and the second row of two-by-two contingency table involves all drugs (that is, a or b in two-bytwo contingency table is a very small number, even
zero), PRR and ROR are not applicable. In this scenario,
BCPNN can be used to calculate the signal values of
ADRs [19]. BCPNN method uses the Bayesian discrimination principle based on the fourfold table. The core of
the BCPNN method is to calculate the value of IC. The
P x;y
calculation formula of the IC is IC = log2 ðPxPy
Þ. Since our
study involves some rare ICIs-related ADRs, we use all
three data mining methods to determine the signal values
at the same time.
For ROR, the threshold criteria of ADR signal are a ≥ 2
and the lower bound of the 95% two-sided confidence
interval (CI) is greater than one [12]. For PRR, the signal
judgment criteria are a ≥ 3, x2 ≥ 4, and PRR ≥ 2 [17]. For
the IC, the conditions for signal generation are IC > 0
and the lower bound of the 95% two-sided CI > 0 [20].
The higher the value, the stronger the signal appears to
be [12, 19].
MATLAB R2019b software was used to detect the
ADR signals in this study.

Results
Descriptive analysis

During the study period, a total of 7613 fatal ICIsassociated ADRs were reported to the EV system: 2849
(37.42%) for colitis, 2806(36.85%) for pneumonitis,
1022(13.42%) for hepatitis, 625(8.21%) for myocarditis,
and 311(4.09%) for nephritis. The 7613 reports consisted
of 2962(38.91%) for nivolumab, 1664(21.86%) for pembrolizumab, 1935(25.24%) for ipilimumab, 725(9.52%)
for durvalumab, 272(3.57%) for atezolizumab, 40(0.53%)
for avelumab, and 15(0.20%) for cemiplimab (Fig. 1A-C).
Besides, the FAERS database received a total of 5786
fatal ICIs-associated toxic effects. The total numbers of
ADR cases for colitis, pneumonitis, hepatitis, myocarditis, and nephritis were 2378(41.10%), 1939(33.51%),
666(11.51%), 610(10.54%), and 193(3.34%), respectively.
The most frequently reported drug was nivolumab
(2599,44.92%), followed by ipilimumab (1946,33.63%),
pembrolizumab (558,9.64%), atezolizumab (527,9.11%),
durvalumab (83,1.43%), avelumab (55,0.95%), and
cemiplimab (18,0.31%) (Fig. 2A-C). We noted that the

Page 3 of 9

most frequently reported fatal ICIs-associated ADR
was ipilimumab-related colitis, which was 1257 cases
of EV database and 1091 cases of the FAERS system.
Taken together, among the five fatal ICIs-associated
ADRs, colitis caused by ipilimumab was the most
common.
Lethality rates of five fatal ICIs-related ADRs

To determine the fatal risk, we measured the lethality
rates of five fatal ICIs-related ADRs reported in the EV
database. We found that although the number of ICIsrelated myocarditis was relatively low, its fatality rate
was the highest. The average fatality rate of myocarditis
caused by the target drugs was 21,76%. Besides, we
noted that the lethality rate of myocarditis caused by
avelumab was the highest (50%), followed by pembrolizumab (26.55%). Moreover, although the number of
ICIs-related colitis reports was the most, its fatality rate
was low. The fatality cases of cemiplimab were 0, which
might be related to its short time on the market. To
sum up, the fatality rate of myocarditis was the highest,
which was consistent with the results of the previous
study [5] (Fig. 3).
Characteristics of the patients with ICIs-related
myocarditis

Given that the fatality rate of myocarditis was the highest, we analyzed the characteristics of the patients with
ICIs-related myocarditis reported in two spontaneous
reporting databases. We found that patients over 64
years old are more likely to suffer ICIs-associated myocarditis, especially aged between 65 and 85 years old.
Besides, in terms of gender distribution, male patients
were more likely to develop myocarditis than female
patients (Table 1).
Signal mining of ICIs-associated myocarditis

ROR, PRR, and BCNPP methods were used to detect the
signal values of myocarditis associated with ICIs in the
FAERS database. Similar results emerged by using ROR
and PRR methods: the ROR value of myocarditis was
28.07 (95%CI 17.13,46.02) for avelumab, and the PRR for
myocarditis was 27.74 (17.02,45.19) for avelumab. The signal value of avelumab-related myocarditis was the highest,
whereas the signal value of pembrolizumab-related myocarditis was the weakest [11.44(8.57,15.31) for ROR and
11.39(8.52,15.22) for PRR] (Fig. 4A-B). The highest signal
value measured by the IC method was ipilimumab-related
myocarditis [4.33(4.09,4.57)] (Fig. 4C). It was worth noting
that the IC025 of cemiplimab-related myocarditis was less
than 0, so there was no signal generated.
Also, we use the signal mining methods to detect the
signal values of the other four fatal ADRs and found that
the signal value of ipilimumab-related colitis was the

highest, followed by atezolizumab-related nephritis
(Table S2).

Discussion
There is no doubt that immunotherapy based on ICIs
are the biggest breakthrough in the field of tumor treatment in recent years, which has brought a satisfactory
efficacy for the patients with advanced or refractory tumors and greatly improved the prognosis of the tumor
patients. However, the global increase in ICIs use not
only brings a satisfactory curative effect for tumor
patients but also brings a unique spectrum of fatal toxic
side-effects, such as myocarditis, colitis, pneumonitis,

hepatitis, and nephritis [6]. Although the risk for mortality
of ICIs-related fatal ADRs is lower than common oncologic interventions, clinicians need to raise the awareness
of the severity of these toxic effects.
Since human cardiomyocytes express immune checkpoint receptors, ICIs may cause fatal myocarditis while
eliminating cancer cells [21]. Several studies reported that
the myocarditis associated with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors
occurred to melanoma patients, which has aroused people’s attention [22–24]. A preclinical research revealed
that the left ventricle ejection fraction and global radial
strain in transplantable melanoma mice treated with antiPD-1 antibodies were reduced, compared to the control

and Drug Administration (FDA) Adverse Event Reporting System

group, and the analysis of metabolites and lipids indicated
dysfunctional energy metabolism, suggesting that immunotherapy based on PD-1 could disturb cardiac function and disrupt cardiomyocyte functional integrity [25].
Javid JJ et al. [8] identified 101 cases of reports submitted
to WHO-Vigibase. In these 101 reports of patients with
severe myocarditis after treatment with ICIs, most patients
(57%) received anti-PD-1 monotherapy, while 27% of patients received anti-PD-1/PD-L1 plus anti-CTLA-4 combination therapy. The results of this study showed that 46
patients died, and the mortality rate of patients with combination therapy was higher than that of patients with

monotherapy [8]. Besides, Wang DY et al. [5] retrieved
3545 ADRs reports related to immunosuppressive therapy
from 7 academic centers in the WHO-Vigbase database,
and systematically reviewed the published researches involved in ICIs. They found that the death of patients treated
with anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 antibodies was usually
caused by colitis [32 (37.0%)] and myocarditis [22 (25.0%)],
and the fatal toxic effects usually occurred early after therapy initiation for combination therapy. Among these fatal
ADRs, the lethality rate of myocarditis was the highest
[39.7% (52 of 131 reported cases)]. Furthermore, Mahmood
SS et al. [11] created a multicenter registry with 8 sites after

Ma et al. BMC Cancer

Fig. 3 Lethality rates of five fatal ICIs-associated adverse drug reactions

observing sporadic cases of ICIs-related myocarditis. 35 patients with ICIs-associated myocarditis were compared with
a random sample of 105 patients without myocarditis
treated by ICIs. All patients (29% for female patients) were
65 ± 13 years old, and 54% of patients had no other irAEs.
The results showed that the prevalence of myocarditis was
1.14% and the median time of onset was 34 days (interquartile range: 21 to 75 days). In addition, a recent review by
Raschi et al. [4] summarized several real-world studies
(that are focused on irAEs with checkpoint inhibitors)
described both rapid (median 16.5 days in combination regimens) and late myocarditis-related events
(median 178 days). Taken together, assessing the marketing safety of target drugs by mining the real-world
data reported in pharmacovigilance databases is of
great significance, and we can fully understand the
safety profiles of target drugs by signal detection.

In this study, we analyzed spontaneous reports of several ICIs-related fatal ADRs submitted to EV and FAERS
databases and detected signals of ICIs-associated myocarditis by data mining approaches. The findings showed
that a total of 7613 fatal ICIs-associated ADEs were
reported to the EV database, whereas a total of 5786
ICIs-related fatal toxic effects were submitted to the
FAERS database. Among these ADRs, the numbers of
ICIs-associated myocarditis were 625 for the EV system,
and 610 for the FAERS system, respectively. Although
the number of myocarditis reports was not the most, its
lethality was the highest, especially the mortality rate of
avelumab-related myocarditis was as high as 50%, suggesting that clinicians should take notice of these toxic
effects when using immune strategies based on ICIs for
tumor patients. We also noted that the most frequently
reported ADR was colitis, which was consistent with the

results of several systematic reviews [5, 26, 27]. Besides,
we found that elderly patients (older than 65-year-old),
especially those aged between 65 and 85 years old, were
more likely to suffer from myocarditis compared to
young patients by analyzing the characteristics of the patients who developed ICIs-associated myocarditis. This
could be partially explained by the fact that the immune
function of elderly is low and the tumor incidence rate
of elderly is higher than young people. Gender distribution of patients with ICIs-related myocarditis showed
that male patients were more likely to develop myocarditis compared to female patients, which might be associated with that men play a dominant role in the

development of acute myocarditis (sex ratio = 6.75, 8].
And this finding might also be related to the fact that the
incidence rate and mortality rate of malignant tumors in
males were higher compared to females [28]. Furthermore, the results of signal mining showed that the
signal value of avelumab-related myocarditis detected
by ROR and PRR methods was the highest, and the
highest signal value measured by the IC method was
ipilimumab-related myocarditis, suggesting that there
had a potential safety issue of myocarditis caused by
avelumab or ipilimumab. The fatality cases of
cemiplimab-related myocarditis were 0 and there was
no signal generated, which might be related to its

Ma et al. BMC Cancer

short time on the market, and further study needs to
be explored the risk of cemiplimab-related ADRs.
This study was mainly to analyze the post-marketing
safety of ICIs and detected signals of ICIs-associated
myocarditis reported in EV and FAERS databases via
ROR, PRR, and BCPNN methods. The data of this study
were obtained from two international pharmacovigilance
databases in the real world, which could provide evidence for the safe use of ICIs to some extent. However,
this study has several limitations. First of all, the ADR
reports submitted to the EV database and FAERS database usually conclude missing data, duplicate data, the
irregular spelling of drug and ADR names, and so on.
And most ADRs reports come from America and Europe, while there are few data from Asia or Africa. Secondly, although ROR, PRR, and IC are called
quantification signal detection approaches, they are only
simple indicators of potential safety issues and cannot
quantitatively calculate the incidence (occurrence rates)
and the risk of ADRs [4, 13]. Thirdly, although the pharmacovigilance databases are recognized as an important
tool to assess the post-marketing safety of drugs by data
mining algorithm and the signal detected by data mining
methods indicates that the target drug and the target
ADR are statistically correlated, it does not mean that
the target drug and the target ADR have a biological
causal relationship, which needs to be further observed
and verified through several large-scale clinical trials [4,
12].
Despite the limitations, the findings of this study indicated the potential safety issues of developing myocarditis when using ICIs, which was consistent with the
results of previous clinical trials and could provide a reference for clinical workers when using ICIs.

Conclusions
The results of this study showed that the application
of ICIs was associated with an increase in fatal toxic
effects, especially myocarditis, which was consistent
with previous studies. It was suggested that clinicians
should pay attention to these fatal ICIs-associated
ADRs and take preventive measures when treating
tumor patients with immunotherapy based on ICIs.
The findings of this study also provided objective evidence for post-marketing safety of ICIs, thereby ensuring the safe use of these drugs and improving the
prognosis of patients with cancer.
