Investigation of the occurrence time of adverse drug reactions helps to prevent the development and aggravation of adverse reactions, but the expression time of ganciclovir-induced adverse events has not been
elucidated. In this study, using databases of spontaneous adverse event reports, the Japanese Adverse Drug
Event Report database (JADER) and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)’s Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS), the incidence of adverse reactions due to ganciclovir and their expression time were
analyzed. As a result of calculation of the reporting odds ratio (ROR) and 95% conﬁdence interval for individual main adverse reactions of ganciclovir (cytopenia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, liver damage, and
acute renal failure), a signal was detected for all adverse reactions in both databases, except for liver damage in JADER. Furthermore, the Weibull distribution was performed for the analysis of onset time of each
ganciclovir-induced adverse event. The results of Weibull parameter α and β values of each adverse event
in both JADER and FAERS suggested that most adverse events occurred within 30 d and classiﬁed into the
early failure type, except that thrombocytopenia and acute renal failure in JADER classiﬁed into the random
failure type. Based on these ﬁndings, it concluded that the paying attention to signs of each ganciclovirinduced adverse event is required from the early phase after ganciclovir administration. However, in FAERS,
development after a long-term course also accounted for 11%, suggesting that long-term periodic monitoring
of adverse reactions would be also required.

INTRODUCTION
The use of ganciclovir for cytomegalovirus infection in
AIDS, organ transplantation (including hematopoietic stem
cell transplantation), and malignant tumors has been approved, and it is the ﬁrst choice for cytomegalovirus infection
in patients with immunodeﬁciency. On the other hand, the
development of adverse reactions, such as leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, liver dysfunction, and renal hypofunction, at a high frequency is described in the package insert
of ganciclovir. Clarifying expression time of the incidence of
these adverse reactions enables their prediction, and prevents
their development and aggravation to a serious state, facilitating continuous ganciclovir treatment. However, information
on onset time of adverse reactions cannot be acquired from
the package insert or interview form.
Spontaneous adverse event report databases aim at the
early discovery of adverse drug events and clariﬁcation of
their incidence, and adverse reaction data are accumulated in
great amounts by the regulatory authorities of each country.
In Japan, the Pharmaceutical and Medical Device Agency
(PMDA) has collected spontaneous adverse event reports of
drugs for medical use, non-prescription drugs, and drugs requiring guidance since 2004, and more than 300000 adverse
event reports are open to the public as the Japanese Adverse
Drug Event Report (JADER). JADER has been utilized in
many retrospective studies,1–3) playing a major role in the
safety evaluation of drugs in clinical practice sites in Japan.4)

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) opened the
FDA’s Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) to the public, which is also a spontaneous adverse event report database
similar to JADER.5,6) This system was started in 1996, and
data from more than 7 million reports have been collected
from the U.S. and other countries. Detecting adverse event
signals by data mining of the adverse reaction reports accumulated in these databases will enable the clariﬁcation of the
incidence of adverse drug events.4)
The aim of this study was to evaluate the expression time of
ganciclovir-induced adverse events by data mining of the adverse reaction reports, JADER, and FAERS. For this purpose,
the number of reported cases of the main adverse reactions
(cytopenia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, liver damage, and
acute renal failure) of ganciclovir in JADER and FAERS were
surveyed, and the incidence of these adverse reactions due
to ganciclovir and their expression time were evaluated. For
signal detection, the reporting odds ratio (ROR) and Weibull
distribution, which are frequently used in safety evaluation of
drugs, were calculated.7,8)

METHODS
Data Analyzed For JADER data, the database updated
in April 2016 was downloaded from the PMDA home page
(https://www.pmda.go.jp/index.html), and data registered between the 1st quarter of 2004 and the 4th quarter of 2015 were
used. For FAERS data, all reports registered by the 4th quar-

ter of 2015 were used. For summation and analysis, CzeekV
(https://www.czeek.com/) was employed.
The drug analyzed was ‘ganciclovir’ and only reports in
which ‘ganciclovir’ was described as the “suspected drug”
were extracted. From FAERS, reports were extracted as a
union of ganciclovir preparations among the countries. In
cooperation with Kyoto Constella Technologies Co., Ltd., the
names of 55 products containing ganciclovir (generic name)
were extracted.
For extraction of adverse events listed in JADER and
FAERS, the ICH Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities
(MedDRA) was used. For the names of adverse events included in the analysis, standardized MedDRA queries (SMQ), in
which MedDRA terms at the preferred term (PT) level were
grouped, was used,9) and the following 5 types were speciﬁed:
hematopoietic cytopenia (SMQ: 20000027), hematopoietic
leukopenia (SMQ: 20000030), hematopoietic thrombocytopenia (SMQ: 20000031), liver damage (SMQ: 20000005), and
acute renal failure (SMQ: 20000003). There are 2 ranges of
PT in SMQ: “narrow,” which is used to detect reports likely
to present the target adverse event, and “wide,” which is used
to detect all possible reports. To accurately identify adverse
reactions caused by ganciclovir, the range was speciﬁed to
“narrow.”
Aggregated Data The numbers of ‘all reported cases,’
‘reported cases regarding ganciclovir as the suspected drug,’
and ‘reported cases by SMQ analysis’ in JADER and FAERS
were summed.
Analytical Method To evaluate each item, the ROR and
its 95% conﬁdence interval (95% CI) were used. When the
lower limit of the 95% CI of the ROR exceeded 1, it was
judged as a signal.
Of reports of adverse reactions caused by ganciclovir, the
onset time was calculated for reports in which the onset date
of the adverse event, and dates of initiation and completion of
administration were described in year/month/day or in year
and month, and the numbers of cases were summed. The
onset time was calculated as ‘(onset date of adverse event)(date of initiation of administration) + 1,’ as a rule. In cases
with several initiation time points for ganciclovir administration, when the latest administration was initiated within 7 d
after completion of the earlier administration, the initiation
date of the earlier administration was substituted in the above
equation, and when the later administration was initiated 8 or
more days after than completion of the earlier administration,
the initiation date of the later administration was substituted.
When several PTs developed at the same time in a patient,
they were counted as 1 in the summation of onset time for
all ganciclovir patients. When different PTs included in the
Table 1.

Vol. 42, No. 11 (2019)

same SMQ developed at the same time in a patient, they were
counted as 1 in the summation of onset time by SMQ excluding the other PTs.
Time-to-onset analysis using the Weibull distribution was
performed, and the Weibull parameters α and β were calculated using JMP 14 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, U.S.A.).
The shape parameter β of the Weibull distribution represents
the failure rate distribution against time. The failure rate corresponds to the development of adverse reactions: when β is
less than 1 (the early failure type), the incidence decreases
with time; when β is equal to 1 (the random failure type), adverse reactions develop at a constant pace; and when β > 1, the
incidence decreases with time (the wear out failure type).10)

RESULTS
After excluding reports missing the age or sex, or those
with unclear descriptions of the age from all JADER and
FAERS data within the speciﬁed period, the total number of
target cases was 387162 and 7095703 in JADER and FAERS,
respectively (Table 1). Of these, the number of reports regarding ganciclovir as the suspected drug was 429 and 1505,
respectively. The total number of cases of each adverse event
was: cytopenia, 46914 and 230125, respectively; leukopenia,
29694 and 128261, respectively; thrombocytopenia, 15825 and
89265, respectively; liver damage, 36918 and 288090, respectively; and acute renal failure, 7405 and 161760, respectively
(Table 1). Of these, the number of adverse events regarding
ganciclovir as the suspected drug in each SMQ was: cytopenia, 273 and 467, respectively; leukopenia, 145 and 264,
respectively; thrombocytopenia, 62 and 115, respectively; liver
damage, 42 and 231, respectively; acute renal failure, 35 and
203, respectively (Table 1).
Number of Reported Cases and ROR (95% CI) of Each
SMQ When the ROR (95% CI) of each SMQ in JADER
(cytopenia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, liver damage, and
acute renal failure) was analyzed, signals were detected for
cytopenia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and acute renal failure (Table 1). In contrast, the ROR (95% CI) of liver damage
was 1.03 (0.75–1.42) with no signal detection (Table 1), suggesting that this adverse reaction is not speciﬁc to ganciclovir.
On the other hand, unlike the ROR (95% CI) of each SMQ
in the JADER analysis, signals were also detected for liver
damage (ROR (95% CI): 4.29 (3.73–4.93)), in addition to cytopenia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and acute renal failure.
Onset Time of Adverse Events The numbers of reported
cases of adverse events regarding ganciclovir as the suspected drug by onset time in JADER and FAERS are shown
in Figs. 1 and 2, respectively. In addition, the onset time of

each ganciclovir-induced adverse event was analyzed using
the Weibull distribution (Figs. S1, S2), and the Weibull distribution parameters are summarized in Table 2. The scale
parameter α values of total adverse events were within 30 in
both JADER and FAERS (JADER: (29.4 (24.8–34.7)), FAERS:
(26.9 (23.6–30.7)). In addition, the Weibull parameter α values
of each adverse event in both JADER and FAERS suggested
that most adverse events occurred within 30 d, except for liver
damage in JADER (α (95% CI): 48.4 (23.3–96.6)), acute renal
failure in JADER (α (95% CI): 32.8 (20.9–50.3)), and leukopenia in FAERS (α (95% CI): 33.7 (25.4–44.3)). Furthermore,
most β values of ganciclovir-induced adverse events in JADER
and FAERS were less than 1, except for thrombocytopenia (β
(95% CI): 1.15 (0.90–1.43)) and acute renal failure (β (95%
CI): 1.21 (0.82–1.66)) in JADER, suggesting that the onset
time of ganciclovir-induced adverse events is the early failure
type.

DISCUSSION
Although the therapeutic effects of ganciclovir for cytomegalovirus infection in immunodeﬁcient patients have been conﬁrmed, the incidence of adverse reactions is not low, which
is an obstacle for treatment continuation. In this study, using
the spontaneous adverse event report databases JADER and
FAERS, the incidence of adverse events due to ganciclovir as
the suspected drug and their expression time were analyzed.
In the package insert, adverse reactions that decrease each
blood cell type (cytopenia, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia), liver damage, and acute renal failure are described as important adverse reactions of ganciclovir. When the ROR was
calculated by these SMQ, signals were detected for cytopenia,
leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and acute renal failure, but no
signal was detected for liver damage in JADER (Table 1). In
FAERS, signals were detected for all SMQ, including liver
damage (Table 1). The range of the 95% CI of the ROR increases and signal detection becomes unlikely when the num-

ber of reported cases is small.11) The total number of reported
cases in FAERS was approximately 18-times that in JADER
(Table 1), suggesting that the range of the 95% CI of ROR
was higher in JADER because of a smaller total number of
reported cases, resulting in no signal detection. It is possible
that signals will be detected as the number of reported cases

increases in the future. Greater importance should be placed
on ROR signals with a lower 95% CI limit of 2 or higher.12)
The overall ROR of each SMQ exceeded 2 in both databases,
excluding liver damage in JADER, demonstrating that these
SMQ are representative adverse reactions of ganciclovir.
To properly use drugs, clariﬁcation of the onset time of

Biol. Pharm. Bull.

adverse reactions enables medical care workers, including
physicians and pharmacists, to take countermeasures against
adverse reactions, through which their development and aggravation of adverse reactions can be prevented.13) Focusing
on Figs. 1 and 2, approximately 60% of each adverse reaction
due to ganciclovir developed within 4 weeks, indicating that
the incidence of each adverse event seemed to be developed
at early time after ganciclovir administration. Recently, the
Weibull distribution is used to detect the signals for adverse
events by utilizing time-to-events date.14–17) Thus, we evaluated the time-to-onset of ganciclovir-induced adverse events
using Weibull distribution parameters. The results of both
scale parameter α and shape parameter β of total adverse
events in JADER suggested that ganciclovir-induced adverse
reactions including cytopenia, leukopenia and liver damage
develop early in most cases (the early failure type) (Table 2).
However, the β values (95% CI) of thrombocytopenia and
acute renal failure in JADER indicated that the incidence of
these adverse events were ‘the random failure type’ (Table 2).
On the other hand, all β values in FAERS were less than 1.
The contradictory results between JADER and FAERS may
be due to the difference in the number of reported cases. As
mentioned above, the number of cases inﬂuences the signal
detection when analyzing extracted data from big databases.
In the present study, the numbers of reported cases of thrombocytopenia and acute renal failure in FAERS were approximately 1.5- and 5-times larger than those in JADER (Table
2). Furthermore, all cases of thrombocytopenia in JADER
developed within 36 d after starting ganciclovir. Thus, sufﬁcient attention to signs of adverse reactions is needed from
the early phase when ganciclovir is administered. However, in
FAERS, approximately 11% of all cases developed after 113 d
(Fig. 2A), suggesting that long-term periodic monitoring may
be also necessary in addition to attention in the early phase.
The limitations of the present study must be noted. In this
study, we evaluated the comparative strength of relationship
between ganciclovir and adverse events using the ROR and
its 95% CI. Although the ROR provides sufﬁcient evidence to
examine the relationship between drugs and single event (adverse effect), a spontaneous reporting system contains numerous biases and confounding variables.18) In previous studies,
the ROR was adjusted by logistic regression analysis to minimize the effects of confounding variables when it detects the
comparative strength of the relationship between drugs and
adverse events.19,20) As the adjusted ROR is expected to provide more beneﬁcial information, further logistic regression
analyses, which include confounding variables—such as sex,
age, and concomitant drugs, are needed to detect the signals
of each ganciclovir-induced adverse effect.
Data from adverse reaction reports of ganciclovir from
Japan alone are insufﬁcient with regard to the number of reported cases. By adding the analytical results of overseas big
data, such as of FAERS, to the analytical results of JADER,
the incidences of adverse events can be clariﬁed. However,
the formulation, dose, racial difference, and the system and
method of spontaneous adverse reaction reports vary among
countries, and application of overseas data to clinical practice sites in Japan is difﬁcult. As accurate analysis of adverse
reactions in Japanese will become possible as the number of
reported cases of adverse reactions in Japan increases, actively
reporting adverse reactions of many drugs, not limited to gan-

ciclovir, may also be an important duty of pharmacists. Development of a method to apply overseas data to clinical practice
sites in Japan in consideration of formulations in other countries is also desired.
