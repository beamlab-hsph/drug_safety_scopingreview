Abstract
Background: Previously, adverse event reports (AERs) submitted to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
database were reviewed to confirm platinum agent-associated hypersensitivity reactions. The present study was
performed to confirm whether the database could suggest the hypersensitivity reactions caused by anticancer
agents, paclitaxel, docetaxel, procarbazine, asparaginase, teniposide, and etoposide.
Methods: After a revision of arbitrary drug names and the deletion of duplicated submissions, AERs involving
candidate agents were analyzed. The National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events
version 4.0 was applied to evaluate the susceptibility to hypersensitivity reactions, and standardized official
pharmacovigilance tools were used for quantitative detection of signals, i.e., drug-associated adverse events,
including the proportional reporting ratio, the reporting odds ratio, the information component given by a
Bayesian confidence propagation neural network, and the empirical Bayes geometric mean.
Results: Based on 1,644,220 AERs from 2004 to 2009, the signals were detected for paclitaxel-associated mild,
severe, and lethal hypersensitivity reactions, and docetaxel-associated lethal reactions. However, the total number
of adverse events occurring with procarbazine, asparaginase, teniposide, or etoposide was not large enough to
detect signals.
Conclusions: The FDA’s adverse event reporting system, AERS, and the data mining methods used herein are
useful for confirming drug-associated adverse events, but the number of co-occurrences is an important factor in
signal detection.

Background
Hypersensitivity reactions (HSRs), though rare in
response to anticancer agents, are caused by certain
classes of agents including platinum agents (cisplatin,
carboplatin, and oxaliplatin), taxanes (paclitaxel and
docetaxel), procarbazine and asparaginase, and epipodophyllotoxins (teniposide and etoposide) [1-5]. Despite
comparatively lower frequency, doxorubicin and 6-mercaptopurine are also recognized as infrequent contributors to HSRs, and additionally other agents, e.g., 5fluorouracil, cyclophosphamide and cytarabine, are
thought to be agents that can potentially result in HSRs
[1,3]. The use of the term “hypersensitivity” is widely

used in clinical reports, though its use is also sporadic,
and no exact definition is provided. It includes a wide
array of symptoms from mild flushing and itching to
lethal anaphylaxis. The pathogenic mechanisms by
which the reactions occur are still unclear, although
they seem to vary widely among agents. The exact prevalence of these reactions is difficult to evaluate, and
such a problems is hindering the establishment of
treatments.
Previously, pharmacoepidemiological studies have
been conducted to confirm that adverse events have
accompanied the use of cisplatin, carboplatin, and oxaliplatin [6,7]. More than a million case reports on adverse
events (AERs) submitted to the US Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) database were used, and a statistically significant association with an adverse event was
detected as a signal, by applying standardized official

pharmacovigilance methods [8-14]. This database relies
on reports of spontaneous adverse events to the FDA
generated by health professionals, consumers, and manufacturers, and the system is referred to as the Adverse
Event Reporting System (AERS). These platinum agents
have been proven to cause nausea, vomiting, acute renal
failure, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and peripheral
sensory neuropathy [6]. In terms of susceptibility, their
rank-order was consistent with clinical observations,
suggesting the usefulness of the AERS database and the
data mining method used [6]. The National Cancer
Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse
Events (NCI-CTCAE) version 4.0 was applied to evaluate the susceptibility to hypersensitivity reactions, and
carboplatin and oxaliplatin were proved to cause mild,
severe, or lethal reactions [7]. However, the same analytical method failed to detect signals for cisplatin-associated reactions [7]. In the present study, AERs
submitted to the FDA were analyzed to detect signals
for HSRs caused by paclitaxel, docetaxel, procarbazine,
asparaginase, teniposide, and etoposide, in order to
more clarify the critical factors to reproduce the clinical
observations on HSRs. Additionally, agents thought to
be associated with HSRs were also analyzed, including
doxorubicin, 6-mercaptopurine, 5-fluorouracil, cyclophosphamide and cytarabine.

were subjected to investigation as well as concomitant
drugs.

Methods

Data mining

Data sources

In pharmacovigilance analysis, data mining algorithms
have been developed to identify drug-associated adverse
events as signals that are reported more frequently than
expected by estimating expected reporting frequencies
on the basis of information on all drugs and all events
in the database [12-14]. For example, the proportional
reporting ratio (PRR) [8], the reporting odds ratio
(ROR) [9], the information component (IC) [10], and
the empirical Bayes geometric mean (EBGM) [11] are
widely used, and indeed, the PRR is currently used by
the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory
Agency (MHRA), UK, the ROR by the Netherlands
Pharmacovigilance Centre, the IC by the World Health
Organization (WHO), and the EBGM by the FDA.
All of these algorithms extract decision rules for signal
detection and/or calculate scores to measure the associations between drugs and adverse events from a twoby-two frequency table of counts that involve the presence or absence of a particular drug and a particular
event occurring in case reports. These algorithms, however, differ from one another in that the PRR and ROR
are frequentist (non-Bayesian), whereas the IC and
EBGM are Bayesian. In this section, only the scoring
thresholds used in the present study are given, and the
reader is referred to review articles for more extensive
details of each statistical test [12-14].

Input data for this study were taken from the public
release of the FDA’s AERS database, which covers the
period from the first quarter of 2004 through the end of
2009. The data structure of AERS is in compliance with
international safety reporting guidance, ICH E2B, consisting of 7 data sets; patient demographic and administrative information (DEMO), drug/biologic information
(DRUG), adverse events (REAC), patient outcomes
(OUTC), report sources (RPSR), drug therapy start and
end dates (THER), and indications for use/diagnosis
(INDI). The adverse events in REAC are coded using
preferred terms (PTs) in the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) terminology.
Prior to analysis, all drug names were unified into
generic names by a text-mining approach, because
AERS permits the registering of arbitrary drug names,
including trade names and abbreviations. Spelling errors
were detected by GNU Aspell and carefully confirmed
by working pharmacists. Foods, beverages, treatments (e.
g. X-ray radiation), and unspecified names (e.g., betablockers) were omitted for this study. Duplicated reports
were deleted according to FDA’s recommendation of
adopting the most recent CASE number, resulting in
the reduction of the number of AERs from 2,231,029 to
1,644,220. The primary and secondary suspected drugs

Definition of adverse events

According to the NCI-CTCAE version 4.0, AERs with
PT10020751/hypersensitivity in REAC were adopted as
the reports on mild HSRs, in which 19 lower level terms
(LLTs) were assigned in MedDRA version13.0, including
LLT10000656/acute allergic reaction, LLT10001718/
allergic reaction, LLT10020756/hypersensitivity reaction,
LLT10020759/hypersensitivity symptom, LLT10038195/
red neck syndrome, and LLT10046305/upper respiratory
tract hypersensitivity reaction (site unspecified). AERs
with PT10011906/death (with 13 LLTs) or death terms
in OUTC were excluded for mild HSRs. AERs with
PT10002198/anaphylactic reaction were adopted as the
reports on severe HSRs, in which 13 LLTs were
assigned, including LLT10000663/acute anaphylactic
reaction and LLT10002218/anaphylaxis. AERs both with
PT10020751/hypersensitivity, and with PT10011906/
death or death terms in OUTC were adopted as the
reports on lethal HSRs. Of note, LLT10001718/allergic
reaction and LLT10002218/anaphylaxis are also respectively assigned as allergic reactions and anaphylaxis in
the NCI-CTCAE version 4.0, and PTs in their higher
levels were used in this study.

Here, we define how a drug and associated adverse
event is classified as a signal when using each statistical
test. Using the PRR, a drug-event pair is classified as a
signal if the event count ≥ 3 and the PRR ≥ 2.0 with an
associated c2 value ≥ 4.0 [8]. Using the ROR, a signal is
detected if the lower bound of the 95% two-sided confidence interval (CI) exceeds 1 [9]. Signal detection using
the IC is done using the IC025 metric, a criterion indicating the lower bound of the 95% two-sided CI of the
IC, and a signal is detected with the IC025 value
exceeds 0 [10]. Finally, the EB05 metric, a lower onesided 95% confidence limit of EBGM [11], is used and a
signal is detected when EB05 is greater than or equal to
the threshold value 2.0.

Results
Table 1 lists the total number of adverse events occurring with each anticancer agent we investigated, and
therein the numbers of co-occurrences with mild, severe
or lethal HSRs. The total number of adverse events was
less than 10,000 for procarbazine, asparaginase, teniposide, and 6-mercaptopurine, and those occurring with
HSRs did not exceed 30 in total per agent. For etoposide
and cytarabine, about 30,000 adverse events were found
in total, but the number of HSRs co-occurrences
counted was only about 50.
The statistical data on 5 other agents, paclitaxel, docetaxel, doxorubicin, 5-fluorouracil, and cyclophospamide,
are summarized in Tables 2, 3 and 4. As shown in
Table 2, the signals were detected for paclitaxel- and 5fluorouracil-associated mild HSRs with 228 and 108 cooccurrences, respectively, but the association was only
marginal for the latter. No signals were detected for
docetaxel, doxorubicin, and cyclophospamide. As for
severe reaction, the signal was detected for paclitaxel,

Discussion
The AERS database covers several million case reports
on adverse events. Pharmacovigilance analysis aims to
search for previously unknown patterns and automatically detect important signals, i.e., drug-associated
adverse events, from such a large database. Recently
developed data mining tools for pharmacovigilance have
been successful at detecting signals that could not be
found by individual case reviews and that warrant
further investigation together with continuous surveillance. For this reason, data mining tools are being routinely used for pharmacovigilance, supporting signal
detection and decision-making at companies, regulatory
agencies, and pharmacovigilance centers [8-14]. Despite
some limitations inherent to spontaneous reporting, the
AERS database is a rich resource and the data mining
tools provide a powerful means of identifying potential
associations between drugs and adverse events.
Although HSRs are considered uncommon during
treatment with anticancer agents, platinum agents, taxanes, procarbazine, asparaginase, and epipodophyllotoxins are thought to increase the susceptibility to such
reactions [1-5]. Previously [7], and in this study, pharmacoepidemiological analyses were performed to confirm the HSRs caused by these agents, using more than
a million AERs submitted to the FDA. The NCI-CTCAE
version 4.0 was applied to evaluate the susceptibility to
HSRs. Carboplatin, oxaliplatin, and paclitaxel were statistically demonstrated to be associated with mild,
severe, and lethal HSRs, and docetaxel was associated
with lethal reactions. No signals were detected for cisplatin, procarbazine, asparaginase, teniposide, and etoposide. For these latter agents, the total number of cooccurrences with HSRs was less than 100. Although the
application of the NCI-CTCAE version 4.0 might have
the effect on reproducibility of clinical observations, the
total number of adverse events occurring with each
anticancer agent we investigated and the number of cooccurrences of HSRs would be important factors.
In this study, we tried to evaluate the demographic
effect on the susceptibility to severe HSRs. The ratio of
male/female/unknown was 22/49/8 for the patients with
paclitaxel-related severe HSR and the average value of
age was 57.4 ± 15.0 years. These values were not different from those for all AERs. Similarly to paclitaxel, we
could not figure out the effects of gender or age, in the
cases of docetaxel and 5-fluorouracil. Additionally, the
total number of drugs co-administered with 5-fluorouracil was 211 in 44 co-occurrences, and 29 of 211 was
oxaliplatin, which is a well-established cause of HSRs.

The co-administration drugs also can be confounding
factor, and further analysis should be done with much
larger numbers of co-occurrences.
Taxanes show poor water solubility, and are formulated with low molecular weight surfactants, for example, Cremophor EL and Tween 80 (polysorbate 80).
These surfactants might contribute to HSRs. Although it
is still controversial whether the surfactants or taxane
moiety is responsible for HSRs [3,4,15-17], the difference between paclitaxel and docetaxel with regard to
susceptibility might be explained by the surfactants
[3,4]. Recently, surfactant-free novel derivatives and formulations have been developed. Their safety profiles will
shed light on the debate about taxane-associated HSRs.
5-Fluorouracil, generally, is considered to be rarely
associated with HSRs, although there are scattered
reports of anaphylactic reactions occurring during or
after its intravenous administration [18-21]. However, in
this analysis, signals were detected for mild and lethal
HSRs, and the susceptibility was comparable with that

of docetaxel (Tables 2 and 4). This might be explained
by co-administered oxaliplatin as stated. 5-Fluorouracil
is used for cutaneous diseases such as psoriasis and actinic keratoses, and an irritant contact dermatitis is frequently seen [22-25]. This might be counted as
hypersensitivity. Furthermore, hand-foot syndrome, a
major adverse event of 5-fluorouracil, is characterized
by painful erythematous lesions which mainly affect palmoplantar surfaces [26-28]. This syndrome might affect
to analysis, because professionals could easily recognize
symptoms involving sweat-associated toxicity, which is
not a HSR, yet non-professionals might be mislead to
classify the symptom as a HSR.

Conclusions
AERs submitted to the FDA were analyzed using statistical techniques to establish the anticancer agent-associated HSRs. Based on 1,644,220 AERs from 2004 to
2009, the signals were detected for paclitaxel-associated
mild, severe, and lethal HSRs, and docetaxel-associated
