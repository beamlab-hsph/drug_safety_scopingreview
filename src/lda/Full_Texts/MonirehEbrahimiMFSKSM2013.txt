ABSTRACT

Many opinion mining systems and tools have been developed to provide the
user with the attitude of people toward entities and their attribute or the overall
polarity of document. Unlike explicit opinion mining limited work has been done on
implicit one. Similarly, few works has been done for opinion mining in medical
domain whereas it is a domain dependent task especially about implicit opinions.
Besides, side effects are one of critical measures to evaluate the patient’s opinion
about one drug. However, side effect recognition is challenging task since side
effects coincide with disease symptoms lexically and syntactically. In this regard,
this study tries to extract drug side effects from drug reviews as an integrable implicit
opinion word detection algorithm to a medical opinion mining system using rule
based and SVM algorithm. Developing each of these techniques requires different
preprocessing steps including corpus text segmentation, mapping medical terms to
concepts, trigger terms list construction and SVM feature extraction. Also, due to the
novelty of this issue, corpus construction carried out. The corpus used in this study
has 225 drug reviews manually annotated by a medication expert as a reference
standard. After corpus preprocessing, two proposed techniques has been run. In rule
based algorithm, regular expressions and trigger terms list has been used to detect
drug adverse side effects and discriminate them from disease symptoms. In the other
hand, combination of lexical, syntactical, contextual and semantic features leads to
the best results in SVM technique. The results show that SVM significantly performs
better than rule based algorithm. However, the results of both algorithms are
encouraging and a good foundation for future researches. Obviating the limitations
and exploiting combined approaches would improve the results.

ABSTRAK

Banyak sistem perlombongan pendapat dan alat telah dibangunkan untuk
menyediakan pengguna dengan sikap orang ke arah entiti dan sifat mereka atau
kutub keseluruhan dokumen. Berbeza dengan pendapat yang jelas kerja-kerja
perlombongan terhad telah dilakukan pada satu tersirat. Begitu juga, beberapa kerjakerja yang telah dilakukan untuk perlombongan pendapat dalam domain perubatan
sedangkan ia merupakan satu tugas yang domain bergantung terutama tentang
pendapat tersirat. Selain itu, kesan-kesan sampingan adalah salah satu daripada
langkah-langkah kritikal untuk menilai pendapat pesakit kira-kira satu dadah.
Bagaimanapun, bahagian pengiktirafan kesan tugas yang mencabar kerana kesan
sampingan yang bertepatan dengan gejala-gejala penyakit leksikal dan sintaksis.
Dalam hal ini, kajian ini cuba untuk mendapatkan kesan sampingan dadah daripada
ulasan dadah sebagai terkamir tersirat pendapat perkataan algoritma pengesanan
kepada sistem perlombongan pendapat perubatan menggunakan kaedah berdasarkan
dan algoritma SVM. Membangunkan setiap teknik memerlukan langkah-langkah pra
pemproses yang berbeza termasuk corpus pembahagian teks, pemetaan segi
perubatan kepada konsep, mencetuskan segi senarai pembinaan dan SVM ciri
pengekstrakan. Juga, disebabkan oleh sesuatu yang baru isu ini, corpus pembinaan
dijalankan. The corpus yang digunakan dalam kajian ini mempunyai 225 ulasan
dadah manual dijelaskan oleh pakar perubatan sebagai standard rujukan. Selepas pra
pemproses corpus, dua teknik yang dicadangkan telah dijalankan. Dalam kaedah
berasaskan algoritma, ungkapan biasa dan mencetuskan senarai istilah telah
digunakan untuk mengesan dadah kesan sampingan yang buruk dan membezakan
mereka daripada gejala-gejala penyakit. Di sisi lain, gabungan leksikal, sintaksis,
ciri-ciri konteks dan semantik membawa kepada hasil yang terbaik dalam teknik
SVM. Keputusan menunjukkan bahawa SVM ketara melakukan lebih baik daripada
algoritma berasaskan peraturan. Walau bagaimanapun, keputusan kedua-dua
algoritma yang menggalakkan dan asas yang baik untuk kajian masa depan.
Obviating batasan dan mengeksploitasi pendekatan gabungan akan meningkatkan
hasil.

CHAPTER 1

INTRODUCTION

1.1

Introduction

Decision making is the first and important stage of almost all human
activities. Human decisions are result of their view point and evaluation of the
situation and this evaluation to considerable degree is shaped based on the other’s
people opinion about the conditions. The explosive growth of social media in the
World Wide Web, change dramatically the people’s method to express their opinion
and consequently their decision making in their life.

Medical domain is not exclusive of this fact. With the vast amount of medical
online information and rapid growth of social media in this field, people no longer
use the drug before going to the Internet. They first search through bulk of
information to find “What other patients/physicians think about this drug?”. This is
just an example of many applications of online opinion in people’s today life.

However, extracting and analyzing opinions manually from the huge volume
of texts is a formidable or even impossible task. The aim of automatic sentiment
analysis (opinion mining) system is to provide the user with the attitude of people
toward entities and their attribute or the overall polarity of a document. It is an active
research area in natural language processing and text mining which involves several
subproblems. Unlike implicit opinion mining, a significant amount of research has
been done on explicit opinion mining. Similarly limited work has been done for

2
opinion mining in medical domain whereas it is a domain dependent task especially
about implicit opinions. Indeed, medical domain texts including drug reviews are full
of medical terms and side effects construct large portion of these terms. Side effects
can imply both positive and negative opinion about one drug. Even so, talking about
drug side effect is rarely positive and positive terms are more related to drug
effectiveness.

In this thesis we develop a system to detect side effects in the drug reviews as
a subtask of detecting implicit opinions in medical sources. We will also propose and
compare the regular based and classification approaches for recognizing adverse side
effects and discriminating them from disease symptoms.

1.2

Problem Background

The reason which provides strong motivation for research on this problem is
three-fold. The first angle is opinion mining previous works; due to this fact that this
problem is defined as a subtask for an opinion mining system. The main goal of a
whole opinion mining system is achieving to a high precision and recall in all of its
tasks. Opinion words play an integral role in these systems. Much of the work to date
zero in on extracting explicit opinions. However, to reach a high recall considering
implicit opinions is essential. So far, minimal work has been done in implicit
opinions and (Zhang & Liu, 2011a) is one of the few attempts to deal with this
problem. They propose statistical method to extract some noun product features that
imply opinion in four data sets including drug reviews. However, this work gives a
general approach for all domains whereas opinion mining (especially implicit
opinion mining) is a domain and context dependent task and to reach good and
applicable results it would be better to exploit some domain knowledge and features.

The second motivation is an importance of opinion mining on drug reviews
and a few accomplished works on it. Yalamanchi (2011) in his thesis develop a
system called Sideffective to crawl, rank and analyze patient’s sentiment about

3
medications from the side effect point of view. They extract the side effects without
using a precompiled list; search and rank the negativity of reviews with respect to
side effects using their proposed Negativity Meter formula. They apply a lexiconbased approach which considers side effect as a negative implicit opinion for
medicine but one of the main possible shortcomings of this approach is related to its
side effect extraction algorithm that is proposed by Rajagopalan (2011). In this
algorithm, they filter the most frequent side effects of one drug in order to remove
the disease symptom from the list of side effects. The hypothesis behind this
algorithm is that top side effect of one drug is a disease symptom that this drug will
cure. Although this assumption may be true in some cases, but the algorithm may
eliminate the top most important side effect of one drug in other cases.

The third motivation is related to the studies on side effect extraction and
differentiating between disease symptom and drug adverse reaction because of their
profound impact on the accuracy of implicit opinion detection. In this research
direction, Weeber et al. (2000) suggested a text based discovery system (DAD)
which was a concept-based NLP system for PubMed citations. He claimed that this
system has ability to discover new hidden association between adverse drug reaction
and a drug. Wang et al. (2010) took a different approach using statistical association
between extracted entities. They use co-occurrence criteria to detect the type of
relation between entities and use the section name where the entities occur to
increase the accuracy. In another work, Li (2011) extract side effects from online
patient drug reviews on a special class of drugs using statistical and parsing
techniques.

In summary, despite the importance of implicit opinion mining in medical
domain texts and the essential role of powerful side effect extraction algorithm in
achieving to this goal, yet there is possibly no such precise algorithm to detect drug
side effects in drug reviews. In fact, all of these existing algorithms consider disease
symptom as a drug side effect or focus on only one drug or are not capable to extract
all side effects. Therefore, using combined approach and considering the context is
essential in this regard. In this project, we will extract side effects from drug reviews
by detect and eliminating the disease symptom from the result list to increase the

4
accuracy of this algorithm. This algorithm can integrate as an implicit opinion word
detection part into medical opinion mining system.

1.3

Problem Statement

One issue that remains almost unexplored in medical opinion mining is
detecting implicit sentiment words and phrases which shows desirable or undesirable
facts about one medicine in the drug review. One group of these words and phrases
are drug side effects which cover large portion of drug reviews. On the other hand,
most of drug reviews are narrative and contain experiences of patients. So just
detecting these kinds of words is not solution to this problem. For instance some
sentences shows the general status of patients or their symptom before taking the
drug or many other situations that we should take into account. As an example in the
sentence “I take Alprazolam when I’m having anxieties about whatever it may be”,
“anxiety” is a disease symptom and the reason for taking this psychoactive drug by
the patient. Indeed, in this sentence the anxiety does not imply any opinion about the
related drug. In contrast, in the sentence “Two month into taking this pill, I started
having severe anxiety and anxiety attacks” which is part of a review on one birth
control drug, anxiety is a drug side effect and is used to show the negative opinion of
patient about the side effects of this drug. Therefore, despite the nonexistence of any
opinion word, this sentence is opinionated and a drug side effect should be
considered as a negative implicit opinion word in this context.

This thesis try to solve this problem by considering the context in which the
medical concept occurs to differentiate between disease-manifestation related
symptom (MRS) and drug-adverse drug event (ADE) and extract the second one as
sub problem in a medical opinion mining.

To address this issue, we propose two approaches. In the first one, we have
refined the idea of using regular expression for identifying contextual features from
clinical text suggested by Chapman et al. (2007).The second method is machine

5
learning approach using support vector machines (SVM). Finally we will compare
the results of two approaches from the precision and recall point of view.

There are two issues that can achieve the goal of this study: How can we
detect the medical concepts in the drug review that imply an opinion on the drug?
Which one is the better scheme for drug side effect extraction: regular expression or
machine learning approach?

1.4

Project Aim

The study aims to investigate the use of regular expression based and
machine learning (SVM) techniques for extracting drug side effects from drug
reviews as an integrable implicit opinion word detection algorithm to a medical
opinion mining system. The result of these two proposed algorithms will be
compared to achieve a side effect detection mechanism that guarantee tagging of
minimal disease symptom or other medical terms as a side effect (high precision)
while insuring drug side effects are not overlooked (high recall) for effective
recognition.

1.5

Project Objectives

Specific objectives of this project are:
1.

To develop regular expression based approach for the
purpose of detecting drug side effects.

2.

To develop machine learning approach for the same purpose.

3.

To compare both techniques for effective and efficient
detection of side effects.

6
1.6

Project Scope

1.

The corpus collection will contain 225 manually annotated drug
reviews collected from DrugRatingz.com.

2.

Two techniques will be developed: regular expression and machine
learning based.

3.

70 reviews will be used as a development set and 155 as a test set for
regular expression based scheme.

4.

Support vector machines (SVM) will be exploited for machine
learning based scheme.

5.

5-fold cross-validation will be used to perform the evaluation of the
SVM model.

6.

The MetaMap program will accomplish mapping of medical terms in
the drug reviews to UMLS concepts.

7.

1.7

Trigger terms list will be constructed for this project.

Significance of Project

The result of this study when integrate to a medical opinion mining system
can help not only the patients to assess the drug before taking it but also physicians
and drug producer organizations to consider user’s feedback in their decision
making. This algorithm can also be used in pharmacovigilance systems.

1.8

Organization of the Report

The thesis is organized as follow. Chapter 2 discusses the previous works and
literature review on existing techniques in opinion mining and in medical domain.

7
Chapter 3 explains the methodology of the project. Chapter 4 analyses the
experimental results. Finally, the conclusion of this study is given in chapter 5.
