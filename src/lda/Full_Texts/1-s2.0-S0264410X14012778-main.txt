Background: Trivalent live attenuated inﬂuenza vaccine (LAIV3) was licensed and recommended for use
in 2003 in children and adults 2–49 years of age. Post-licensure safety data have been limited, particularly
in adults.
Methods: We searched Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) for US reports after LAIV3 from
July 1, 2005–June 30, 2013 (eight inﬂuenza seasons) in adults aged ≥ 18 years old. We conducted descriptive analyses and clinically reviewed serious reports (i.e., death, life-threatening illness, hospitalization,
prolonged hospitalization, or permanent disability) and reports of selected conditions of interest. We used
empirical Bayesian data mining to identify adverse events (AEs) that were reported more frequently than
expected. We calculated crude AE reporting rates to VAERS by inﬂuenza season.
Results: During the study period, VAERS received 1207 LAIV3 reports in adults aged 18–49 years old;
107 (8.9%) were serious, including four death reports. The most commonly reported events were expired
drug administered (n = 207, 17%), headache (n = 192, 16%), and fever (n = 133, 11%). The most common
diagnostic categories for non-fatal serious reports were neurological (n = 40, 39%), cardiovascular (n = 14,
14%), and other non-infectious conditions (n = 20, 19%). We noted a higher proportion of Guillain–Barré
syndrome (GBS) and cardiovascular reports in the Department of Defense (DoD) population compared to
the civilian population. Data mining detected disproportional reporting of ataxia (n = 15); clinical review
revealed that ataxia was a component of diverse clinical entities including GBS.
Conclusions: Review of VAERS reports are reassuring, the only unexpected safety concern for LAIV3 identiﬁed was a higher than expected number of GBS reports in the DoD population, which is being investigated.
Reports of administration of expired LAIV3 represent administration errors and indicate the need for
education, training and screening regarding the approved indications.

1. Introduction
In 2003, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved
trivalent live attenuated inﬂuenza vaccine (LAIV3) for use in
healthy non-pregnant persons aged 5–49 years old, with expansion in 2007 to include persons aged 2–49 years old [1–3]. LAIV3 is
not indicated for pregnant women and persons with certain underlying medical conditions, (e.g. persons who have had severe allergic

reactions to the vaccine or its components and pregnant women)
[1–6]. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP)
includes LAIV3 as an option for inﬂuenza vaccination in approved
age and risk groups [2,5–8]. In 2012, the FDA licensed quadrivalent
live attenuated inﬂuenza vaccine (LAIV4), which includes the same
strains in trivalent inﬂuenza vaccine plus an additional type B virus
strain. LAIV4 replaced LAIV3 starting with the 2013–2014 inﬂuenza
season [9–12].
Pre-licensure clinical trials [4,5,8] and post-marketing assessments using data from the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System
(VAERS) in the ﬁrst 2 years after licensure indicated an acceptable safety proﬁle for LAIV3 in persons aged 5–49 years old [13].

However, rare adverse events (AEs) may not be detected until a
vaccine is widely used in the population [14]. A subsequent VAERS
review of LAIV3 safety in children using seven additional years of
data has been published [15].
We analyzed reports to VAERS following LAIV3 in persons aged
18–49 years to further assess the safety of LAIV3 in adults. In
conjunction with previous assessments, the ﬁndings of this LAIV3
safety review will provide comparative data for LAIV4 safety monitoring for the 2013–14 inﬂuenza season and beyond [9–12].

for 2005–2013 [20] with US Census Bureau population estimates
[21] for the 18–49 year old age group for the time period. The
number of LAIV3 doses administered to the DoD population by
inﬂuenza season was obtained from the Defense Medical Surveillance System (DMSS) (personal communication, Military Vaccine
Agency). Therefore, the denominator for crude AE reporting rates
by inﬂuenza season included estimates using NHIS and US Census
Bureau data combined with direct counts from DMSS.
2.4. Clinical review of reports

2. Methods
2.1. Data source
VAERS, co-administered by the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC) and FDA, is a national spontaneous reporting
system for monitoring adverse events (AEs) following vaccination
[14,16]. VAERS accepts reports from vaccine manufacturers, healthcare providers, vaccine recipients and others. VAERS data include
information on demographics of the person vaccinated (vaccinee),
the type of vaccine(s) received and details on the AE. Signs and
symptoms of AEs are coded using Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) terms [17]. A report may be assigned one
or more MedDRA preferred terms (PTs); MedDRA PTs are not medically conﬁrmed diagnoses. A report is classiﬁed as serious, if at
least one of the following is noted: death, life-threatening illness,
hospitalization, prolongation of hospitalization, or permanent disability [18]. For reports categorized as serious, with the exception
of reports submitted by vaccine manufacturers, medical records are
routinely requested and reviewed. For the purpose of this report,
“DoD population” will be used for both military personnel and DoD
beneﬁciaries unless otherwise noted.
We analyzed US VAERS reports received by September 30, 2013
for adults aged 18–49 years vaccinated with LAIV3 from July 1,
2005–June 30, 2013 (eight inﬂuenza seasons). We also conducted
a limited analysis of reports in adults aged >50 years old. LAIV3
is approved for individuals aged 2–49 years old so these individuals would have received LAIV3 in error or “off label.” Foreign
reports, duplicate reports, and reports with an unknown age were
excluded. We excluded reports that stated that the live or inactivated monovalent 2009 H1N1 (pandemic H1N1) inﬂuenza vaccines
were administered concomitantly with LAIV3. For serious reports,
we ascertained the primary event (the event that appeared to
prompt the report) and assigned a primary diagnostic category
using an approach previously described [19]. Cause of death was
determined based on information included in the autopsy report,
death certiﬁcate, or medical record.
VAERS is a routine surveillance program conducted as a public
health function and does not meet the deﬁnition of research; thus,
it is not subject to Institutional Review Board review and informed
consent requirements.
2.2. Descriptive analysis
We calculated descriptive statistics including mean and median
age of vaccinees, the most common MedDRA PTs, and the AE onset
interval (days from vaccination [day 0] until onset of ﬁrst symptom(s)).

We conducted clinical review of all serious reports. We also
reviewed reports with the following pre-speciﬁed AEs or conditions: anaphylaxis, Guillain–Barré syndrome (GBS), Bell’s palsy, and
LAIV3 vaccination of individuals in whom the vaccine is not indicated (e.g., pregnant women, those with a history of asthma). We
used speciﬁc MedDRA PTs to search for these pre-speciﬁed events
or conditions (Appendix 1). We classiﬁed reports of anaphylaxis
and GBS using the Brighton Collaboration case deﬁnitions or noted
a physician diagnosis [22,23].
2.5. Disproportionality analysis
We used empirical Bayesian data mining [24] to identify AEs
that were reported more frequently than expected following LAIV3,
compared with other vaccines. We applied criteria published by
Szarfman et al. [25].
3. Results
For the study period, VAERS received a total of 1362 LAIV3
reports in adults, of which 1207 were in individuals aged 18–49
years and 155 were in individuals aged >50 years (i.e., outside the
2–49 years age indication for LAIV3).
3.1. Reports in adults aged 18–49 years old
Of the 1207 reports, 562 (47%) were in males, and 107 (9%)
were serious, including four reports of death. In 965 (80%) reports,
LAIV3 was given without any other vaccines. The most frequently
reported MedDRA PTs were expired drug administered (n = 207,
17%) and headache (n = 192, 16%); in 109 (9%) reports no AE was
documented (Table 1).
3.1.1. Reporting rates
An estimated 7,316,278 LAIV3 doses were administered to civilian non-institutionalized adults aged 18–49 years and 6,904,844
doses to the DoD population (14,221,122 total doses) (Fig. 1). Crude
reporting rates for serious reports decreased from 1.6 per 100,000
LAIV3 doses administered in the 2005–2006 inﬂuenza season to
0.54 per 100,000 in 2012–2013 (Fig. 2). Similarly, crude reporting
rates for non-serious reports decreased from 15.6 to 4.8 per 100,000
LAIV3 doses administered. For non-serious reports we noted higher
reporting rates during the 2008–2009 inﬂuenza season compared
to 2006–2007 and 2010–13 seasons. The increase in reports in
2008–09 was driven by reports from DoD facilities that involved
administration of expired vaccine to a large number of individuals.
During 2008–2009 VAERS received 136 reports of expired drug of
which 122 (90%) were from DoD.

2.3. Adverse event reporting rates
We calculated crude AE reporting rates (number of LAIV3
reports per estimated LAIV3 doses administered), by inﬂuenza season in adults 18–49 years, for serious and non-serious reports. For
the civilian non-institutionalized population, we estimated vaccine
coverage based on the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS)

3.1.2. Clinical review
3.1.2.1. Death reports. We identiﬁed four reports of death following LAIV3 in adults 18–49 years. A 19-year-old female died 10
days after receiving LAIV3, quadrivalent human papillomavirus,
and meningococcal conjugate vaccines. Despite an extensive postmortem examination including microscopic, neuropathological,

toxicological, and chemical evaluation, the cause of death could
not be ascertained. A 25-year-old male with no concurrent illness or pre-existing medical conditions was found unresponsive
15 days after LAIV3 and Tdap vaccines. An autopsy revealed idiopathic mitral valve prolapse as the cause of death. A 21-year-old
male with a family history of heart disease died 3 days after
receiving LAIV3. An autopsy determined that the cause of death
was dilated cardiomyopathy. Eleven days after LAIV3, a previously
healthy 41-year-old male was hospitalized with acute respiratory
distress syndrome, severe hypoxemic respiratory failure, and possible community-acquired pneumonia. His condition deteriorated
and he died 21 days after vaccination. The death certiﬁcate indicated the immediate cause of death as respiratory failure due to
acute respiratory distress syndrome.
3.1.2.2. Non-fatal serious reports. Among 103 non-fatal serious
reports, the most common AE diagnostic categories included neurological (n = 40, 39%), and cardiovascular (n = 14, 14%). Among
the 40 neurological AEs, the most common diagnoses were
Guillain–Barré syndrome (N = 14) and Bell’s palsy (N = 7). Fourteen of the GBS reports, ﬁve of the Bell’s palsy reports and all
14 cardiovascular reports were in the DoD population. Six of 14
cardiovascular reports documented smallpox vaccine given concomitantly with LAIV3 (Table 2).

within minutes after receiving LAIV3, yellow fever, inactivated
poliovirus, and typhoid vaccines; and a 27-year-old female who
presented within 1 h after LAIV3. The ﬁrst two cases were determined to be Brighton Level 1 anaphylaxis, and the third did not
meet any Brighton level criteria. The remaining three reports were
non-serious and did not contain sufﬁcient information to conﬁrm
the diagnosis of anaphylaxis. All six patients reportedly recovered.
3.1.3.2. Guillain–Barré Syndrome (GBS). We veriﬁed 14 reports of
GBS following LAIV3, 13 of which were from the DoD population
(Table 3). Three reports met the Brighton Level 1 criteria; seven
met level 2, and four met Level 3. Five received only LAIV3 while
the remainder received other vaccines concomitantly. The median
onset interval from vaccination until ﬁrst symptom(s) was 31.0
days (range 1–73 days). Twelve reports had an onset interval within
42 days of vaccination, which has previously been proposed as a
plausible risk window for GBS following vaccination [28,29]. Six
reports described a concurrent upper respiratory infection or similar symptoms.
3.1.3.3. Bell’s palsy. We identiﬁed 10 reports of Bell’s palsy after
LAIV3; seven were serious and ﬁve were in females. The interval
from vaccination to onset of symptoms ranged from 0 to 48 days
(median 6 days). All received only LAIV3.
3.1.3.4. History of asthma, reactive airway disease, or wheezing. We
identiﬁed 20 reports involving LAIV3 vaccination of individuals
with a history of asthma, reactive airway disease, or wheezing.
Three of these events were reported as serious because of concomitant AEs: myopericarditis (also received concomitant smallpox
vaccine), diabetic ketoacidosis and type 1 diabetes mellitus, and
myocardial infarction. Among the 17 non-serious reports, nine
included respiratory conditions, of which four documented asthma
exacerbation. Other diagnoses included three reports of nonanaphylaxis allergic reaction, and one report each of epistaxis,
syncope, nausea and vomiting, trigeminal neuralgia, and inadvertent exposure to LAIV3 during pregnancy with no AE reported.
3.1.3.5. Pregnancy. We identiﬁed 106 reports of pregnant women
receiving LAIV3. In one report of spontaneous abortion (SAB) the
patient required hospitalization. In 88 (83%) reports, no AE was
documented. In the 16 remaining non-serious reports the patients
were not hospitalized and included SAB (n = 3), threatened abortion
(n = 2), respiratory conditions (n = 4), and one report each of pharyngeal pain, malaise, vomiting and diarrhea, sinusitis, headache,
vaginal discharge with cramps, and an unspeciﬁed complication of
pregnancy.
3.1.4. Vaccination errors
Among vaccination errors we identiﬁed 207 LAIV3 reports of
expired vaccine being administered. No AEs were reported with the
exception of one report of throat irritation in a 47-year-old female.

The period beyond expiration ranged from 1 day to 8 months, but
the majority of vaccinations were within 30 days after expiration
date. We also identiﬁed 155 AEs in adults aged >50 years of which
two (1%) were serious.
3.2. Disproportionality analysis
Empirical Bayesian data mining identiﬁed 16 MedDRA PTs with
an EB05 >2. Nine of these MedDRA PTs were signs and symptoms that were observed during pre-licensure clinical trials and
are included in the manufacturer’s package insert (e.g., epistaxis),
and therefore were not further assessed. Three other MedDRA PTs
referred to laboratory tests and are not AEs per se, and another
three were medication errors that are discussed elsewhere. The
last MedDRA PT with an EB05 >2 was ataxia. Clinical review
of the 15 ataxia reports revealed that ataxia was a component
of a broader clinical entity: GBS (nine cases), and one report
each of post-vaccination encephalitis, post-vaccination cerebellitis,
acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM), transverse myelitis
versus ADEM, neurologic deﬁcit, and ataxia with mental confusion. All these events, with the exception of ataxia with mental
confusion, were serious and resulted in hospitalization.
4. Discussion
Our review of reports after LAIV3 in VAERS for adults aged 18–49
years vaccinated during the period July 1, 2005–June 30, 2013 (eight
recent inﬂuenza seasons) adds to the body of evidence on the safety
of LAIV3 [13,26,27]. Just over 91% of reports were non-serious and
overall the most common signs and symptoms were headache,
fever, and nausea. The most common non-fatal serious reports were
categorized as neurological followed by respiratory. We noted a
higher number of GBS and cardiovascular event reports coming
from the DoD population compared to the civilian population. DoD
data are ascertained when a report indicates that a vaccine was
administered at a “military clinic/hospital” or purchased by “military funds”; therefore, it is not possible to distinguish between
military personnel and DoD beneﬁciaries. Through data mining
analysis we identiﬁed disproportionate reporting for the MedDRA
PT ataxia which appeared to be driven by GBS reports that are also
being coded with ataxia. Although data mining did not identify disproportionate reporting for GBS we observed a higher proportion in
the DoD population compared with the civilian population; mostly
among young adults.
GBS is an acute, immune-mediated demyelinating disorder of
the peripheral nervous system which has been previously associated with receipt of trivalent inactivated inﬂuenza vaccine (IIV3)
[28]. The attributable risk of GBS in adults after IIV3 is on the order of
one additional case per million doses administered [29,30]. A study
using a DoD medical encounters database found a slightly higher
incidence of GBS among military personnel than in the general
population [31]. Although this could partially explain the apparent differences in reporting of GBS following LAIV3 in the DoD
population compared to the civilian population in our study, the
ﬁnding may also be due to enhanced surveillance and reporting by
DoD healthcare providers, as a result of an aggressive education
and outreach effort by the DoD to raise awareness of serious AEs
and encourage reporting to VAERS [32]. Further evaluation of GBS
following LAIV3 in DoD personnel is ongoing.
Among fatal and non-fatal serious reports, cardiovascular
conditions were only reported among the DoD population. Smallpox vaccination has been associated with an increased risk of
myo/pericarditis [33,34], and in six of 14 (43%) cardiovascular
reports, smallpox vaccine was given concomitantly with LAIV3.
Anaphylaxis may be causally associated with vaccination in rare

P. Haber et al. / Vaccine 32 (2014) 6499–6504

instances [29]. Although our review identiﬁed six LAIV reports of
anaphylaxis, concomitant administration of other vaccines made it
difﬁcult to assess the speciﬁc contribution of LAIV3 to the outcome.
Bell’s palsy, a mononeuropathy of the VII (facial) cranial nerve, has
been associated with a variety of diseases. A safety assessment of
LAIV3 during the ﬁrst 2 years post-licensure found a limited number of Bell’s palsy cases [13]. We identiﬁed seven reports of Bell’s
palsy over the course of eight additional inﬂuenza seasons. We also
identiﬁed reports of asthma and/or wheezing in persons with a history of asthma and/or reactive airway disease. The manufacturer’s
package insert for the 2012–2013 vaccine [3] section on Warning
and Precautions states: persons of any age with asthma may be at
increased risk of wheezing following the administration of LAIV3.
However, an earlier VAERS LAIV3 post-licensure review did not
identify post vaccination asthma episodes in adults [13]. Similarly,
other post-licensure studies did not report any such AEs [15,29].
LAIV3 is not recommended in pregnancy. However, exposure
to LAIV3 does occur, likely from inadvertent use in women who
are unaware they are pregnant at the time of vaccination and/or
whose healthcare provider is unaware the patient is pregnant [35].
We identiﬁed 106 reports of pregnant women who received LAIV3,
most of whom (83%) did not describe an AE.
Administration of expired vaccine was the single most common
MedDRA PT for medication error following LAIV3 [36]. The increase
in expired vaccine reports in 2008–2009, was driven largely by
reports from the DoD, was likely related to the shortened shelf-life
for the refrigerated formulation of LAIV3 (4.5 months) compared
to that of the previous frozen formulation (6 months) and an
increase in use of LAIV3 by the DoD during the 2008–2009 season
due to delays in the availability of inactivated inﬂuenza vaccine:
(http://www.vaccines.mil/documents/1221ﬂu policy 2008 09.pdf).
A further contributing factor may have been lack of awareness
of the shorter shelf-life for LAIV3 (4.5 months) compared to
inactivated inﬂuenza vaccines (through June 30 of each inﬂuenza
season regardless of the date of manufacture) [3]. Although the
administration of expired LAIV3 might potentially result in lack
of protection against inﬂuenza disease, vaccination errors are not
considered AEs per se. [3]
VAERS is subject to certain limitations, including limitations
of passive surveillance in general, such as underreporting, incomplete information, varying quality of reports, and the lack of an
unexposed comparison group [14,16]. In addition, since manufacturers conduct their own follow-up for serious reports and VAERS
receives only summary reports, most serious manufacturer reports
are excluded from the clinical assessment. Also, it is usually not
possible to assess spontaneous reports to VAERS for causal associations between vaccines and AEs. However, as a national surveillance
system, VAERS can rapidly detect rare AEs and other potential vaccine safety problems, which can be further explored in carefully
designed epidemiological studies.
The ﬁndings of our VAERS review of LAIV3 in adults aged 18–49
years are reassuring and are generally consistent with previously
reported pre- and post-licensure studies that suggest that LAIV3
has a favorable safety proﬁle when used according to its labeled
indications. Our results will serve as an important comparator for
monitoring the safety of LAIV4 which replaced LAIV3 beginning
with the 2013–2014 inﬂuenza season.
