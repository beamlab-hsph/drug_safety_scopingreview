Abstract
Author Manuscript

Polypharmacy is common, and may modify mechanisms of drug-induced liver injury. We
examined the effect of these drug–drug interactions on liver safety reports of four drugs highly
associated with hepatotoxicity. In the WHO VigiBase™, liver event reports were examined for
acetaminophen, isoniazid, valproic acid, and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid. Then, we evaluated the
liver event reporting frequency of these 4 drugs in the presence of co-reported medications. Each
of the 4 primary drugs was reported as having more than 2000 liver events, and co-reported with
more than 600 different medications. Overall, the effect of 2275 co-reported drugs (316 drug
classes) on the reporting frequency was analyzed. Decreased liver event reporting frequency was
associated with 245 drugs/122 drug classes, including anti-TNFα, opioids, and folic acid.
Increased liver event reporting frequency was associated with 170 drugs/82 drug classes; in

particular, halogenated hydrocarbons, carboxamides, and bile acid sequestrants. After adjusting
for age, gender, and other co-reported drug classes, multiple co-reported drug classes were
significantly associated with decreased/increased liver event reporting frequency in a drugspecific/unspecific manner. In conclusion, co-reported medications were associated with changes
in the liver event reporting frequency of drugs commonly associated with hepatotoxicity,
suggesting that comedications may modify drug hepatic safety.

1. Introduction

Author Manuscript

Drug-related adverse events are a critical public health problem. In the US, serious and fatal
adverse drug events (ADE) increased nearly 3-fold between 1998 and 2005, with most
events due to a minority of important drugs (Moore et al., 2007). In the UK, 6.5% of adult
hospital admissions were due to adverse drug reactions, resulting in an estimated $700
million annual cost (Pirmohamed et al., 2004). Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) is one of
the most common adverse drug reactions, and can result in drug non-approvals, withdrawals
and warnings (Senior, 2007). Drug-induced liver injury is the top cause of acute liver failure
resulting in transplantation in the US and is associated with significant mortality (Carey et
al., 2008). In the US, the drugs most frequently associated with acute liver failure include:
acetaminophen, antimicrobials, anti-epileptics, psychotropics, and antimetabolites (Reuben
et al., 2010). However, most drug classes can cause drug-induced liver injury (Suzuki et al.,
2010).
In parallel with rising adverse drug events, the use of prescription medications, over-thecounter products and dietary supplements have also increased (Qato et al., 2008). The
average elderly outpatient consumes 4 medications or more daily (Gurwitz et al., 2003;
Hauben, 2003; Argikar and Remmel, 2009; Aleo et al., 2014; Chalasani et al., 2014), and
most (63%) use complementary and alternative medications (Cheung et al., 2007), which
have been increasingly associated with liver injury (Navarro et al., 2014). This
polypharmacy contributes to adverse drug reactions (Gurwitz et al., 2003); large population
studies reveal a sixfold increased injury risk with coadministration of medications associated
with hepatotoxicity (de Abajo et al., 2004). Therefore, it is helpful to understand potential
drug–drug interactions, which may contribute to drug-induced liver injury.

While drug-induced liver injury is clinically important, it is relatively uncommon, with
symptomatic injury affecting approximately 1 in 10,000 patients annually (Sgro et al.,
2002). In those with symptomatic drug-induced liver injury followed for 6 months, 1 in 14
will progress to liver transplant or liver-related death and nearly 1 in 5 of those remaining
develop evidence of chronic injury (Fontana, 2014). With increasing polypharmacy
potentially increasing the frequency of drug interactions and the likelihood of drug induced
liver injury, it is imperative to examine the effect of concomitant medications on druginduced liver injury in very large datasets. Therefore, we investigated the effect of

comedications on selected drug-induced liver injury events using the largest global
spontaneous adverse event reporting system, with over 8 million case reports. While
analysis of this dataset does not enable causality assessment, it identifies new hypotheses on
the effects of comedications on drug-induced liver injury.

Author Manuscript

Using this large global dataset, we applied quantitative signal detection methods to identify
liver adverse events reported for 4 drugs commonly associated with hepatotoxicity:
acetaminophen, isoniazid, valproic acid, and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid. These four drugs
were chosen to illustrate different types of hepatotoxicity: acetaminophen causes direct
dose-related toxicity, as well as hepatocellular injury at therapeutic doses (Watkins et al.,
2006); isoniazid exhibits hepatocellular injury due to metabolic and epigenetic factors
(Murata et al., 2007) which increases with aging (Uetrecht and Naisbitt, 2013); amoxicillin/
clavulanic acid is associated with an hepatocellular, mixed and cholestatic injury with
immunologic manifestations (Lucena et al., 2011) and is the most frequently identified drug
causing drug-induced liver injury in Western registries (Chalasani et al., 2014); and
valproate acid causes mitochondrial toxicity, particularly in infants and young children
(Uetrecht and Naisbitt, 2013). Furthermore, antibiotics and antiepileptics account for >60%
of drug-induced liver injury in a prospective US registry (Chalasani et al., 2014). We
systematically investigated the impact of comedications on liver event reporting frequency,
to identify drugs and drug classes, which were associated with increased or decreased liver
event reporting frequency. We then examined the identified comedications and constructed a
plausible conceptual framework to explain mechanisms by which they might alter liver
injury caused by the 4 primary drugs, in order to provide testable hypotheses for future
empirical research and structure future investigations of human drug-induced liver injury.

2. Methods
2.1. Study design
This data-mining study used the released version of the large global VigiBase™ database, a
spontaneous adverse event reporting system. We performed data-mining analyses to
quantify liver event reports for 4 primary drugs, which are known human hepatotoxicants:
acetaminophen, isoniazid, valproic acid, and amoxicillin/ clavulanic acid. We then explored
the potential impact of concomitant medications on liver event reporting frequency using
individual comedications as well as drug classes, as outlined below.
This study did not breach the confidentiality or anonymity of reported cases. The study was
conducted using only coded data, without accessing identifiable private information, and
therefore did not involve human subjects [45 CFR 46.102(f)].

2.2. Data source
We used the WHO global individual case safety report database (VigiBase™, the fourth
quarter issue of 2010), which is broadly utilized in pharmacovigilance research (Bjornsson
and Olsson, 2006; Suzuki et al., 2010). VigiBase™ is the world’s largest spontaneous
adverse event reporting system, with more than 8.4 million reports from 104 countries
compiled since the WHO International Drug Monitoring Programme started in 1968 (Caster

et al., 2014). The majority of database reports were received from Europe and North
America; both regulatory and voluntary sources are included.
2.3. Primary study drugs

Author Manuscript

We investigated four drugs commonly associated with clinical hepatotoxicity:
acetaminophen, isoniazid, valproic acid, and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (Suzuki et al.,
2010). Acetaminophen, isoniazid, and valproic acid predominantly cause hepatocellular
injury (Chalasani et al., 2014). Amoxicillin/clavulanic acid causes both hepatocellular and
cholestatic injury, with cholestatic injury predominant in the elderly (Lucena et al., 2006).
We used a single compound as a reference drug for acetaminophen, isoniazid, and valproic
acid, and combined two drugs ‘Amoxicillin and Clavulanic Acid’ and ‘Amoxicillin and
Clavulanate Potassium’ as a pooled reference for amoxicillin/clavulanic acid. For these four
drugs, known drug: drug interactions were searched in Drug Bank (Law et al., 2014) and the
Indiana University Division of Clinical Pharmacology P450 Drug Interaction Table website
(Indiana University, 2015). These known interactions were then compared to potential
drug:drug interactions identified through our data mining analysis.
2.4. Drug dictionary and classification
In the individual drug analyses, we used generic/abridged drug names, which are available
in a pharmacovigilance application used for the analyses (Empirica™ Signal, Oracle,
Waltham, MA, USA). In the drug class analyses, we classified co-reported medications
(comedications, hereafter) using the fourth category of the Anatomical Therapeutic
Chemical Classification (ATC4) of the WHO Drug Dictionary, which describes chemical
subgroups (Dictionary, 2014). Drug classes were excluded when indicated only for skin,
eye, or ears.

Author Manuscript

2.5. Liver events
Two custom liver event terms were created for data mining, combining groups of ‘Preferred
Terms’ (codes from the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activity, MedDRA) indicating
different types of drug-induced liver injury: ‘hepatocellular injury’ and ‘cholestatic injury’.
Supplemental Table 1 summarizes the lists of ‘Preferred terms’ used to define the two
custom terms (26 terms for ‘hepatocellular injury’ and 16 terms for ‘cholestatic injury’).
2.6. Analytical methods

Author Manuscript

The data were computed using the Empirica™ Signal application (Oracle, Waltham, MA,
USA). A relative reporting ratio (RRR) was defined as the observed count divided by the
expected count. Empirical Bayes Geometric Mean (EBGM) is defined as the exponential
value of log (RRR) under the posterior probability distributions for each true RRR. The
lower and upper 90% confidence limits (EB05, EB95) for the RRR were derived from the
posterior probability distribution (Fig. 1). Identification of a drug–drug interaction was
performed in two ways: based on 90% confidence interval (CI) of EBGM (DuMouchel,
1999, 2001; Hauben, 2003; Almenoff et al., 2005) (unadjusted) and interaction statistics of
logistic regression (INT_TOT) (DuMouchel, 2007) (adjusted), described below. Due to the
exploratory nature of the analyses, alpha levels were not adjusted for multiple comparisons.

2.6.1. Identification of significant drug–drug interaction—First, EBGM 3dimensional (3D) analyses were performed to identify drugs and drug classes which were
significantly associated with changes in reporting frequency of the 4 primary study drugs:
acetaminophen, isoniazid, valproic acid, and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (i.e., drug–drug
interaction). Drug–drug interactions were initially explored using individual drugs (generic
names). Then this same analysis was repeated using drug classes (ATC4 category) to
strengthen its biological relevance and to better detect a 3D interaction. We computed the
reporting frequency of liver events as EBGM with 2-sided 90% CI using the MGPS (MultiItem Gamma Poisson Shrinker) method (DuMouchel, 1999, 2001; Hauben, 2003; Almenoff
et al., 2005). EBGM data were computed for all the following pairs/combinations using the
specified custom liver event terms: (1) drug (or drug class) and liver event (i.e., 2D EBGM)
and (2) a pair of drugs (or drug classes) and liver event (i.e., 3D EBGM) (Fig. 1a and b).
Reflecting the predominant type of injury, the EBGM analyses applied the hepatocellular
injury term for acetaminophen, isoniazid, and valproic acid, and the cholestatic term for
amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (Chalasani et al., 2014). A significant 3D interaction was
identified by comparing 90% CIs of 2D and 3D EBGM using interaction signal score
[INTSS] (Almenoff et al., 2003). Fig. 1C outlines detailed methods.

We performed logistic regression analyses to re-assess the identified drug–drug interaction
after adjusting for the effects of other drug classes, age, and gender and estimated the
adjusted effects of the drug classes on the liver event reporting frequency of the 4 primary
study drugs. Drug classes were considered in the logistic regression analyses when the
above EBGM 3-dimensional (3D) analyses were identified to be: (1) associated with
decreasing reporting frequency of more than one primary study drug, (2) associated with
increasing reporting frequency in more than one primary drug associated with hepatocellular
liver injury (i.e., acetaminophen, isoniazid, valproic acid), or 3) associated with increasing
reporting frequency in the primary drug associated with cholestatic liver injury (i.e.,
amoxicillin/clavulanic acid). Interaction statistics [INT_TOT with 90% CI] identified
significant drug–drug interaction in the logistic regression models (DuMouchel, 2007). The
interaction statistics were defined as a product of both: (1) the predicted ratio of the
probability of liver events in the models (i.e. the probability given both the drug classes
divided by the probability given one of the drug classes associated with the worst
probability) and (2) corrective statistics based on the ratio of observed numbers of 3D cases
to predicted numbers of 3D cases using the model without an interaction term, which would
adjust for sampling variability and lack of fit to the models (i.e., Empirical Bayes shrinkage
estimate of additional interaction) (DuMouchel, 2007); 90% CIs of the calculated interaction
statistics were compared with 1. We classified the drug class as associated with a significant
decrease in the liver event reporting frequency co-reported with the primary study drug
when the upper limit of the 90% CI was less than 1. The drug class was classified as
associated with a significant increase in the liver event reporting frequency when the lower
limit of the 90% CI was greater than 1.

Liver event reporting frequency was analyzed by data mining for the 4 primary study drugs:
acetaminophen, isoniazid, valproic acid, and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid. For each of the 4
drugs, total numbers were summarized for: liver event reports, EBGM data with 90% CI, comedications co-reported, and identified drugs (Table 1). There were ample numbers of liver
events for each of the 4 drugs and the various comedications in the database to provide
sufficient power for this data-mining analysis: 8215 liver events and 2037 co-medications
for acetaminophen, 3302 liver events and 665 co-medications for isoniazid, 3532 liver
events and 926 co-medications for valproic acid, and 2804 liver events and 945 comedications for amoxicillin/clavulanic acid. Overall, potential effects of 2275 comedications were analyzed. Among these co-medications, liver event reporting frequency
was decreased by 245 drugs and increased by 170 drugs in at least one of the 4 primary
study drugs (Supplemental Table 2a and b). Folic acid and tramadol were associated with
decreased reporting frequency for all the 4 study drugs. Reporting frequency for 3 of the 4
study drugs was decreased in association with bupropion, acetylsalicylic acid, warfarin,
furosemide, nifedipine, metoprolol, clozapine, levothyroxine, as well as sulfamethoxazole
and trimethoprim. Carbamazepine was associated with increased reporting frequency for all
3 study drugs causing predominantly hepatocellular injury. We then examined the identified
drugs by drug classes. Liver event reporting frequency was lower when the primary study
drug was co-reported with the following drug classes, including: Tumor Necrosis Factor
alpha (TNF-α) inhibitors, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, alphaadrenoreceptor antagonists, mucolytics, monoclonal antibodies (i.e., anti-neoplastic
treatment), and histamine-2 (H2)-receptor antagonists. Liver event reporting frequency was
higher when the primary study drug was co-reported with several drug classes:
sympathomimetics (centrally acting), adrenergic and dopaminergic agents, interferons,
macrolides, diphenylpropylamine derivatives, and halogenated hydrocarbons (e.g.
anesthetics). Drug classes were listed here only when ≥3 drugs were identified within each
category.
3.2. Exploratory data mining analysis using drug classes

Author Manuscript

We next performed data mining analysis using drug classes (i.e., ATC4 categories),
examining drug classes co-reported in the primary study drug liver events, to support the
biological relevance and enhance the detection of a 3D interaction. Table 2 summarizes the
316 drug classes analyzed (i.e., co-reported with liver events and the 4 study drugs); 122
drug classes of comedications were associated with decreasing reporting frequency, while
82 drug classes were associated with increasing reporting frequency for at least one of the 4
study drugs. Among the 122 drug classes associated with decreased liver event reporting
frequency, 15 classes (12.3%) had decreased reporting frequency in all 4 primary drugs and
91 classes (74.6%) were drug-specific. In the 82 drug classes with increased liver event
reporting frequency, only 3 (3.7%) had higher reporting frequency in all 4 primary drugs,
while 73 (89.0%) were drug-specific. Overall, 47 drug classes were associated with a
decreasing or increasing liver event reporting frequency for multiple primary study drugs
(Table 3).

The 47 drug classes associated with liver event reporting of more than 1 of the 4 primary
drugs were further examined. Logistic regression analysis was performed including age,
gender, and the 47 drug classes. After adjusting for these other factors, four drug classes
exhibited lower liver event reporting frequency when co-reported with all 4 primary drugs:
folic acid, natural opium alkaloids, other opioids and TNF-α inhibitors (Table 3). Several
other drug classes were associated with decreased reporting frequency for individual
primary drugs. Three drug classes exhibited an increased liver event reporting frequency
when co-reported with 3 of 4 primary drugs (after adjustment): halogenated hydrocarbons
(e.g. anesthetics), bile acid sequestrants, and carboxamide derivatives (e.g. antiepileptics and
antineoplastic alkylating agents). An additional 14 drug classes showed an increased
reporting frequency for at least one study drug. Overall, proton pump inhibitors were the
only drug class which exhibited different liver event reporting frequency effects for the 4
primary drugs (after adjustment), with decreased reporting for the drugs associated with
hepatocellular injury and increased reporting frequency for amoxicillin/clavulanic acid,
associated with cholestatic injury.

4. Discussion

Author Manuscript

Using the global safety database, VigiBase™, data-mining analyses examined how
comedications might affect the liver event reporting frequency of 4 drugs highly associated
with different forms of hepatotoxicity: acetaminophen, isoniazid, valproic acid, and
amoxicillin/clavulanic acid. Using quantitative signal detection methods, we first identified
liver event reports for the 4 primary drugs and then examined the comedications. We then
used data mining to uncover potential drug–drug interactions using frequency data. Drugs
and drug classes were identified which significantly decreased or increased liver event
reporting frequency when co-reported with the 4 primary drugs. Many drugs and drug
classes, when co-reported with these 4 primary drugs, were associated with changes in liver
event reporting frequency and clinical outcomes. For example, decreased liver event
reporting frequency for all 4 primary drugs was observed when folic acid, TNF-α inhibitors,
or opioids were co-reported, suggesting a potential beneficial effect. Decreased liver event
reporting frequency was observed for numerous drug classes co-reported with more than one
primary study drug associated with hepatotoxicity. Additionally, some drug classes were
associated with an increased liver event reporting frequency in a drug specific or nonspecific
manner. Based on these findings, we generated hypotheses to explain the mechanisms for
the effects of these targeted comedications on drug-induced liver injury.

Author Manuscript

This developed conceptual framework explains the mechanisms of drug-induced liver injury
and the effects of comedications which appeared to ameliorate or exacerbate injury (Figs. 2
and 3). Recent data suggest that liver injury is initiated by a distinct subset of drugs
administered at a high daily dose (Lammert et al., 2008; Yu et al., 2014), and lipophilicity
(Chen et al., 2014), which may form reactive metabolites (Sakatis et al., 2012), inhibit bile
salt export pump (BSEP) or other transporters (Morgan et al., 2013; Aleo et al., 2014),
impair mitochondria (Pessayre et al., 2012; Han et al., 2013), alter histone acetylation
(Kacevska et al., 2011), and injure biliary epithelium (Cullen et al., 2010). By describing the
mechanisms activated by specific medications, one can postulate how comedications impact
the initiation or adaptation/resolution of drug-induced liver injury (Pessayre et al., 2012).

Suzuki et al.

Author Manuscript

However, some drugs and drug classes impact liver event reporting frequency for all 4
primary study drugs (even after adjusting for other co-medications), suggesting a more
generalized effect. So, perhaps comedications affect the later common phases of druginduced liver injury, including: cytoprotection, stress response (Han et al., 2013), regulation
of injury and/or immune response (Han et al., 2013; Uetrecht and Naisbitt, 2013), and tissue
repair. Comedications can favorably modulate the immune system (e.g., TNF-α inhibitors,
glucocorticoids, opioids), liver injury/repair (e.g., ACE inhibitors/angiotensin II blockers)
(Alisi et al., 2005; Suzuki et al., 2009a,b), and oxidative stress (e.g., folic acid, thyroid
hormone) (Huang et al., 2001; Romanque et al., 2011), and thereby decrease liver injury.
Other drugs and drug classes may reduce inflammation (e.g., coxibs, aspirin, anti-vitamin K)
or protect cells from cellular injury: estrogens (Shimizu and Ito, 2007; Kozlov et al., 2010),
mucolytics (Felix et al., 1996), and benzodiazepines (Carayon et al., 1996; Kunduzova et al.,
2004).

In contrast, some comedications appear to enhance liver injury. This could be explained by a
comedication enhancing metabolism to a toxic metabolite or reducing detoxification
mechanisms, which are well known to enhance hepatotoxicity of classic hepatotoxins like
acetaminophen (Zimmerman, 1999). As carbamazepine induces several cytochrome P450s,
it could enhance hepatotoxicity through this mechanism. Other compounds, including
sympathetic stimulants, deplete glutathione (James et al., 1993) and inhibit liver repair
mechanisms (Oben et al., 2003) thus increasing susceptibility. Carboxamides, pyrazinamide,
and isoniazid are also known to induce epigenetic modifications (i.e., hypo-methylation
and/or histone acetylation); decreased histone acetylation with isoniazid administration
impairs liver regeneration after injury (Poirier and Wise, 2003; Murata et al., 2007). The use
of proton pump inhibitors decreased reporting of the drugs associated with hepatocellular
injury, while increasing the reporting frequency of amoxicillin/- clavulanic acid associated
with cholestatic injury, postulated due to enhanced allergenicity as proton pump inhibitors
increase gastric pH (Ramirez et al., 2013). These findings align with an earlier analysis of
fatal acetaminophen-associated liver injury, in which comedications that exacerbate injury
or reduce repair increased injury while those that reduce injury or enhance repair were
protective (Suzuki et al., 2009a,b).

Author Manuscript

In addition to the effect of comedications on hepatocellular injury, the effect of
comedications on cholestatic injury was examined for amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (Fig. 3).
Hepatocytes tightly regulate the quantity of intracellular bile acids through balancing bile
acid influx, synthesis, and excretion. Cholestatic injury can result from a reduction in bile
acid excretion (e.g., macrolide-associated BSEP inhibition (Stieger et al., 2000; Morgan et
al., 2010), increased bile acid synthesis, and/or increased sinusoidal bile acid transport (e.g.,
cholestyramine (Jolley et al., 2000; Cheng et al., 2007). Additional mechanisms may
contribute to cholestatic drug-induced liver injury, including: alteration of bile composition,
biliary water flow, and vascular injury (Fig. 3).
Based on the rationale provided above, it is plausible that co-medications that modulate
immune response, drug metabolism, cytoprotection, adaptation, injury, cholestasis, and
repair may modify susceptibility to a wide range of drugs associated with hepatotoxicity
(Fig. 2). Related to these mechanisms, genetic or acquired risk factors could similarly be

generalizable among different drugs. With hepatotoxicants sensitizing hepatocytes to TNFalpha, the innate and adaptive immune response critically determine the course of druginduced liver injury (Han et al., 2013). For example, compared to rats receiving the
hepatotoxicant amiodarone or nonlethal lipopolysaccharide (LPS) alone, both TNF-alpha
concentration and liver injury were increased with the coadministration of LPS and
amiodarone (Lu et al., 2012). When the TNF-alpha inhibitor, etanercept, was administered
one hour prior to the LPS and amiodarone, liver injury significantly decreased (Lu et al.,
2012). In the current analysis, TNF-alpha inhibitor coadministration decreased liver event
reporting for all four clinical hepatotoxicants; this suggests the importance of TNF-alpha in
clinical drug-induced liver injury and the translational relevance of the nonclinical models
(Lu et al., 2012). These theories can be systematically evaluated in a well-characterized
drug-induced liver injury cohort, linked to genetic information, or a large electronic medical
record system to assess clinical and disease association (Kohane, 2011).

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Using electronic medical records, a retrospective UK population study reported a 6-fold
increased risk of drug-induced liver injury with coadministration of two or more drugs
associated with hepatotoxicity, in comparison to single drug use (de Abajo et al., 2004).
Similarly, a systematic review reported an increased risk of severe or fatal hepatotoxicity
when amoxicillin: clavulanate is coadministered with drugs associated with hepatotoxicity,
including antimicrobials, analgesics and hormonal therapy (Yazici et al., 2014). Examining
clinical factors and preclinical mechanisms, most (67%) drugs withdrawn from the market
or displaying black box warnings for drug-induced liver injury exhibit inhibition of both
liver mitochondrial and bile salt export pump function (Aleo et al., 2014). Aside from these
studies, there are very limited data on the effect of comedications on drug-induced liver
injury, due to the low frequency of drug-induced liver injury (requiring very large databases)
and the detailed clinical information required to accurately evaluate events. However, there
is a compelling clinical need to understand how medications or supplements may affect
clinical outcomes and influence susceptibility to specific drugs. For example, numerous
chemotherapy agents result in hepatotoxicity (McWhirter et al., 2013); addition of a
carboxamide (e.g. dacarbazine) could potentially further increase injury or result in the
interruption or termination of otherwise effective therapy.

Author Manuscript

We present a mechanism-based approach to examine how comedications can modulate the
liver safety of 4 drugs commonly associated with hepatotoxicity. Our search for published
drug: drug interactions related to the 4 study drugs in the publicly available resources
revealed metabolic interactions for acetaminophen and isoniazid, as well as isoniazid or
valproic acid and carbamazepine, which could increase hepatotoxicity. However, the large
majority of drug pairs identified by data mining were not predicted by published drug: drug
interactions. Using this unbiased (as opposed to hypothesis-driven) approach to evaluate
comedications in a global database, we analyzed all relevant drug pairs, as liver injury
mechanisms are incompletely understood.
The use of spontaneously reported safety data in pharmacovigilance is limited by reporting

2005). Furthermore, incomplete case data frequently preclude adjudication of drug-induced
liver injury reports, as well as the reliable identification of acute liver failure. We applied
logistic regression models to adjust for potential confounding effects by co-reported drugs;
however, numerous other factors, not evaluated in this study, may also influence reporting
frequency (e.g. country-specific mandatory reporting, etc.). Interpretation of
pharmacovigilance data requires a thoughtful and comprehensive assessment of disease
mechanisms, clinical pharmacology, clinical science, and potential biases. Data mining is
particularly useful for generating hypotheses, which must be further examined in electronic
medical records, drug-induced liver injury (or acute liver failure) registries (Suzuki et al.,
2009a,b), clinical trials or through preclinical mechanistic investigations. Such an approach
has recently identified a pravastatin:paroxetine pharmacodynamic interaction in the Food
and Drug Administration (FDA) Adverse Event Reporting System (Tatonetti et al., 2011).

In addition to using spontaneously reported safety data, this study has several other
limitations. The analysis deliberately overlooked drug–drug interactions caused by drugspecific properties, due to its focus on the class effect of drugs. For example, increased liver
event reporting was an anticipated drug:drug interaction with coadministration of
carboxamides or barbiturates (CYP2C9 inducers) with valproic acid (a CYP2C9 substrate)
(Indiana University, 2015). However, reported drug:drug interactions were otherwise
uncommon among the comedications significantly altering liver event reporting frequency
of the four hepatotoxicants (Law et al., 2014; Indiana University, 2015). In addition, the
analysis did not evaluate the effect of drug–dose, –age or –gender interactions on effect of
comedications, although these have previously been reported (Suzuki et al., 2009a,b). As
underlying disease can modify the impact of comedications or susceptibility to liver injury,
this should be investigated in future studies. Lastly, the analysis may not have effectively
identified the impact of herbal medicines or dietary supplements, as the chemical and
biological properties of these agents are not well characterized, despite being increasingly
recognized in drug-induced liver injury and acute liver failure cases (Estes et al., 2003;
Takikawa et al., 2009; Reuben et al., 2010). The potential impact of these agents merits
future investigation.

Despite its limitations, our approach is valuable in investigating the impact of comedications
on specific drug-induced liver injury events. The global VigiBase™ includes millions of
adverse drug reports for over-the-counter drugs, dietary supplements, and herbal medicines,
in addition to prescription drugs. So, this database provides a valuable resource for
exploratory analyses on the impact of comedications and theory generation. Additionally,
comedications may alter susceptibility to injury by diverse mechanisms: altering drug
absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion; modulating cell biology, stress response,
and regeneration; and influencing neural, endocrine, and immune systems. Thus, assessing
the impact of comedications on epidemiological endpoints (e.g., frequency, clinical
outcomes) has the great advantage of examining diverse mechanisms in a holistic manner. In
summary, this is the first study to systematically investigate the effect of comedications on
liver injury events co-reported with 4 drugs commonly associated with hepatotoxicity
(acetaminophen, isoniazid, valproic acid, and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid) by applying
quantitative signal detection methods to a global safety reporting system. We constructed a
holistic, evidence-based conceptual framework to explain how the identified drugs and drug

classes might influence liver events using established mechanisms of liver injury and
adaptation/repair. Due to the limitations of pharmacovigilance data, these findings are
preliminary. Yet, we believe our results and theories have broad implications for future
drug-induced liver injury research, and provide a foundation to investigate drug–drug
interactions in electronic medical records or large clinical databases containing wellcharacterized drug-induced liver injury cases, as well as in nonclinical experimental models.
The specific theories developed in this framework are being independently validated
currently. These efforts will enhance patient safety, yield preventive strategies to avoid
deleterious drug combinations and promote interdisciplinary research to delineate clinical
mechanisms of drug-induced liver injury. Once the approach has been verified and
validated, it may be applied to other key toxicities (such as cardiovascular, renal, and
dermatologic adverse drug events) as a valuable tool to investigate drug safety in the setting
of polypharmacy.

(a) Calculation of relative reporting ratio for a drug and a liver event and two-dimensional
(2D) empirical Bayes geometric mean of relative reporting ratio (2D EBGM): Relative
reporting ratio (RRR) was calculated as the ratio of reporting frequency of a liver event
among cases co-reported with Drug A [a/(a + b)] to reporting frequency of a liver event
among cases co-reported with other drugs [c/(c + d)]. The RRR, a(c + d)/c(a + b), was then
transformed to empirical Bayes geometric mean of relative reporting ratio with 90%
confidence interval (CI) while adjusting for sampling variability. (b) Calculation of relative
reporting ratio for a pair of drugs and a liver event and three-dimensional (3D) Empirical
Bayes Geometric Mean of relative reporting ratio (3D EBGM): The same calculation was
applied to pairs of drugs. RRR was calculated as the ratio of reporting frequency of a liver
event among cases co-reported with Drug A and Drug B [a/(a + b)] over reporting frequency
of a liver event among cases co-reported with other pairs [c/(c + d)]. The RRR, a(c + d)/c(a
+ b), was then transformed to empirical Bayes geometric mean of relative reporting ratio
with 90% CI. (c) Identification of 3D interaction: To identify drugs significantly increasing
reporting frequency of liver events, we compared the EB95 of 2D EBGM and the EB05 of
3D EBGM. When the ratio of EB05 to a larger EB95 (i.e., interaction signal score or
INTSS) was greater than 1, we considered Drug A significantly increased reporting
frequency of liver events co-reported with the drug associated with hepatotoxicity (HTx). To

significantly decreased reporting frequency of liver events co-reported with the drug

Theoretical framework explaining cholestatic features of drug-induced liver injury and the
impact of comedications. We theorize that cholestatic features of drug-induced liver injury
[i.e., intrahepatocellular cholestasis, canalicular cholestasis, intralobular cholestasis, bile
duct injury] are explained by the four depicted mechanisms: intrahepatocellular bile acid
accumulation, alteration of bile acid compositions, bile water flow, and vascular injury. In
hepatocytes, the quantity of bile acids is tightly regulated by a balance of bile acid influx,
synthesis, and excretion. When bile acid excretion is reduced [e.g., via BSEP inhibition]
(Stieger et al., 2000; Morgan et al., 2010)], the hepatocellular bile acid accumulation
resulting from increased bile acid synthesis and/or increased sinusoidal bile acid transport
could exacerbate hepatocellular damage (Perez and Briz, 2009) and intrahepatocellular
cholestasis [e.g., cholestyramine] (Jolley et al., 2000; Cheng et al., 2007). Under
physiological conditions, cholangiocytes are protected from the detergent effects of bile
acids by forming mixed micelles mainly composed of bile acids, phosphatidylcholine and
cholesterol (Davit-Spraul et al., 2010). Reduced excretion of phosphatidylcholine into bile
(Davit-Spraul et al., 2010) and/or decreasing bicarbonate concentration [e.g., lowering pH]
in bile could disturb this micelle formation and/or facilitate cholesterol crystallization,
resulting in bile duct injury and obstruction. Although there is limited direct evidence on
how diuretics impact susceptibility to drug-induced cholestatic injury, prior clinical studies

report diuretic use associated with cholelithiasis (Randall et al., 1992; Leitzmann et al.,
2005) and a preclinical study (Hubner et al., 2000) provide indirect support that specific
diuretics could alter biliary electrolytes and pH, leading to micelle perturbation and
cholesterol crystallization. Bile contains more than 95% water. Although the
pathophysiological significance of bile water flow is yet unclear, reduced bile water flow,
either passive or active, may contribute to bile stagnation and cholestatic drug-induced liver
injury. With decreased bile flow and bile acid secretion, a moderate aging-related decline in
biliary function could also predispose to cholestatic features of drug-induced liver injury.

Theoretical framework explaining clinical drug-induced liver injury and the impact of
comedications. As depicted, liver injury can be initiated by various mechanisms. Once
initiated, the severity and clinical outcome of drug-induced liver injury is affected by the
individual’s response. We theorize that such responses are largely determined by host
immune response and the balance between injury/inflammation and repair. Our study
identified numerous drugs/drug classes which are known to modulate immune response and
inflammation. Such drugs/drug classes include anti-TNFα, glucocorticoids, opioids (Roy
and Loh, 1996; Peterson et al., 1998), anti-histamines (Okamoto et al., 2009), antimuscarinic (Vacca et al., 2011), SSRIs (Maes, 2001), and beta2-adrenoreceptor agonists
(Wang et al., 2009). Other drugs/drug classes are known to reduce inflammation [e.g.,
coxibs, aspirin, anti-vitamin K, TNF-alpha inhibitors, glucocorticoids] or protect cells from
cellular injury [e.g., folic acids] (Huang et al., 2001), thyroid hormones (Romanque et al.,
2011), estrogens (Shimizu and Ito, 2007; Kozlov et al., 2010), mucolytics (Felix et al.,
1996), and benzodiazepines (Carayon et al., 1996; Kunduzova et al., 2004). Several drugs/
drug classes may exert their impact via modulating repair [e.g., ACE-inhibitors, angiotensin
II blockers, calcium blockers, antiadrenergics, thyroid hormones] (Garcia-Pagan et al., 1994;
Alisi et al., 2005; Suzuki et al., 2009a,b) or epigenetic modification [i.e., hypo-methylation
and/or histone acetylation, e.g., carboxamides, hydantoin, barbiturates, pyrazinamide, and
isoniazid] (Poirier and Wise, 2003; Murata et al., 2007).
