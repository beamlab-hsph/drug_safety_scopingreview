Abstract
Introduction Missing age presents a significant challenge when evaluating individual case safety reports (ICSRs) in the
FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS). When age is missing in an ICSR’s structured field, it may be in the report’s
free-text narrative.
Objectives This study aimed to evaluate the performance and assess the potential impact of a rule-based natural language
processing (NLP) tool that utilizes a text string search to identify patients’ numerical age from unstructured narratives.
Methods Using FAERS ICSRs from 2002 to 2018, we evaluated the annual proportion of ICSRs with age missing in the
structured field before and after NLP application. Reviewers manually identified patients’ age from ICSR narratives (gold
standard) from a random sample of 1500 ICSRs. The gold standard was compared to the NLP-identified age.
Results During the study period, the percentage of ICSRs missing age in the structured field increased from 21.9 to 43.8%.
The NLP tool performed well among the random sample: sensitivity 98.5%, specificity 92.9%, positive predictive value
(PPV) 94.9%, and F-measure 96.7%. It also performed well for the subset of ICSRs missing age in the structured field; when
applied to these cases, NLP identified age for an additional one million ICSRs (10% of the total number of ICSRs from 2002
to 2018) and decreased the percentage of ICSRs missing age to 27% overall.
Conclusions NLP has potential utility to extract patients’ age from ICSR narratives. Use of this tool would enhance pharmacovigilance and research using FAERS data.

Key Points
Missing age in the structured field of post-marketing
individual case safety reports (ICSRs) presents a significant challenge for case assessment during safety surveillance.

1 Introduction
The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Adverse
Event Reporting System (FAERS) is a database designed
to support FDA’s post-marketing safety surveillance program for drug and therapeutic biological products [1].
The FAERS database contains spontaneous individual
case safety reports (ICSRs) of adverse events (AEs) and
medication errors submitted by healthcare professionals,
consumers, and manufacturers.
FDA conducts ongoing surveillance of FAERS for all
marketed products. Evaluation of ICSRs includes consideration for the product, event, and patient factors. One crucial patient factor is age, as it provides physiologic, pharmacologic, and epidemiologic context for surveillance. For
example, pediatric patients are more susceptible to adverse
drug reactions; robust pediatric data for therapies are often
lacking, and many products are used off-label [2, 3].
Despite being an elemental demographic, age is frequently missing in an ICSR’s structured field [4–6]. However, the narrative of an ICSR allows reporters to provide
information in free-form text format, which may include
information not captured in structured fields. Currently,
FDA reviewers manually review the narratives or use
other customized workarounds (e.g., narrative text string
searches) to determine if a patient’s age is reported in the
narrative when missing from the structured field. Beyond
ICSR evaluation, missing age information also has implications on accurate retrieval of relevant cases for review
that are dependent on the structured age field and on signal detection algorithms that incorporate age information
[7]. These implications are especially important for the
identification of cases relevant to pediatric-focused postmarketing safety reviews, including those mandated by US
legislation in 2002 [8, 9].
Natural language processing (NLP) has been widely
used to facilitate drug safety activities with various data
sources including electronic health records, internet-based
data such as social media, published medical literature,
and spontaneous reporting systems [10, 11]. Wunnava
et al. [12] developed and evaluated rule-based and machine
learning-based extraction methods using NLP to extract
patient demographics, drug, and AE information from
unstructured narratives of 60 ICSRs from the FAERS database. Their analyses suggest that the rule-based extraction
method using raw text strings performed better than the
supervised machine learning-based extraction methods or
rules based on grammar or part-of-speech for demographic
information in FAERS. Based on the demonstrated performance of the rule-based extraction method, a simple NLP
algorithm described by Wunnava et al. to extract patient
age, we expanded on their findings to validate this tool

using a larger gold standard dataset of ICSRs in FAERS.
Furthermore, we evaluated the extent to which NLP can
improve the identification of patient age from ICSRs in the
FAERS database from 2002 to 2018.

2 Methods
2.1 Data Source
The FAERS database contains more than 21 million ICSRs
from 1968 to 2020. Manufacturers submit postmarketing
ICSRs as expedited (within 15 days) if the ICSRs contain
an AE that is not described in the product labeling and led
to a serious outcome; otherwise, the ICSRs are submitted as
non-expedited [13]. ICSRs that are voluntarily submitted to
the FDA by healthcare professionals or consumers through
the MedWatch program are referred to as direct reports [14].
The FAERS structure adheres to the international safety
reporting guidance issued by the International Conference
on Harmonisation (ICH) [15]. ICSRs contain many data elements for patient characteristics, reaction or event, product,
and reporter; structured data are encouraged for electronic
submissions [16]. Some data elements, such as case narratives, are unstructured fields in the form of free-text; additionally, submission of ICSRs allows for attachments such
as medical records, images, and published literature. FDA
guidance on data element transmission of ICSRs allows
senders to use different ways of including the same data
without being redundant to cope with differing information
contents (e.g., age information can be sent as date of birth
and date of reaction or event, age at the time of reaction or
event, or patient age group according to the available information) [16]. The structured age field is populated by the
age provided by the reporter or if missing, a calculated age
is populated in FAERS if both the patient’s date of birth and
event date are available.

2.2 Descriptive Analyses
We identified all ICSRs initially received by the FDA from
January 1, 2002, to December 31, 2018. The latest ICSR
version was used as the representative report if follow-up
information was received from the same reporter. We calculated the overall and annual proportion of ICSRs missing an age in the structured field by report type (i.e., expedited, non-expedited, or direct). ICSRs were then stratified
by those with and without an age in the structured field
for comparison of the following report characteristics:
report type, reporter type (e.g., healthcare provider, consumer), reporter country, and reported outcomes. Serious
outcomes are defined by US regulations and include one or

Enhancing Patient Age Ascertainment from Adverse Event Reports

more of the following: death, hospitalization, life-threatening, disability, congenital anomaly, and other serious
outcomes [13].

2.3 Sample Selection and Gold Standard
Ascertainment
A random sample of 1500 ICSRs from all ICSRs received
during the study period was selected for reviewers to manually identify patients’ age from the ICSR narratives. The
size of the random sample was first determined by the
considerations of statistical power calculation and then
slightly increased given the reasonably easy process of
manual review. Assuming the positive predictive value
(PPV) is 0.90, a sample size of 1500 provides more than
90% power to rule out a lower bound of 95% confidence
interval (CI) of PPV lower than 85%.
The gold standard for the NLP validation process was
the manually-extracted patient’s age (in years) at the time
of the first AE (if multiple AEs were reported) or the
patient’s age at the time of reporting (if the age at event
onset was not reported). If the patient’s age in the narrative was reported in days or months, reviewers converted
the age to years (values were rounded to the tenth digit
to match the rounding performed by the NLP algorithm).
Patient’s age reported as an age range, approximate age,
or not reported in the narrative were assigned as null age.
Two reviewers independently reviewed each ICSR narrative to identify age. If there was a disagreement, a third
reviewer adjudicated. Some ICSRs in the dataset may contain age in the structured field, but reviewers were blinded
to this value. Age from the structured field was not taken
into consideration during the determination of the gold
standard or validation phase of the study.

2.4 NLP Algorithm
The NLP algorithm uses rule-based text mining to extract
age from the unstructured narrative field of the ICSRs and
outputs the age in years. The algorithm searches the text in
each ICSR’s narrative field and extracts the first instance
of the numerical value preceding variations of the text
strings reflecting “years” or “years old.” If there are no
year terms in the text, then the algorithm extracts the first
instance of the numerical value preceding variations of the
text strings for “months” or “months old” and converts the
value to age in years (rounded to the nearest tenth digit). If
no terms are extracted for age, then the algorithm outputs
null age. The regular expression code used to implement
the algorithm is provided in Supplementary Materials
Table 1.

2.5 NLP Validation
To evaluate the performance of the NLP tool, we compared
the values from the NLP output with the gold standard for
an exact match (Table 1). The two primary metrics used to
evaluate information retrieval are PPV (precision) and sensitivity (recall). Sensitivity is the probability that a relevant
value is retrieved by the tool. PPV is the probability that a
retrieved value is relevant (i.e., matches the gold standard).
The two metrics are often combined into a single measure
called “F-measure,” which allows researchers to weigh
either PPV or sensitivity more heavily [17]. In our study,
PPV and sensitivity were equally important, and F-measure
was calculated as:

F=

2 × PPV × sensitivity
× 100
PPV + sensitivity

Validity was also measured by specificity, the probability
that a non-relevant value is not retrieved by the tool. The
percentage of overall matching was calculated as:

True positive + true negative
× 100
sum of all reports
For each of these metrics, the 95% CI was calculated
using the binomial “exact” method. In our post hoc analysis,
we further assessed the performance of the NLP tool among
the ICSRs with age missing and with age available in the
structured field, respectively.
To analyze the NLP errors, we reviewed the ICSR narratives to categorize the reason for the mismatch.

2.6 NLP Application
We applied the NLP tool to all ICSRs received during the
study period. The patient age for each ICSR was then determined using a combined approach considering the structured
age field and NLP extracted age. If age was missing in the
structured field, the NLP extracted age was considered the
patient age. If the structured age field and NLP extracted
age were null, then age was considered missing. Using this
combined approach, we determined the proportion of ICSRs
annually and overall missing an age. Additionally, ICSRs
were tabulated by age group using the structured age field
alone versus the combined approach (i.e., structured age
field + NLP output). Percentage change between the groups
was calculated as:
Number of reports after NLP − number of reports before NLP
× 100
number of reports before NLP

3 Results
3.1 Characterization of ICSRs
Of 10,300,594 ICSRs received in the study period, the overall percentage of reports with missing age in the structured
field was 37.2%. The annual proportion of ICSRs missing
age increased over time, from 21.9% in 2002 to 43.8% in
2018 (Fig. 1). Direct reports had the lowest overall proportion of ICSRs missing age (12%), followed by expedited and
non-expedited ICSRs (31.5% and 46.6%, respectively). An

3.2 Gold Standard Ascertainment
The distribution of ICSRs by year and report type for the random sample of 1500 ICSRs was similar between the study
sample and all ICSRs received (Supplementary Materials
Figs. 1, 2), which indicated the sample was representative
of the total ICSRs. In the random sample, 38% (570/1500)
of the ICSRs were missing age in the structured field. After
manual review of the 1500 ICSR narratives, we identified a
numerical age from the narratives as the gold standard for
868 ICSRs (57.9%). The reviewers determined null age to
be the gold standard for the remaining 632 ICSRs (42.1%);
note that for ICSRs without age identified in the narrative,
age may be available in the structured field.

3.3 NLP Validation
Among the 1500 ICSRs in our random sample, the NLP tool
extracted an age for 894 ICSRs: 849 were true positives and

increased trend in percent of ICSRs with missing age was
observed for expedited and non-expedited ICSRs; however,
no clear trend was observed for direct reports.
Characteristics of ICSRs with and without age in the
structured field are described in Table 2. Approximately
half of all ICSRs were reported by healthcare professionals,
among which 68.1% provided an age in the structured field.
Reports originating outside of the USA contained age more
often than those originating in the USA (73.7% vs 58.8%).
Of the serious outcomes reported, congenital anomalies had
the lowest proportion (35.6%) and life-threatening had the
highest proportion (87.2%) of ICSRs with age.

45 were false positives. Among the 606 ICSRs without an
age extracted from the narrative, 593 were true negatives and
13 were false negatives. The NLP tool achieved high performance with sensitivity of 98.5% (95% CI 97.4–99.2%),
PPV of 94.9% (95% CI 93.3–96.3%), F-measure of 96.7%
(95% CI 95.3–97.7%), and specificity of 93.0% (95% CI
90.7–94.8%). Overall, 96.1% (95% CI 95.0–97.0%) of the
ICSRs had a match between the NLP output and the gold
standard dataset.
Our qualitative error analysis identified several categories of false positive and negative errors. Table 3 provides
the frequencies of error categories and examples. The
absence of a year or month unit was the most frequent
reason for false negative errors (30.7%). This occurred
because reviewers were able to determine age from the
narrative’s context despite the absence of terms analogous
to “years” or “months.” Other causes of false negatives
were typographical errors, missed extractions of numbers
at the beginning of a paragraph, non-numerical ages, and
age unit of weeks and days. Missed extractions at a paragraph’s start occurred because the tool required a space to
be present before a numerical value. The most common
cause of false positive errors was when NLP extracted
a value that was a unit of time that was not age-related

(60%). Often, these ICSRs described a length of time for
the use of a medication or was related to information from
the patient’s medical history. The second most common
cause of false positive errors included non-patient-specific ages extracted by NLP; examples included literature
reports that described age characteristics of patients in
clinical trials, observational studies, or case series.
Among the 1500 ICSRs in our random sample, there
were 930 ICSRs with age available in the structured field
and 570 ICSRs with age missing in the structured field
(Supplementary Materials Tables 2 and 3). In the post hoc
analysis, we evaluated the performance of the NLP tool
among the subset of ICSRs with age missing and with
age available in the structured field. The sensitivity and
specificity of the NLP tool for the reports with age missing in the structured field were 98.5% and 93.3%, respectively, whereas for the reports with age in the structured
field, sensitivity and specificity were 98.5% and 92.2%,
respectively. However, the PPV and F-measure were lower
for the reports with age missing in the structured field
(82.3% and 89.7%, respectively), compared to those for
the reports with age in the structured field (97.8% and
98.3%, respectively). Among the reports with age missing
in the structured field, only 24% had age in the narratives.

Enhancing Patient Age Ascertainment from Adverse Event Reports

In contrast, 78% of the reports with age in the structured
field had age in the narratives.

3.4 NLP Application
Among the 3.8 million ICSRs missing age in the structured field, the NLP tool identified age for an additional one
million ICSRs. Resultingly, the overall number of ICSRs
missing age in the study period decreased 10% (37.2–27%).
Figure 2 provides the annual percentage of ICSRs missing
age using the structured age field alone and the combined
approach (i.e., structured age field + NLP extracted ages).
Table 4 shows the number of ICSRs with age before and
after application of the NLP tool, displayed by age groups.
In the pediatric age group (≤ 16 years), the number of
ICSRs with age in the structured field after NLP application increased by 59%. For the younger pediatric age groups
(< 6 years), the number of ICSRs with age in the structured
field after NLP application was substantially higher (more
than doubled) compared to the number of ICSRs before
NLP application. In contrast, for the older age groups (≥
17 years), the increase in the number of ICSRs with age
in the structured field was more moderate (increase by less
than 20%).

4 Discussion
As the overall number of FAERS ICSRs increased from
2002 to 2018, the percentage of ICSRs with missing age
in the structured field doubled. This significant increase

Percent change calculated as: (number of reports after NLP − number of reports before NLP) × 100 / number of reports before NLP

provided the impetus for exploring solutions to support
extraction of age from the unstructured case narrative.
Improving patient age ascertainment from ICSRs will aid in
age-specific safety surveillance activities. We did not identify other published studies that focused on the extraction
of age from narratives except the publication by Wunnava
et al. This previous study explored different methods for
the extraction of age from ICSR narratives and observed
that a rule-based text string search performed better than
those based on other methods studied; their text string search
algorithm for age in 60 ICSRs achieved a sensitivity of 83%,
PPV of 89%, and F-measure of 86% [12]. Our validation
of the algorithm in a dataset of 1500 ICSRs, using the text
string search for age (reported in months or years), achieved
a sensitivity of 98.5%, PPV of 94.9%, and F-measure of
96.7% for all reports. We further compared the algorithm’s
performance among reports with age missing/not missing
in the structured field. The performance of the NLP tool
depends on the prevalence of relevant age in narratives and
is restricted if the prevalence is low.
While advances have been made in the use of NLP to
extract biomedical information from various data sources,
our analysis demonstrated that a straightforward text stringsearching algorithm could extract a numerical age from an
ICSR’s narrative free-text with high performance. This finding is significant because this rule-based extraction method
is easy to implement. Unlike more sophisticated machine
learning-based methods, the use of rule-based extraction
does not require the need to train datasets. Furthermore, the
text string search algorithm is interoperable across different
databases. In addition to FAERS, this tool may be beneficial for implementation in other databases containing patient
information where age may not be consistently available in
a structured field but otherwise reported in an unstructured
narrative or free-text field. The high performance of this tool
supports its implementation in pharmacovigilance practices.
A new data field that considers both the structured age
field and narrative-extracted age information can reduce the
manual curation performed on ICSRs missing age in the
structured field. For the application of NLP to ICSRs, we
determined the patient age using a combined approach considering the structured age field first if a value was present,
then applied the NLP extracted age only if a value was missing in the structured age field. Application of NLP to ICSRs
from 2002 to 2018 using the combined approach decreased
the number of ICSRs missing an age from 3.8 to 2.8 million (10% of the total number of ICSRs). We observed more
than 50% increase in the number of ICSRs pertaining to
the pediatric age group. Postmarketing safety information
for pediatrics is especially important because of the limited
number of pediatric patients in clinical trials and off-label
usage [18]. Additionally, it is not possible to identify all risks
of a product from premarketing clinical trials. Therefore,

P. Pham et al.

postmarketing safety surveillance furthers our understanding
of a product’s safety in pediatric patients. However, pediatric ICSRs account for a very small percentage of the total
ICSRs in the FAERS database (3% during the study period).
In consideration of the relatively low number of pediatric
ICSRs in FAERS, as well as the known limitations of spontaneous databases, such as underreporting, it is critical to
increase the ability to accurately identify and retrieve additional pediatric ICSRs in the database. Further research is
needed to determine the implications of using this derived
age field for signal identification (e.g., incorporation into
signaling algorithms).
We have two hypotheses for the observed larger percentage increase of ICSRs for pediatrics relative to adult age
groups following NLP. First, there may be differential inclusion of age information by reporters in an ICSR’s narrative due to the perceived greater importance of providing
age information for pediatrics relative to other age groups.
Second, the disproportional change may also be attributed
to false positive errors. For 30 of 45 (67%) observed false
positive errors, NLP incorrectly extracted a value for age
that was less than 17 years. This is not surprising given the
most common false positive error was the extraction of a
value associated with other time frames, such as treatment
duration and event onset. These time frames are commonly
described with small numbers (e.g., 1 year ago). The small
sample of pediatric cases and false positives limits our ability to draw more definitive conclusions, but the performance
of the tool in the pediatric ICSR subset may benefit from
additional evaluation.
Our qualitative error analysis identified several areas for
improvement. Notably, although the NLP algorithm extracts
the first instance of an age value preceding terms related
to “years” (if none detected, then “months”), the number
of false positive errors introduced by this method was low
(n = 3). The most common cause of false positive errors
was the extraction of a numerical value preceding the terms
related to “years” or “months” but unrelated to age. Modifications to the algorithm could be made to reduce the number of erroneous extractions for such values unrelated to
age. To reduce false negative errors and increase sensitivity,
potential improvements include modifying the algorithm to
capture missed extractions due to age reported with variations in spacing, paragraph breaks, or other non-numerical
characters, as non-numerical values, with a decimal, or in
weeks or days. However, any modifications may introduce
new errors and would require validation.
Despite the use of the NLP tool, we were unable to determine age for 27% of the ICSRs in the study period. Refinements to the tool may result in incremental improvements,
but it is unlikely they would substantially reduce missingness given the already high sensitivity. Major improvements
in missingness will need to come from improvements in the

reported data. Notably, age was less frequently missing in
ICSRs sent directly to the Agency via the MedWatch program. An ICSR may be missing age because the information
may be unknown to the reporter or protected for privacy
reasons [19].
While beyond the objective of the study to investigate
reasons for the trend in missingness, we explored missing
patterns in data fields relevant to age post hoc. Currently,
if age is not provided in the structured age field, FAERS
calculates age using the date of birth and event date when
both are available. We noted that the availability of date of
birth data was stable over time, but the annual proportion of
cases with an event date has decreased. It is unclear why this
occurs, but it may be due to the increase in reports associated
with industry-sponsored programs [6]. The completeness of
data fields from these types of programs is highly variable
[20, 21]. Jokinen et al. noted that certain types of programs
(e.g., patient assistance programs) have been associated with
lower vigiGrade scores (a measure of data completeness that
includes patient age) [21, 22]. Future work should explore
the reasons for the data trends.
There are some limitations to our study. We likely underestimated the availability of age in FAERS as some ICSRs
contain attachments that may include relevant age information (e.g., literature article). The NLP tool is currently
unable to evaluate text contained in attachments, but optical
character recognition technologies would make this possible
[23]. Additionally, we did not deduplicate ICSRs in the study
dataset; therefore, we are unable to account for the number
of unique ICSRs when we applied the NLP tool to ICSRs in
the study period. Although we performed the FAERS search
to retrieve the latest version of an ICSR, duplicate ICSRs
describing the same patient and adverse event may still occur
as a result of submission of ICSRs by different manufacturers or reporters. We did not deduplicate reports in the study
set of 1500 reports because we wanted to validate the NLP
tool for a random sample of reports that is representative of
the overall database during the study period (2002–2018).
We think validating the tool in a representative sample with
duplicates would reflect the reality that many researchers
are not able to deduplicate those reports when conducting their research using FAERS. Finally, our gold standard
discarded estimated ages, although an estimated age or age
group would be more useful than no age information.

5 Conclusions
This study demonstrated the potential for a rule-based text
mining NLP algorithm to extract patients’ age from the
narratives of post-marketing ICSRs thereby increasing the
number of ICSRs with age for analysis. The use of this tool
would facilitate pharmacovigilance practice and research

Enhancing Patient Age Ascertainment from Adverse Event Reports

using the FAERS data. The tool demonstrated good overall
performance; however, further improvements may be considered. Further research to expand the use of NLP to extract
information beyond age from unstructured data fields will
improve postmarketing surveillance.
