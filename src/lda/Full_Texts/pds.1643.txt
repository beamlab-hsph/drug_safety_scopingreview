SUMMARY
Background We detected disproportionate reporting of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) with HMG-CoA-reductase
inhibitors (statins) in the Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) spontaneous adverse event (AE) reporting system (AERS).
Purpose To describe the original ALS signal and to provide additional context for interpreting the signal by conducting
retrospective analyses of data from long-term, placebo-controlled clinical trials of statins.
Methods The ALS signal was detected using the multi-item gamma Poisson shrinker (MGPS) algorithm. All AERS cases
of ALS reported in association with use of a statin were individually reviewed by two FDA neurologists. Manufacturers of
lovastatin, pravastatin, simvastatin, fluvastatin, atorvastatin, cerivastatin, and rosuvastatin were requested to provide the
number of cases of ALS diagnosed during all of their placebo-controlled statin trials that were at least 6 months in duration.
Results There were 91 US and foreign reports of ALS with statins in AERS. The data mining signal scores for ALS and
statins ranged from 8.5 to 1.6. Data were obtained from 41 statin clinical trials ranging in duration from 6 months to 5 years
and representing approximately 200 000 patient–years of exposure to statin and approximately 200 000 patient–years of
exposure to placebo. Nine cases of ALS were reported in statin-treated patients and 10 cases in placebo-treated patients.
Conclusions Although we observed a data mining signal for ALS with statins in FDA’s AERS, retrospective analyses of
41 statin clinical trials did not reveal an increased incidence of ALS in subjects treated with a statin compared with placebo.

INTRODUCTION
HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, or statins, are the
most widely prescribed class of lipid-altering drugs.
These compounds have been shown to decrease total

an evaluation of a data mining signal for als
mortality and reduce the risks for myocardial
infarction, stroke, and revascularization procedures.1
During the past 5 years, approximately 80% of statin
prescriptions in the US have been dispensed to patients
older than 50 years of age, with an equal proportion
received by men and women.2 Muscle symptoms, such
as weakness or pain, are reported in up to 15% of statin
users.3,4 Rhabdomyolysis, or muscle cell destruction,
occurs at a rate of approximately 1.6 patients per
100 000 patient–years.5
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive, fatal neurodegenerative disorder characterized by
destruction of motor neurons in the brain and spinal
cord with resultant degeneration of motor axons to the
neuromuscular junction.6,7 Although the cause of ALS
remains unknown, it is believed to result from more
than one pathogenic mechanism. ALS is not a primary
disorder of muscle. The mean age of onset of ALS
symptoms in one recent study was 63 years with an
average time between onset of symptoms—often
muscle weakness—and diagnosis being 13 months.8
The annual incidence of sporadic ALS is estimated to
be 1.5–2 cases per 100 000 persons, with males
affected slightly more often than females.9 The
incidence of ALS increases with age up until the
eighth decade of life.10
Using techniques to data mine spontaneousreported adverse event (AE) databases, we and others
observed a disproportionate number of reports for
ALS in association with statin use.11 Here we analyze
data from post-marketing reports and clinical trials to
gain a better understanding of the data mining signal
for ALS and statins.
METHODS
MGPS data mining analysis
Data mining, defined as the use of computerized
algorithms to discover patterns of associations in large
databases, is used by Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) to identify disproportionate (higher than
expected) reporting relationships of AEs associated
with drugs or other therapeutic products in the FDA’s
AE reporting system (AERS).12 The data mining
method used by FDA applies an empirical Bayes
multi-item gamma Poisson shrinker (MGPS) algorithm and detailed stratification, as described elsewhere.13–15 In brief, the MGPS algorithm computes
the empirical Bayes geometric mean (EBGM) and a
two-sided 95% confidence interval (EB05, EB95) for
each observed drug-AE combination in AERS. An
EBGM of 2 indicates the event is reported two times

more frequently than statistically expected when
considering all other drugs and events in AERS. In
general, FDA uses an EB05 or EBGM greater than 2 as
a screening threshold to identify potential safety
signals.16,17 To increase sensitivity when exploring
very serious or fatal outcomes, FDA expands the
screening threshold by examining the whole range of
EBGM scores and confidence limits for the drug-AE
pair being examined.
Post-marketing reports of ALS
FDA’s AERS is a database containing more than four
million post-marketing drug and biologic AE reports
submitted to FDA, either directly or through
manufacturers. To aid in retrieval of the reports,
FDA codes the reported AEs using a standardized
international terminology, Medical Dictionary for
Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). We searched AERS
for reports coded with the MedDRA preferred term,
‘‘ALS’’ or ‘‘motor neurone disease.’’ We also
performed an additional wildcard search of AERS,
looking for spelling variations, abbreviations (e.g.,
ALS), and other terms used to refer to ALS (e.g., Lou
Gehrig’s disease). The ALS reports were limited to
those associated with any statin ever marketed in the
United States (atorvastatin, cerivastatin, fluvastatin,
lovastatin, pravastatin, rosuvastatin, and simvastatin).
The search covered the period from market launch of
each statin through 31 December 2006. The ALS
reports associated with statin use were downloaded,
duplicates removed, and the cases individually
reviewed by two FDA neurologists. The limited data
available in the AERS reports precluded a reasonable
application of standard ALS diagnostic criteria (i.e.,
the El Escorial criteria or the Airlie House criteria).7,18
Therefore, qualitative criteria were developed to
reflect the level of confidence that the patient in a
given AERS report actually had ALS (Table 1). Using
these criteria, each case was classified using the terms
‘‘definite ALS,’’ ‘‘probable ALS,’’ ‘‘possible ALS,’’ or
‘‘not ALS.’’ It must be noted that these terms, although
very similar, are not related to any specific criteria
used in clinical practice or clinical research such as the
El Escorial or Airlie House criteria. As used in this
report, these terms simply reflected the level of
confidence of the reviewing FDA neurologists that a
patient actually had ALS. In the absence of additional
data, all cases that were classified as definite, probable,
or possible ALS were included in statistical calculations to assess an association between ALS and
statin exposure. Individual case reports were excluded
from further analysis if (1) the patient’s physician did

Table 1. Qualitative criteria used by FDA for classifying ALS case reports in AERS
Definite ALS

Either one of the following is true:
 Specific clinical, laboratory, and electrophysiological data are sufficient to conclude that the patient had ALS
 Clinical, laboratory, and electrophysiological data are suggestive of ALS, and the diagnosis was made by a
neurologist with neuromuscular or ALS expertise
Probable ALS Either one of the following is true:
 Clinical, laboratory, and electrophysiological data are suggestive of ALS, and there is no information to
suggest that the patient had an alternative diagnosis
 The diagnosis was made by a neurologist with neuromuscular or ALS expertise, and there is no information to
suggest that the patient had an alternative diagnosis
Possible ALS Any physician (either a neurologist without ALS expertise or a non-neurologist) diagnosed the patient as having ALS,
and there is no clinical, laboratory, or electrophysiological data sufficient to refute that diagnosis
Not ALS
Any one of the following is true:
 The patient’s physician did not diagnose the patient as having ALS
 Specific clinical, laboratory, and electrophysiological data are sufficient to conclude that the patient had an
alternative diagnosis and did not have ALS. Examples include clinical features such as prominent sensory, sphincter,
autonomic, or cognitive findings, electrodiagnostic features such as unequivocal conduction block, demyelinating
features, > 20% decrement, or neuroimaging features such as compression of brain stem/spinal cord or other
abnormalities that can explain the clinical findings
 The case report specifies that ALS is in the differential diagnosis of the patient’s condition (i.e., ALS is one of
several possible diagnoses under consideration), in the absence of a diagnosis of ALS or additional clinical data to
support the diagnosis of ALS

not diagnose the patient as having ALS, (2) data were
sufficient to conclude that the patient had an
alternative diagnosis and did not have ALS (see
Table 1 for examples), (3) the report specified ALS as
one of several differential diagnoses of the patient’s
condition, in the absence of a diagnosis of ALS or
additional data to support the diagnosis of ALS, (4) the
reporting physician did not see the patient, or (5) the
statin was started after the patient was diagnosed with
ALS.
Because there are reliable statin prescription use
data for the US, we focused our analyses on domestic
reports of ALS. For these reports, attempts were made
to obtain or verify from the individuals who submitted
the reports the following data elements: age, gender,
statin name and dose, time interval between the statin
start date and onset of ALS symptoms, discontinuation
or continuation of statin and outcome of clinical
course, use of other statins or non-statin lipid-lowering
drugs, laboratory testing, and confirmation of diagnosis.
Reporting rates
To provide a rough perspective on the number of ALS
cases reported to AERS, we estimated the cumulative
population exposure to statins based on prescription
data obtained from Verispan, LLC.2 Data for the years
1991–2001 were obtained from the source prescription audit, which sampled retail pharmacies, and data
from 2002 to 2006 were obtained from Vector OneTM:
Copyright # 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

National (VONA), which includes an expanded
sample of retail pharmacies as well as basic
demographic data on the patients filling prescriptions.
As an approximation, we took 12 prescriptions to
represent 1 patient–year of exposure. This estimate is
supported by the observation that the mean duration
for statin prescriptions tends to be slightly over
1 month in the Verispan VONA database.2 For
example, in 2006, statin prescriptions had an average
supply of 34.6 days.
Clinical trials data
Manufacturers of all statins ever approved for
marketing as monotherapy in the US were asked to
provide data from their placebo-controlled trials of
6 months duration or longer on the occurrence of ALS
in patients during on-study or during post-study
follow-up, which was generally no more than 30 days.
Data from patients in these trials who were exposed to
less than 6 months of treatment were also to be
provided and analyzed. Similar to FDA’s search of
AERS, the sponsors were asked to perform searches of
their clinical trial databases for terms related to any
suspected case of ALS, including wild card searches
for spelling variations, abbreviations, and other terms
used to refer to ALS such as motor neurone disease
and Lou Gehrig’s disease. In addition to the number of
patients randomized, data on exposure in person–years
for both active treatment and placebo were solicited.
Data were pooled for each individual statin and

incidence rates for active treatment and placebo were
calculated. In addition, data were pooled across drugs
to permit calculation of an overall incidence rate of
ALS with statin treatment and placebo.

RESULTS
MGPS analysis
Table 2 presents the data mining scores for statins and
ALS. Atorvastatin, simvastatin, and cerivastatin had
the highest EBGM scores (ranging from 8.5 to 3.9).
The other four statins had EBGM scores between 3.1
and 1.6. These results indicate that a statin–ALS
association was reported 1.6–8.5 times more frequently than expected when considering all other
drugs and all AEs reported for each drug in AERS.
Fenofibrate, a non-statin lipid-altering drug, had an
EBGM score of 5.6.
Post-marketing reports of ALS
In 2006, AERS contains 155 126 AE reports (crude
counts) associated with statin use, of which 109
(0.06%) mentioned ALS, Lou Gehrig’s disease, or
motor neurone disease. Eighteen of the 109 reports
were excluded for the following reasons. As determined by either the reporting physician or review by
two FDA neurologists, 15 of the 18 patients did not
have ALS, of which 12 reports provided an alternative
diagnosis (e.g., familial spastic paraparesis, paraneoplastic acute axonal neuropathy, Charcot–Marie–
Tooth). Two patients were not seen by the reporting
physician, and one patient who was taking riluzole
started a statin after ALS was diagnosed. Of the

91 cases assessed by FDA neurologists as ALS,
57 were from the US (Table 3). Thirty-two of the
57 cases provided the statin dose, but there were too
few values for any one statin to make a meaningful
assessment of a dose-relationship. No reported ALS
case described the use of a maximum FDArecommended statin dose. Three cases (cerivastatin:
2; atorvastatin: 1) reported that ALS symptoms started
after their statin was discontinued. A 75-year-old male
on cerivastatin for about 1 year, stopped cerivastatin
when it was withdrawn from the US market by FDA
due to a notably higher risk for rhabdomyolysis
compared with other statins. Two months later this
man experienced ALS symptoms. A 68-year-old
female took both cerivastatin and gemfibrozil for
about 4 months, which were discontinued when she
experienced rhabdomyolysis. Eight months later, she
developed symptoms of ALS. The atorvastatinassociated case involved a 72-year-old male who
took atorvastatin for 2 weeks but stopped it because of
lower extremity muscle weakness and cramping. He
reported that he developed his ‘‘first ALS symptoms’’
of hand weakness 9 months after atorvastatin was
stopped. A total 54 of the 57 cases that reported initial
ALS symptoms, 56% (n ¼ 30) reported muscle
weakness, 24% (n ¼ 13) reported bulbar symptoms
such as slurred speech or difficulty swallowing, and
11% (n ¼ 6) reported both muscle weakness and
bulbar symptoms. Seventy-nine per cent (n ¼ 45)
discontinued their statin after the onset of ALS
symptoms. However, only one case indicated that the
patient improved after the statin was discontinued. For
this case, the reporting physician stated the patient
improved, ‘‘but (was) not yet recovered.’’
Forty-five of the 57 cases provided a medication
history. The use of b-blockers was most frequently
reported (n ¼ 13), followed by diuretics (n ¼ 9),
calcium channel blockers (n ¼ 9), angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (n ¼ 8), and thyroid hormone
replacement (n ¼ 5). Three patients stated they were not
using any concurrent medications. Fifteen cases
indicated they had used other statins (either before or
after starting the suspect statin they associated with
their onset of ALS symptoms). Seven cases described
the use of non-statin lipid-lowering drugs, of which four
(three on niacin, one taking fenofibrate) reported that
they were using concurrently with the suspect statin at
the onset of their ALS symptoms. Too few cases (less
than 10) described pre- and post-statin serum creatine
kinase or cholesterol levels for additional analyses.
Fifty-three per cent of the cases (n ¼ 30) were
submitted initially by consumers, 33% (n ¼ 19) were
submitted initially by physicians.

Reporting rates
The Verispan US retail pharmacy prescription data for
the years 1991–2006 for all statins shows a total of
1.06 billion prescriptions for single-ingredient statins,
with the annual number of prescriptions steadily
increasing over time. If one allocates 12 prescriptions
per year, this number of prescriptions would represent
approximately 88 million patient–years of statin use
for 1991–2006. This is likely to be an underestimate
since retail pharmacy data do not include mail order or
long-term care prescriptions.
Assuming a US population incidence of two cases
of ALS per 100 000 persons per year, (i.e., 20 per
million person–years), the expected number of ALS
cases during 88 million patient–years of US statin use
would be 20 per million per year multiplied by
88 million patient–years, or approximately 1700 cases
of ALS expected among US statin users, for the years
1991–2006. This compares to the 57 US cases of ALS
reported in AERS for that same 1991–2006 period.
Focusing on atorvastatin alone, similar calculations
yield an estimate of 38.6 million person–years of

exposure in the US for 1997–2006, corresponding to
approximately 770 expected cases of ALS, with
29 cases reported in AERS. The population rate of
ALS among statin users is likely to be even higher than
the general population incidence of 20 per million per
year, since statin users tend to be older and ALS
incidence increases with age. Then again, only a
fraction of AEs suspected of being drug-related are
submitted to AERS by consumers and healthcare
providers.
Clinical trial data
Data were obtained on the incidence of ALS with
seven individual statin compounds studied in
41 clinical trials (Table 4). There was considerable
variability in the amount of data available from longterm trials for individual statins. There were a total of
64 602 patients randomized to statin therapy in these
trials, for a total exposure of 212 775 person–years to
statin treatment (mean duration of treatment of
3.3 years). For placebo, there were a total of

One of these three patients possibly had early symptoms of ALS at study entry.

56 362 patients with a total exposure of 200 078 person–years (mean duration of treatment of 3.5 years). A
total of 19 cases of ALS were reported in these clinical
trials, 9 with statin therapy and 10 with placebo.
Incidence rates for treatment with individual statin
compounds ranged from 0 to 10.6 per 100 000 person–
years. Data for all statin arms pooled yielded a statin
incidence rate of 4.2 per 100 000 person–years. For
placebo, incidence rates for individual clinical trial
programs ranged from 0 to 16.5 per 100 000 person–
years. Data for all placebo arms pooled yielded a
placebo incidence rate of 5.0 per 100 000 person–
years.

DISCUSSION
Applying data mining methods to FDA’s AERS, we
found disproportionate reporting of ALS with statins.
Our findings confirm those of Edwards et al. who,
screening Vigibase, the spontaneous AE reporting
database for the World Health Organization Programme for International Drug Monitoring, which
contains approximately 60% of the same data as
FDA’s AERS, found a data mining signal for an ALSlike syndrome with statins.11 The limitations of
databases containing spontaneous reported AEs are
well known and include lack of randomization and
formal control groups, large variability in the quality
and quantity of information included in the reports,

and influence by reporting biases. Data mining using
MGPS helps raise—in a hypothesis-free manner—
awareness about potential safety signals, which in
some cases require follow-up analysis and independent confirmation.
Our review of ALS case reports in AERS did not
identify a qualitative attribution that would suggest a
difference in risk reflected by ALS cases reported with
statin use to FDA and sporadic ALS, the most
common form of the disorder. The per cent of ALS
reports in AERS by statin reflects statin use patterns in
that, for the described reporting period (1991–2006),
atorvastatin, which is associated with 50% of the
statin–ALS reports in AERS, accounts for 44% of
statin prescriptions dispensed by US retail pharmacies, followed by simvastatin (23%), lovastatin (11%),
and pravastatin (13%).2 The mean reported age in our
ALS–statin case series from AERS was 67 years, with
45% of cases 70 years of age or older. These
demographic characteristics are consistent with
population-based studies of ALS in the United
States.19,20 Of note, the majority of cases did not
report improvement in their clinical course following
discontinuation of statin treatment.
There are published reports of amnesia, cognitive
decline, and neuropathy in patients exposed to
statins.21–25 Although data from controlled trials have
not shown significant increases in risk for nervous
system AEs in patients randomized to statins, most of
these compounds are lipophilic and presumably cross
the blood-brain barrier.26–29 It is not unreasonable

therefore to speculate that in rare cases statins
cause adverse neurological reactions. Yet it would
be difficult to invoke case reports of adverse nervous
system events, most of which were reversible upon
statin discontinuation, as providing biological plausibility for statins to act as initiators of an irreversible
motor neurone disease such as ALS. In fact, in vitro
data indicate that statins may reduce inflammatory
cytokine production by microglia and astrocytes, a
process implicated in the pathogenesis of ALS.30,31
The favorable neuroinflammatory effects of statins
provide the rationale for an ongoing study testing the
hypothesis that atorvastatin favorably alters the
clinical course in patients with ALS.32 On the other
hand, recent observational studies suggest that
hyperlipidemia may be associated with longer survival
in patients with ALS, and that statin therapy may lead
to more rapid loss of functioning.33,34
Tsivgoulis and others suggest that statins may
unmask neuromuscular disorders such as myotonic
dystrophy, mitochondrial myopathy, rippling muscle
disease (myopathy with clinical features of muscle
hyperexcitability and a predominantly autosomal
dominant pattern of inheritance), and myasthenia
gravis.35–39 Although we cannot discount the possibility
that statins may unmask or exacerbate the muscle
weakness of ALS—leading to earlier subjective
symptoms, evaluation, and diagnosis—reporting bias
should be given serious consideration as a possible
explanation for spontaneous reports of ALS (and
neuromuscular disorders) in patients taking statins.
That the typical age of onset for ALS is very close to the
modal age of statin users ensures that a portion of
individuals who develop ALS will be on or will have
recently started statin therapy. Indeed, more than 50% of
the patients in our case series initiated statin treatment
within 1 year of the onset of ALS symptoms. Since
muscle weakness is common to both ALS and statin use,
it would not be unusual for some healthcare professionals and patients to suspect that a statin was the
cause of a condition marked by muscle weakness such
as ALS. The fact that we observed a data mining signal
(i.e., EB05 > 2.0) for ALS with fenofibrate, another
lipid-altering drug associated with myopathy, as well as
signals with statins for polymyositis, dermatomyositis,
and polymyalgia rheumatica, immune-based disorders
with prominent muscle symptomatology (data not
shown), further supports the possibility that reporting
bias may have played a role in the disproportionate
reporting of ALS with use of statins.
In a pooled analysis of data from 41 statin clinical
trials ranging in length from 6 months to 5 years and
comprising roughly 400 000 person–years of

exposure, the incidence rates of ALS were 4.2 per
100 000 person–years in statin-treated patients and 5.0
per 100 000 person–years in placebo-treated patients.
These findings are reassuring insofar as the clinical
trial data are less subject to the biases and limitations
that may compromise analyses of spontaneously
reported AE data and case reports. There are, however,
shortcomings of the clinical trials. First, none of the
studies were designed to examine the incidence of
ALS, and in the absence of formal adjudication of the
cases, we cannot discount the possibility of misdiagnosis. Second, patients with prior statin use were
allowed to take part in the trials. Inclusion of statintolerant patients would reduce the chances of
detecting severe statin-induced AEs. Third, patients
were generally only followed for up to 30 days
following discontinuation from the trials. Thus, we
may have missed cases of ALS diagnosed at later time
points following withdrawal from the trials. Finally,
despite the impressive size of the pooled trial database,
only 19 cases of ALS were identified. Accordingly, the
clinical trial data cannot rule out a small excess risk for
ALS following exposure to statins.
Given that the use of statins has increased steadily
since the first of the class was approved in the US in
1987, we might expect to see a cotemporaneous increase
in the incidence of ALS if statins increased the risk for
this neurodegenerative disorder. But as reported by
Sejvar and colleagues, the mortality rate for ALS—
which closely approximates the incidence rate—has
been relatively stable in the US between 1979 and
1998.40 Similarly, data from the Mayo Clinic’s
Rochester epidemiology project indicate an ALS
incidence in Olmstead County, MN of approximately
1.9 per 100 000 per year for the years 1998–2005
(personal communication, Eric Sorenson, MD), which is
consistent with the incidence rate of 1.7 per 100 000 per
year observed in that locality in the years prior to 1998.8
CONCLUSION
We found disproportionate reporting for ALS with
statins when data mining the FDA’s AERS. While we
cannot disregard the possibility that statins unmask or
exacerbate the muscle weakness of ALS, the weight of
evidence—the favorable neuroinflammatory properties of statins, the possible influence of reporting bias
in the data mining signals, the similar rates of ALS in
statin- and placebo-treated patients from long-term
clinical trials, and the relatively stable incidence of
ALS in the US during the past two decades, despite a
concurrent 30-fold increase in statin use—argues
against the possibility that treatment with statins

an evaluation of a data mining signal for als
initiates this neurodegenerative disorder. Nevertheless, given the expansive use of this class of drugs and
the dire consequences of ALS, any degree of
uncertainty justifies further investigation. To this
end, there is an ongoing case–control study examining
whether exposure to cholesterol-lowering drugs,
including statins, increase the risk of developing
ALS, or alter the disease progression of individuals
with ALS (personal communication, Lorene M.
Nelson, PhD).
As we await these results, it is important to not lose
sight of one certainty: in populations with or at high
risk for cardiovascular disease, controlled-clinical trial
data indicate that the benefits of statins outweigh the
risks.41
