ABSTRACT
Purpose The aim of this study was to assess the impact of automatically detected adverse event signals from text and open-source data on
the prediction of drug label changes.
Methods Open-source adverse effect data were collected from FAERS, Yellow Cards and SIDER databases. A shallow linguistic
relation extraction system (JSRE) was applied for extraction of adverse effects from MEDLINE case reports. Statistical approach was
applied on the extracted datasets for signal detection and subsequent prediction of label changes issued for 29 drugs by the UK
Regulatory Authority in 2009.
Results 76% of drug label changes were automatically predicted. Out of these, 6% of drug label changes were detected only by text mining.
JSRE enabled precise identiﬁcation of four adverse drug events from MEDLINE that were undetectable otherwise.
Conclusions Changes in drug labels can be predicted automatically using data and text mining techniques. Text mining technology is mature and well-placed to support the pharmacovigilance tasks. Copyright © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

INTRODUCTION
Worsening of a drug’s risk-to-beneﬁt ratio can lead regulatory authorities to take actions aiming at mitigating or
withdrawing the use of the drug. A very ﬁrst step in such
actions is the issue of a safety warning that has modest impact1 on the usage of a drug. One important way by which
regulatory authorities may act on safety warning issuance
is through changes in drug labels. Drug labels (also referred as leaﬂets) contain information provided by manufacturers on the drug usage, characteristics and safety.§

Therefore, changes in safety labels can have a strong
impact on the way drugs can be used by physicians
and patients.
Adverse drug events are the core data that drive the
regulator’s decision-making process. While clinical
studies and spontaneous adverse reporting systems
provide the major source of adverse drug events,
scientiﬁc literature provides a secondary but a valuable
data source. The detection of potential adverse drug
events from literature is often a manual process done
by pharmacovigilance experts mainly using literature
databases and information retrieval systems.
Several examples of successful application of text
mining techniques for adverse event detection are
available.2–4 A text mining system originally developed to detect semantic relations between nouns
occurring in English sentences2 was shown to perform
well in detecting drug–drug interactions in biomedical
text3 upon customization. The same text mining

1190

h. gurulingappa et al.

system3 was recently applied to detect potential adverse drug events with good results.4 To the best of
our knowledge, neither a benchmark of different text
mining technologies for adverse drug event detection
nor an evaluation of the practical impact of automatically extracted information on pharmacovigilance processes have been reported so far.
Thus, the aim of this paper is to conduct a study on
extraction of adverse event signals from open-source
adverse event reports and MEDLINE case reports,
and subsequent detection of drug safety signals using
statistical approaches. Predicted signals were used to
assess their potential impact on the prediction of
changes in drug safety labels.

Text mining systems applied for adverse event detection. Java Simple Relationship Extraction (JSRE)
is an open-source publicly available¶ machine learning-based relationship extraction system.2 JSRE was
trained over ADE-EXT corpus for the detection of relations between drugs and adverse events co-occurring
within sentences of case reports. JSRE requires pretagging of drugs and adverse events in sentences prior
to relation detection.
Peregrine is a publicly available∥ dictionary-based
named entity recognition system.7 Peregrine was
loaded with chemical and medical dictionaries, i.e.
DrugBank** and MedDRA††, respectively, for the
identiﬁcation of sentence-level co-occurring drug and
condition named entities.

METHODS
Extraction of adverse events from MEDLINE
Characteristics of corpora. The ADE-EXT corpus5
was used as a reference for training and evaluation of performances of text mining system applied for adverse
event extraction from MEDLINE case reports. The corpus
contains 2972 abstracts randomly sampled from the
MEDLINE query that returned nearly 29 800 abstracts.
"adverse effects"[sh] AND (hasabstract[text] AND Case
Reports[ptyp]) AND "drug therapy"[sh] AND English
[lang] AND (Case Reports[ptyp] AND ("1"[PDAT] :
"2009/12/31"[PDAT])).

Sampled abstracts were annotated with drugs and
conditions as well as relationships occurring between
them at the sentence level.6 Annotations were
performed by three annotators followed by systematic
harmonization to remove conﬂicting and error-prone
annotations. The corpus contains 7528 drugs and
9517 condition annotations. There are 6701 positive
and 5345 negative relations between drugs and conditions occurring within the sentences.
The ADE-EXT corpus contains annotations of “drug”
related to “condition” as positive if and only if the drug
is causing/worsening the condition, e.g.sentence-1 (S1):
Tamoxifene was used to treat breast cancer.sentence-2
(S2): Tamoxifene caused liver failure in a patient.In
ADE-EXT corpus, the positive annotation would be
“S2: Tamoxifene - liver failure” and the negative annotation would be “S1: Tamoxifene - breast cancer”.
Apart from the ADE-EXT corpus, a set of 1 417 079 articles was extracted from MEDLINE that were published
before 2009/01/01. This corpus, namely MEDLINE2008, was used for large-scale extraction of adverse
events from text that can be subjected to signal detection.

Training the text mining systems and large-scale adverse
event extraction. From the previous experiments, it has
been demonstrated that training the JSRE on the ADEEXT corpus and evaluation can deliver relationship
extraction results with F-score of 0.87 (Precision = 0.86
and Recall = 0.89). Gurulingappa et al., 20125 give a
brief insight on methodological aspects and performance
of the relationship extraction. Since the JSRE showed
high conﬁdence in accurate adverse event (positive
labeled) relationship extraction from text, it was used
for large-scale relation extraction from MEDLINE.
In the ﬁrst step, Peregrine was applied over the
MEDLINE-2008 corpus for tagging drugs and condition names co-occurring within the sentences. A JSRE
model trained over the ADE-EXT corpus was applied
for classiﬁcation of relationships between co-occurring
drugs and conditions tagged within sentences of the
MEDLINE-2008 corpus. As a result of relationship
classiﬁcation, 165 680 adverse event relationships
were extracted between 1611 drugs and 5079 conditions from 70 024 articles.

automatic detection of ade and prediction of drug label changes

in Drug Safety Updates (DSU).§§ It is very important
to understand that only a proportion of product label
changes are communicated via DSU, and as a result
this cannot be used as a complete list of changes that
have been made. Communication via DSU is based
on major changes to the beneﬁt/risk balance for a
medicine; this includes any new major safety information, major updates to prescribing advice and even
reminders. Therefore, many minor amendments will
not be included in DSU. The MHRA may communicate some of the other minor product label changes
through other means (drug alerts and variation
UKPARs); these again may only constitute a proportion of all changes made to a product label. These 62
drug label changes (62 drug-adverse event pairs)
served as a standard reference for comparing the
results of machine prediction.

Yellow Cards dataset. The Yellow Card Scheme is
run by the MHRA in the United Kingdom, established
in 1964. This is the main reporting system for spontaneous “suspected” Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR) of
the United Kingdom. Custom generated MS Excel
ﬁles of the publicly available Drug Analysis Prints¶¶
were obtained for 29 MHRA label-changed drugs
from the Yellow Cards database dated between 01/
07/1963 and 31/12/2008. Each Excel ﬁle contains
cumulative counts of outcomes for each drug-adverse
event coded using MedDRA Preferred Term. It is
important to note that causality is not proven for these
ADR reports – reporters are encouraged to report
spontaneous “suspected” ADRs, but the reporter does
not have to be sure that the drug caused the reaction
– a mere suspicion will sufﬁce. The limitations of a
spontaneous reporting scheme such as the Yellow
Card Scheme include an unknown level of
underreporting. ADR reporting rates may be
inﬂuenced by seriousness of reaction, their ease of
recognition or publicity about a drug. Yellow Card
data cannot be used to determine incidence of a particular ADR because denominator data are not available.
We are basing all the product information updates on
DSU alone. The monthly bulletin DSU is used to communicate some of the issues MHRA has identiﬁed;
however, note that not every single product information update is communicated this way. Publications
communicated via DSU articles can also be identiﬁed

1191

from other sources of evidence, such as epidemiological reviews, literature or other studies, so it is important to note that Yellow Card data is not the only
source. We therefore do not ascertain that there were
only 63 product label changes in 2008, but these were
the ones that we sought to automatically identify.
FAERS dataset. The FDA Adverse Event Reporting
System (FAERS)∥∥ is a database that contains information about adverse drug events submitted to FDA.
The data of the FAERS database is freely downloadable in different formats and contains data from
January 2004, updated quarterly thereafter. Each ﬁle
contains all the individual reports registered by
FAERS during the speciﬁed period for any drug. The
complete dataset was downloaded in SGML format.
For each of the 29 MHRA label-changed drugs, we
extracted the cumulative counts of outcomes for each
reaction submitted before 2009.
SIDER dataset. SIDER is a publicly available***
computer-readable side effect resource that connects
888 drugs to 1450 side-effect terms. It has been
constructed manually from the summary of product leaflets of each drug. SIDER version 1.0 was used in the
study for signal detection.8 Although the release date is
6 November 2009, the data present in SIDER has been
generated before 2009.††† For each of the 29 MHRA
label-changed drugs, adverse events were extracted from
the SIDER product leaﬂets. SIDER provides drugadverse event pairs in the form of table with frequency
information extracted from product leaﬂets.
MEDLINE dataset. This dataset contains drug-adverse
event pairs extracted by text mining from the
MEDLINE-2008 corpus (see Section 2.1). Only the 29
MHRA label-changed drugs were used.
Prediction of changes in drug safety labels
Three datasets used in the current study, i.e. FAERS,
Yellow Cards and MEDLINE for 29 drugs of interest,
were subjected to the signal detection process. Drug
safety signals were detected using the Multi-item Gamma
Poisson Shrinkage (MGPS) method9 extended to the
multiple comparison framework10 and implemented
within the publicly available R‡‡‡ PhViD package version 1.0.3.11 MGPS is one of the best statistical methods

used in pharmacovigilance for disproportionality analysis
(to estimate disproportionality in the frequency of
adverse events) and allows detecting signals. Unlike
other datasets, SIDER contains information extracted
from product leaﬂets and does not require statistical signal
generation. Therefore, SIDER was not subjected to
MGPS-based signal generation and all the drug-adverse

event pairs extracted from SIDER were treated as
signals. Signals detected from different datasets were
manually compared against 2009 MHRA drug label
changes. Figure 1 depicts the methodological workﬂow
applied for drug-adverse event extraction, signal detection and the prediction of drug label changes.
RESULTS
Prediction of label changes

Figure 1. Workﬂow applied for drug-adverse event extraction from various sources, signal detection and prediction of drug label changes

Upon application of MGPS over four datasets, drug-adverse event pairs that were qualiﬁed as valid drug safety
signals were extracted and manually compared to 62 instances in the MHRA label change dataset. Among 62
instances, 47 instances (i.e. 76%) could be predicted
through any one of the datasets (see Appendix 1). This
indicates that 76% of the drug label changes could be
automatically predicted through signals generated from
the open-source data. The reason for 24% unpredicted
label changes was due to the lack of data in the repositories used (i.e. MEDLINE, AERS, Yellow Cards or
SIDER) due to which no signals could be predicted
for the missing drugs.

different resources. It was striking to observe that (i)
MGPS-based signal detection helped in substantial
ﬁltration of drug-adverse event pairs thereby reducing
a lot of manual work and (ii) MGPS-based ﬁlter did
not discard any valuable information (drug-adverse
event pairs) that were reported in the 2009 label
change standard reference. Signals generated through
text/data mining that were not reported as 2009 label
changes (i.e. not present in the reference standard)
were not termed as “false positives” but rather
treated as signals requiring manual validation. The
reasons are:
a) Many predicted signals that did not lead to label
changes in 2009 were adverse events already documented in the drug labels.
b) For the remaining predicted signals, there was no
evidence of manual evaluation available to render
them as “false”.
Table 2 provides the counts of label changes that
could be predicted using each dataset.

identify four drug adverse event signals (label changes)
that were not detected by the other sources. This shows
the potential of text mining applications for ability to
detect novel signals from text and their subsequent
support to the pharmacovigilance activities.
CONCLUSIONS
This work demonstrates that up to 76% of drug label
changes could be predicted through data mining
methods using publicly available data. Furthermore,
text-mining solutions can deliver promising results
by detecting unreported adverse events and can add
value to the safety signal instantiation processes. The
Peregrine-JSRE hybrid system that delivered the
highest precision and recall on the ADE-EXT benchmark corpus was able to detect uniquely four adverse
drug events that were otherwise not found in the other
databases. This demonstrates the usability of welltuned text-mining software to support an important
pharmacovigilance task.
The results show a promising initial outcome of
using off-the-shelf text-mining tools to demonstrate
their value for the drug adverse-event detection. It is
useful to benchmark the capabilities of different text
mining systems against a common corpus and determine their abilities to detect potential safety signals.
Nevertheless, there are few limitations that authors
wish to address in the future studies. For instance, information extraction has been limited to MEDLINE
case reports. The model exhibited here may not adapt
straightforward to full-text articles or non-case reports.
Therefore, performance evaluation and training
requirements of entity recognition and relation extraction on a broad spectrum of corpora need to be
addressed. Further development of dedicated text
mining models, training the tools on different corpora
and/or ﬁne-tuning of system parameters will be
systematically investigated. Furthermore, the relative
abundance of inter-sentence relations vs. intra-sentence
relations should be assessed, and methods be selected
that detect inter-sentence relations. In the current study,
prediction of MHRA drug label changes has been

addressed. Similarity, ability to predict drug label
changes for various other regulatory authorities needs
to be investigated. Therefore, application of data
mining and text mining technologies could revolutionize the way in which decisions on drug safety could be
taken by safety experts in the near future.
