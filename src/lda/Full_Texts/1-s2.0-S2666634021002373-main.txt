SUMMARY

Context and significance

Background: As the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccination
campaign unfolds, it is important to continuously assess the real-world
safety of Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-authorized vaccines. Curation of large-scale electronic health records (EHRs) enables near-realtime safety evaluations that were not previously possible.
Methods: In this retrospective study, we deployed deep neural networks over a large EHR system to automatically curate the adverse effects mentioned by physicians in over 1.2 million clinical notes between
December 1, 2020 and April 20, 2021. We compared notes from 68,266
individuals who received at least one dose of BNT162b2 (n = 51,795) or
mRNA-1273 (n = 16,471) to notes from 68,266 unvaccinated individuals
who were matched by demographic, geographic, and clinical features.
Findings: Individuals vaccinated with BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 had a
higher rate of return to the clinic, but not the emergency department,
after both doses compared to unvaccinated controls. The most
frequently documented adverse effects within 7 days of each vaccine
dose included myalgia, headache, and fatigue, but the rates of EHR
documentation for each side effect were remarkably low compared to
those derived from active solicitation during clinical trials. Severe
events, including anaphylaxis, facial paralysis, and cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, were rare and occurred at similar frequencies in vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals.
Conclusions: This analysis of vaccine-related adverse effects from over
1.2 million EHR notes of more than 130,000 individuals reaffirms the
safety and tolerability of the FDA-authorized mRNA COVID-19 vaccines
in practice.
Funding: This study was funded by nference.

This is a study of the mRNA
COVID-19 vaccines developed by
Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna.
Although these vaccines have
been shown to be safe and
tolerated in clinical trials, it is
important to confirm their safety
profiles in practice. The results
from this study show that
individuals receiving these
vaccines are likely to experience
muscle and joint soreness, but
they are not more likely to seek
out emergent clinical care or
experience severe medical events
than unvaccinated individuals. As
one of the largest real-world
safety studies of COVID-19
vaccines to date, these data
reinforce that we should continue
expanding efforts to deliver more
vaccines with high confidence in
their safety.

INTRODUCTION
Following their Emergency Use Authorizations by the Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) in December of 2020, more than 280 million doses of BNT162b2 (Pfizer/BioNTech) and mRNA-1273 (Moderna) coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines
have been administered in the United States.1–3 Phase 3 trials demonstrated strong
efficacy and favorable safety profiles for these vaccines in the cohorts studied. Specifically, the trials showed 95.0% (95% confidence interval [CI], 90.3 to 97.6) and

94.1% (95% CI, 89.3 to 96.8%) efficacy for BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273, respectively.
Self-resolving mild to moderate adverse effects were common in vaccinated participants, while serious adverse effects occurred rarely and with a frequency comparable to placebo.4,5 Local adverse effects of any severity reported in these trials
included injection site pain (84.1%–92%), injection site swelling (10.5%–70%), and
injection site erythema (9.5%–14.6%). Systemic effects of any severity included fatigue (62.9%–70%), headache (55.1%–64.7%), myalgia (38.3%–61.5%), arthralgia
(23.6%–46.4%), chills (31.9%–45.4%), fever (14.2%–15.5%), and nausea/vomiting
(1.1%–23.0%).4,5
Consistent with Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommendations, early vaccination efforts (phase 1a) in the United States targeted healthcare
workers along with residents and staff at long-term care facilities, who are at
elevated risk to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 or experience severe COVID-19 relative to the general public.6–9 As the vaccines continue to be administered more
broadly, it is critical to continuously evaluate real-world safety and effectiveness
data from all those who have received these vaccines. This approach may validate
existing findings or highlight differences in the larger population compared to the
clinical trial experience with respect to vaccine efficacy and adverse effects, and it
will help to better quantify the frequency of rare severe adverse effects such as
anaphylaxis, which was widely reported but only observed in a small number of individuals after the authorization of both vaccines.10–14
As part of the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS) maintained by the
FDA, V-safe has recently been established to specifically monitor the safety profiles
of COVID-19 vaccines as they are administered to the public.15 V-safe is a voluntary
program into which vaccinated individuals can enroll. Once enrolled, participants
receive frequent reminders to complete surveys which document their side effects
electronically. Thus, this program will create an excellent resource of clinical-triallike safety data derived from significantly larger and more diverse patient populations than those who were enrolled in the phase 1/2 or 3 trials.
An important complementary approach to post-authorization surveillance of vaccine
efficacy and safety is via the real-time analysis of patient data stored in electronic
health record (EHR) systems. We have previously developed and described
augmented curation methods to rapidly create and compare cohorts of COVID-19
patients within a large EHR system, and we have recently applied these methods
to assess the real-world effectiveness of both BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 in over
68,000 individuals receiving these vaccines within the Mayo Clinic health system.16–20 Here, we expand on these efforts to study the adverse effects experienced
by these individuals after COVID-19 vaccination in the real-world setting.
It should be noted that the monitoring of vaccine-associated adverse effects in clinical trials or post-marketing surveillance efforts like V-safe is quite different from such
monitoring in routine clinical practice. In clinical trials, participants are aware that
they may be receiving an experimental product, and adverse effect reporting is
encouraged or solicited. Such solicitation is likely to increase the rate of reported
adverse effects, as is demonstrated by the high percentage of placebo-treated participants who report adverse effects. Similarly, as was previously noted, side effect
reporting is actively solicited from V-safe participants via frequent surveys. On the
other hand, individuals receiving a COVID-19 vaccine during the mass vaccination
campaign are informed that they are likely to experience certain adverse effects
and can even be discouraged from seeking medical attention unless the symptom

is particularly severe. Thus, adverse effects are likely to be captured in EHR notes
only for individuals who experience symptoms that are severe or persistent enough
to warrant a return to clinic or who happen to have a previously scheduled routine
clinical visit in the post-vaccination time period. Accordingly, the intention of our
analysis is not to determine whether real-world data recapitulate the adverse effect
frequencies reported in prior trials. Instead, it is to establish the rates at which individuals actually report potential vaccine-associated adverse effects to healthcare
practitioners (HCPs) and determine whether these rates of adverse effect reporting
are unexpectedly high.
To address the latter point, it is critical to establish the baseline frequency at which
each adverse effect is expected to be documented in the clinical notes of our vaccinated cohort. We thus employed a one-to-one propensity matching procedure to
derive a cohort of unvaccinated individuals who are balanced for demographic factors, residential location, history of SARS-CoV-2 and influenza testing, and current
residence at long-term care facilities (see STAR Methods), and we curated their clinical notes over specified time periods to quantify the frequency of the defined symptoms of interest.21 This propensity-matched group serves a purpose similar to that of
the placebo arm in clinical trial safety assessments, allowing us to contextualize and
better interpret the absolute rates of adverse effects documented in the notes of
vaccinated individuals. The results of this study support the safety and tolerability
of both BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 in clinical practice, further strengthening the
case for the rapid and broad distribution of these vaccines to the public.

RESULTS
Vaccinated individuals are more likely to return to clinic after both doses
Of the 324,992 eligible adults in the Mayo Clinic health system, 85,676 had received
at least one dose of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine at the time of this study. We were
able to match 68,266 of these vaccinated individuals (nBNT162b2 = 51,795; nmRNA1273 = 16,471) to the same number of unvaccinated individuals with similar demographic, clinical, and geographic features (Figure 1; Tables S1 and S2). To assess
rates of clinical follow-up after study enrollment, we compared the number of vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals with EHR notes within 7, 14, or 21 days of each
actual or assigned vaccination date. In the 7 days after the first vaccine dose, 9,998 of
the 51,795 (19.3%) individuals receiving BNT162b2 had at least one EHR note
compared to 7,457 of 51,795 (14.4%) unvaccinated individuals (odds ratio, 1.42;
95% CI, [1.38–1.47]) (Table 1). The rates of return to clinic were also moderately
higher in BNT162b2-vaccinated individuals within 14 and 21 days of the first dose
(odds ratio14 days, 1.47 [1.43–1.51]; odds ratio21 days, 1.49 [1.45–1.53]) (Table 1).
Individuals receiving mRNA-1273 were also more likely to return to the clinic after
their first dose compared to matched unvaccinated controls. Within 7 days of the
first dose, 3,891 of 16,471 (23.62%) vaccinated individuals had at least one EHR
note compared to 2,734 of 16,471 (16.6%) unvaccinated individuals (odds ratio,
1.55 [1.47–1.64]) (Table 1). Similar increases were also observed within 14 and
21 days of receiving the first dose of mRNA-1273 (odds ratio14 days, 1.71 [1.63–
1.8]; odds ratio21 days, 1.81 [1.73–1.89]) (Table 1).
Among individuals receiving two doses of BNT162b2 (n = 39,058), the rates of return
to clinic were again moderately higher than those of unvaccinated controls within 7,
14, and 21 days of the second dose (odds ratio7 days, 1.46 [1.4–1.51]; odds
ratio14 days, 1.49 [1.44–1.54]; odds ratio21 days, 1.53 [1.49–1.58]) (Table 2). Individuals

Figure 1. Schematic illustration of participant selection and study design
The vaccinated cohort is composed 68,266 individuals from the Mayo Clinic and associated health
systems who received at least one dose of BNT162b2 (Pfizer/BioNTech; n = 51,795) or mRNA-1273
(Moderna; n = 16,471) between December 1, 2020 and April 20, 2021 and did not test positive for
SARS-CoV-2 prior to their first vaccination. A control cohort of unvaccinated individuals was
generated via a combination of exact matching parameters and one-to-one propensity score
matching, yielding 68,266 individuals with similar distributions of age, sex, race, ethnicity,
residential location, number of prior influenza and SARS-CoV-2 PCR tests in the past year, and
current long-term care residence status. For each cohort, the incidence rates of several adverse
effects (e.g., myalgia) were calculated for the 7 days following the first dose and, separately, for the
7 days following the second dose. For a given adverse effect, the incidence rate ratio (IRR) and the
corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated to determine whether individuals
receiving BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 were more likely to experience the event during these intervals
than their matched unvaccinated controls. Incidence rates and IRRs were also calculated for the 14
and 21 days following each vaccine dose.

receiving two doses of mRNA-1273 (n = 11,851) also had higher odds of contributing
EHR notes in each time interval after the second dose (odds ratio7 days, 1.69 [1.58–
1.8]; odds ratio14 days, 1.92 [1.81–2.03]; odds ratio21 days, 2.08 [1.97–2.2]) (Table 2).
BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 are not associated with increased rates of
emergent clinical follow-up
It is important to determine whether the observed vaccine-associated increases in
clinical follow-up were due to acute or emergent events. To do so, we first
compared the number of emergency department (ED) visits and notes contributed
by each group in the 1, 7, 14, and 21 days after each vaccine dose. Individuals
receiving either BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 were not more likely to contribute at
least one ED note during these intervals (Tables S3 and S4). For example, within
7 days of the first dose, 567 of 51,795 (1.09%) individuals vaccinated with

We show the numbers and percent of individuals in each group who had at least one phenotype-containing EHR note within 7, 14, or 21 days of the actual or assigned first vaccination date. To assess the magnitude and significance of difference between the follow-up rates, the odds ratio (OR) and corresponding
95% CI are shown. With the null hypothesis that the OR falls between 0.91 and 1.1, a difference was
considered significant if the upper bound of the 95% CI was less than 0.91 or the lower bound of the
95% CI was greater than 1.1.

BNT162b2 contributed an ED note compared to 752 of 51,795 (1.45%) unvaccinated individuals (odds ratio, 0.75 [0.67-0.84]). In the same period, 238 of
16,471 (1.44%) individuals receiving mRNA-1273 had at least one ED note versus
219 of 16,471 (1.33%) unvaccinated individuals (odds ratio, 1.09 [0.90–1.31]) (Table
S3). These trends were similar within 7 days of the second dose for both BNT162b2
(odds ratio, 0.76 [0.66–0.87]) and mRNA-1273 (odds ratio, 1.14 [0.92–1.41]) (Table
S4). Consistent with this, the total number of ED notes contributed by vaccinated
individuals was similar or lower than the corresponding number contributed by
their unvaccinated controls in each interval for both BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273
(Tables S5 and S6).
Severe adverse effects are rare and observed at similar rates in vaccinated
individuals and unvaccinated controls
Severe adverse events have been rarely observed in individuals who previously
received COVID-19 vaccines, including anaphylaxis, facial paralysis, and cerebral
venous sinus thrombosis (CVST).22–24 We next performed augmented curation followed by manual review to identify occurrences of these events in the clinical notes
of all vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals within 7, 14, or 21 days of each actual
or assigned vaccine dose (see STAR Methods).
We did identify multiple instances of facial paralysis and anaphylaxis in these intervals, but these events were documented at similar or lower frequencies among individuals receiving BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 compared to each set of unvaccinated controls (Figures 2 and 3; Tables 3, 4, and S7–S10). This supports a recent
report showing that facial paralysis was not observed at disproportionately high
rates among individuals receiving BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 compared to individuals receiving influenza vaccines or other viral vaccines more broadly.25 While
there was one case of CVST identified within 14 days of an individual receiving
BNT162b2, there were several cases documented among the unvaccinated cohorts (Tables S7–S10). We have also previously shown that the rate of CVST is
similar in the 15 and 30 days prior to and after BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 vaccination in a large cohort at the Mayo Clinic.26 Taken together with the absence of an
increase in emergent clinical visits following each dose, these data suggest favorable tolerability of both vaccines.

We show the numbers and percent of individuals in each group who had at least one phenotype-containing EHR note within 7, 14, or 21 days of the actual or assigned second vaccination date. To assess the
magnitude and significance of difference between the follow-up rates, the OR and corresponding 95%

significant if the upper bound of the 95% CI was less than 0.91 or the lower bound of the 95% CI was

EHR documented frequencies of adverse effects are much lower than their
solicited frequencies reported in clinical trials
Among 51,732 individuals analyzed (Table S11), the most commonly documented
symptoms within 7 days of the first BNT162b2 dose included headache (522 individuals [1.01%]), fatigue (470 [0.91%]), myalgia (381 [0.74%]), arthralgia (360 [0.70%]),
nausea (332 [0.64%]), and erythema (273 [0.53%]) (Table 3). These same symptoms
were the most commonly documented within 7 days of the first mRNA-1273 dose
among the 16,455 analyzed individuals: fatigue (244 [1.48%]), headache (187
[1.14%]), arthralgia (188 [1.14%]), myalgia (165 [1.00%]), nausea (155 [0.94%]), and
erythema (124 [0.75%]) (Table 3). These were also the most frequently observed
symptoms within 7 days of the second dose for both BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273
(Table 4).
Notably, these rates of adverse effects documented in EHR notes were markedly
lower than the rates of adverse effects observed in clinical trials (e.g., fatigue
[63%–70%], myalgia [38%–62%], arthralgia [24%–46%], fever [14%–16%], and erythema [10%–15%]) and those captured in V-safe.4,5,15,27 This is to be expected, as
individuals vaccinated outside of the trial or post-marketing surveillance setting
are advised that it is normal to experience these adverse effects, and so they are
less likely to report them to a healthcare provider. As such, the vaccine-associated
adverse effects that are captured in EHR notes are likely to be those that are severe
or persistent enough to cause an individual to return to the clinic or otherwise notify
their healthcare provider.
Myalgia and arthralgia are documented more frequently in the EHR notes of
vaccinated individuals than unvaccinated controls
We next computed the incidence rate ratio (IRR) for each adverse effect between the
vaccinated and propensity-matched unvaccinated cohorts (Figure 1). Within 7 days
of the first dose, individuals receiving BNT162b2 were slightly more likely to have
reported myalgia (IRR, 1.3 [1.1–1.5]) and arthralgia (IRR, 1.4 [1.2–1.6]), while other
side effects were documented at similar rates between the cohorts (Figure 2; Table
3). This profile was similar for mRNA-1273, with only myalgia (IRR, 1.5 [1.2–1.9]) and
arthralgia (IRR, 1.8 [1.4–2.2]) documented at moderately higher rates among vaccinated individuals within 7 days of the first dose (Figure 2; Table 3). These symptoms

were also more frequently documented in the vaccinated cohorts in the 7 days
following the second dose (Figure 2; Table 4) and in the 14 and 21 days following
each dose (Figures 3A and 3B; Tables S7–S10). Other symptoms continued to
show similar or lower incidence rates in vaccinated individuals compared to unvaccinated controls in the 14 and 21 days following each dose (Figures 3A and 3B;
Tables S7–S10).

DISCUSSION
This study demonstrates that the two currently FDA-authorized mRNA COVID-19
vaccines, BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273, are safe and tolerated in practice. This
conclusion is consistent with the extensive safety and tolerability assessments conducted in phase 1/2 and 3 trials over the past year and the post-marketing surveillance efforts that are currently underway.4,5,15,28,29 Here, we assessed real-world
safety by longitudinally curating the EHR documentation of adverse effects in
68,266 individuals receiving at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine compared
to a propensity-matched unvaccinated cohort of the same size. Compared to this
control cohort, vaccinated individuals were more likely to be seen in the clinic, but
not in the ED, within 7, 14, or 21 days after the first or second vaccine dose. Myalgia
and arthralgia were documented more frequently in the EHR notes of individuals
who received BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 compared to their respective controls during each of these intervals, while the other surveyed symptoms were not. Importantly, severe events were rare and did not occur at unexpectedly high rates in either
vaccinated cohort.
The purpose of using propensity matching in this study was to establish an expected
frequency for each potential vaccine-associated adverse effect in a group of individuals with similar demographic, clinical, and geographic characteristics, akin to a placebo group in a randomized clinical trial. Our finding that EHR notes from vaccinated
and propensity-matched unvaccinated individuals record similar rates of potential
vaccine-associated adverse effects (other than myalgia and arthralgia) differs from
the data obtained in phase 3 trials, wherein vaccinated participants experienced
higher rates of several other symptoms than those receiving placebo. Further, the

absolute rates of adverse effects documented in these EHR notes are well below the
rates reported in clinical trials or the active post-marketing surveillance effort (Vsafe). In V-safe, the most frequently reported systemic adverse effects thus far
include headache (26%–47%), fatigue (31%–54%), and myalgia (19%–44%).27 These
discrepancies are likely attributable to differences in the populations analyzed and
the methodology of reporting symptoms.
Regarding the populations analyzed, it is important to realize that adverse effects
experienced by healthcare workers, who are likely overrepresented in the vaccinated
cohorts due to their inclusion in phase 1a of the vaccine rollout, are generally less
likely to be documented in EHR notes. At many institutions, healthcare workers
experiencing potential vaccine side effects are directed to follow up with Occupational Health Services, which is an entity of the employer and thus does not document the reported symptoms in EHR notes. Several institutions have also established
COVID-19 response lines, which will usually direct individuals experiencing nonspecific vaccine side effects toward self-care. Further, healthcare workers may be less
likely to report adverse effects at baseline given their clinical expertise and ability
to self-assess the severity of their illness.

For each adverse effect, incidence rates were calculated for the vaccinated and propensity-matched unvaccinated cohorts as the number of positive cases
divided by the total number of at-risk person-days during this time period. Individuals were considered at risk for developing an adverse effect from their actual
or assigned date of first vaccination until they experienced the event, died, or reached the end of the 7-day study period or until 4 days prior to a positive SARSCoV-2 test result. For example, we see that 470 cases of fatigue were recorded in the BNT162b2-vaccinated cohort over a total of 359,712 person-days, corresponding to an incidence rate of 1.3 cases per 1,000 person-days. N/A, not applicable; inf, infinity.

Regarding reporting methods, both trials included a 7-day post-vaccination period
in which symptoms were actively solicited from some or all individuals as well
as longer periods in which unsolicited adverse effects and serious adverse reactions were recorded from all individuals. V-safe similarly solicits adverse effect reports from its voluntary participants on a regular basis. Such methods that rely on
active solicitation can be prone to overestimating the true frequency of vaccineinduced side effects, as evidenced by the relatively high fraction of individuals reporting side effects after receiving placebo.4,5 In contrast, our methods rely exclusively on the recording of unsolicited symptoms or events in the EHR. Given that
individuals are warned of the likely vaccine-associated adverse effects at the
time of vaccination in the real-world setting, it is likely that most mild or moderate
symptoms are never actually reported and thus are not documented in an EHR
note.

For each adverse effect, incidence rates were calculated for the vaccinated and propensity-matched unvaccinated cohorts as the number of positive cases
divided by the total number of at-risk person-days during this time period. Individuals were considered at risk for developing an adverse effect from their actual
or assigned date of first vaccination until they experienced the event, died, or reached the end of the 7-day study period or until 4 days prior to a positive SARSCoV-2 test result. For example, we see that 321 cases of fatigue were recorded in the BNT162b2-vaccinated cohort over a total of 271,819 person-days, corresponding to an incidence rate of 1.2 cases per 1,000 person-days. N/A, not applicable; inf, infinity.

That said, serious safety concerns requiring medical care are indeed likely to be
documented in the EHR. For example, should an individual experience anaphylaxis, this individual will likely require emergent care, during which one or more
clinical notes will be written and will mention this phenotype. Thus, our method
should identify the symptoms and phenotypes that represent the most serious
threats to vaccine safety and tolerability of practical significance. Indeed, this is
the central reason why our analysis should be viewed as complementary to the
data that have been obtained in the more controlled setting of clinical trials. While
the observed adverse effect frequencies in the trial setting are extremely valuable,
our assessment specifically aims to describe the frequencies of adverse effects that
receive some form of clinical attention, as evidenced by their documentation in
the EHR.

974

Med 2, 965–978, August 13, 2021

ll
Clinical Advances
In light of this, it is worth noting that the rate of severe side effects was actually similar
among participants receiving vaccine or placebo in the Pfizer/BioNTech and
Moderna phase 3 trials at 2% or less, with the exception of severe fatigue in 3.8%
of participants after their second dose of BNT162b2.4,5 This is consistent with our
observations that vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals have similar EHR documentation rates for each surveyed potential vaccine-associated symptom. Our
finding that vaccinated individuals are not more likely to receive emergent care provides further orthogonal support for the safety of these vaccines.
As the remainder of the US population undergoes COVID-19 vaccination, it will
not be feasible to solicit reports of adverse effects from all vaccinated individuals.
It is important that clinicians are aware of VAERS as a centralized referral source
for the documentation of serious adverse effects experienced by patients after
vaccination and that patients are aware of the opportunity to enroll in voluntary
directed surveillance efforts like V-safe.15,30 Augmented curation of EHR notes
for real-world safety monitoring is a practical solution to this large-scale challenge
that can be deployed to complement these existing surveillance methods. The
method demonstrated here represents a scalable approach to continuously
monitor serious safety concerns associated with any authorized COVID-19 vaccine. Taken together with our recent study highlighting the real-world effectiveness of these vaccines, these data reinforce that individuals, providers, and public
health officials should proceed rapidly with vaccination efforts with high confidence in their safety.21
Limitations of study
There are a few limitations of this study. First, while the analysis was conducted on
a population derived from a large healthcare system, the cohort demographics are
not representative of the American population. For example, over 90% of individuals in each vaccinated and unvaccinated cohort were Caucasian, 60% of individuals who received BNT162b2 were female, and over 50% individuals who received
mRNA-1273 were age 65 years or older (Tables S1 and S2). These biases may limit
the generalizability of our study, as populations receiving the vaccines in later
phases of the rollout could exhibit or report distinct side effects profiles due to differences in underlying demographic or clinical characteristics. Related to this
point, the likely enrichment of healthcare workers in the vaccinated cohorts (due
to their inclusion in phase 1a of the rollout) likely leads to an underestimation of
the rates of return to clinic due to factors previously discussed, such as access
to an Occupational Health Services office and other institution-specific COVID19 response centers. Unfortunately, we are not able to extract healthcare worker
status or utilization of such resources from the EHR database to improve our propensity score matching or enable stratified analyses, but future studies investigating this bias are certainly warranted.
Second, the bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) model
used to curate EHR notes does not imply a direct link between COVID-19 vaccination
and the experience of a phenotype. That is, we simply capture the occurrence of an
adverse effect without ensuring that the clinical note indeed suggests or confirms
that vaccination caused the symptom. This shortcoming is addressed by comparing
vaccinated individuals to the unvaccinated control cohort, which establishes a baseline expected frequency for each symptom in the absence of vaccination. Finally,
while sentences suggesting the occurrence of anaphylaxis, facial paralysis, or
CVST were manually reviewed to confirm both the positive sentiment and the tense,
sentences for the other curated phenotypes were not reviewed. In the future, we will

train natural language processing models to discriminate past from present tense,
thereby circumventing this need for manual review.

EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS
Human subjects
The total cohort included 136,532 individuals. Each individual was part of one of the
following four cohorts, on the basis of whether they had or had not received at least
one dose of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine: (1) BNT162b2 vaccinated (n = 51,795 individuals), (2) BNT162b2 matched unvaccinated (n = 51,795 individuals), (3) mRNA1273 vaccinated (n = 16,471 individuals), or (4) mRNA-1273 matched unvaccinated
(n = 16,471 individuals). More details describing the participant selection algorithm
are provided in the method details and are illustrated in Figure 1. Demographic and

METHOD DETAILS
Study design, setting, and population
This is a retrospective study of individuals who underwent polymerase chain reaction
(PCR) testing for suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection at the Mayo Clinic and hospitals
affiliated with the Mayo Clinic Health System.
The cohorts of vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals considered for this study are
identical to the cohorts considered in a previous analysis: ‘‘FDA-authorized COVID19 vaccines are effective per real-world evidence synthesized across a multi-state
health system.’’21 In total, there were 572,291 individuals in the Mayo electronic
health record (EHR) database who received a PCR test between February 15, 2020
and February 8, 2021. To obtain the study population, we defined the following inclusion criteria: (1) at least 18 years old; (2) no positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test before
December 1, 2020; (3) resides in a locale (based on zip code) with at least 25 individuals who have received BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273; (4) has no record of receiving the
Johnson & Johnson (J&J) COVID-19 vaccine (Ad26.COV2.S). This population
included 324,992 individuals, of whom 86,184 have received BNT162b2 or mRNA1273 and 238,808 have no record of COVID-19 vaccination. Vaccinated individuals
who had tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by PCR between December 1, 2020 and the
date of their first vaccine dose were excluded, as were individuals with zero follow-up
days after vaccination (i.e., those who received the first vaccine dose on the last date
of data collection). Individuals who had received their second vaccine dose four or
more days earlier than recommended (17 or fewer days after the first dose for
BNT162b2; 24 or fewer days after the first dose for mRNA-1273) were also excluded,
leaving 85,676 eligible individuals for the final vaccinated cohort.
A propensity matched unvaccinated cohort was selected from the previously
derived set of 238,808 unvaccinated individuals. The purpose of this cohort was to
establish the baseline frequency of EHR documentation for each adverse effect of
interest in a cohort which is clinically similar to our vaccinated cohort. These baseline, or expected, frequencies can then be compared to the observed frequencies
to determine whether or not these adverse effects are reported at unexpectedly
high rates among patients receiving a COVID-19 vaccine. A detailed description
of the matching procedure is given in the related vaccine effectiveness manuscript.21
Briefly, for each vaccinated individual, we attempted to identify an unvaccinated individual who (i) resides in the same location (per zip code), (ii) is of the same sex, (iii)
has the same current status regarding long term care facility residence, and (iv) has a

similar propensity score accounting for age, race, ethnicity, and history of testing for
SARS-CoV-2 and influenza during the past year. Propensity scores were calculated
for all eligible individuals (both vaccinated and unvaccinated) by training a logistic
regression model to predict vaccination status using the statsmodels v0.10.0 package in Python.31
We were able to identify valid matches for 68,266 of the 85,676 eligible vaccinated
individuals. Thus, our final overall vaccinated and unvaccinated cohorts each contained 68,266 individuals (n = 51,795 each for BNT162b2, and n = 16,471 each for
mRNA-1273). Demographic and clinical characteristics of these cohorts are provided in Tables S1 and S2, and the age distributions of the cohorts before and after
matching are shown in Figure S1; note that these tables and this figure are identical
to those in the related manuscript that utilizes the same cohorts.21 Of the 51,795 individuals who received at least one dose of BNT162b2, 39,058 received two doses;
of the 16,471 individuals who received at least one dose of mRNA-1273, 11,851
received two doses. The distribution of time between doses for BNT162b2 and
mRNA-1273 is shown in Figure S2, which is also duplicated from the previous manuscript.21 The selection algorithm and its associated counts are summarized in Figure 1, and additional cohort characterization details can be found in the related
manuscript.21
Definition of time intervals for safety analyses
For each vaccinated individual, we defined the date of their first vaccine dose as Day
V1 and the date of their second vaccine dose as Day V2. In the results section, these
are referred to as ‘‘actual’’ dates of vaccination. For each unvaccinated individual,
Day V1 and Day V2 were designated as identical to their matched vaccinated individual. In the results section, these are referred to as ‘‘assigned’’ dates of vaccination.
Definition of adverse effects of interest
The adverse effects considered were primarily derived from those assessed in phase
3 trials of BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273, including fatigue, fever, chills, myalgia,
arthralgia, headache, lymphadenopathy, erythema, diarrhea, vomiting, and local
pain and swelling.4,5 We also included anaphylaxis, facial paralysis (Bell’s palsy),
and cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST), as these rare events have been reported in individuals receiving COVID-19 vaccines as well. Each adverse effect
was mapped to a set of synonyms intended to capture the various ways that a given
phenotype could be referenced in the context of a clinical note.
Curation of adverse effects from clinical notes
To curate the adverse effects experienced by each patient from the electronic health
record, we used a BERT-based neural network model to classify the sentiment for the
phenotypes (described above) mentioned in the clinical notes.32 Specifically, this
classification model categorizes phenotype-containing sentences into one of four
categories: (1) confirmed diagnosis (2) ruled-out diagnosis, (3) possibility of disease,
and (4) alternate context (e.g., family history). This classification model was trained
on 18,500 sentences and has shown an out-of-sample accuracy of 93.6% with precision and recall scores above 95%.33
Here we performed curation on a total of 1,279,292 EHR notes, including 650,137
contributed by vaccinated individuals and 629,155 contributed by unvaccinated individuals. These notes document clinical interactions on the full spectrum of acuity
from routine (e.g., pre-scheduled) appointments to emergency department (ED)
visits; approximately 3% of the notes analyzed were derived from ED visits. The

Med 2, 965–978.e1–e5, August 13, 2021

e3

ll
Clinical Advances
EHR also captures both in-person and telehealth interactions, which is relevant given
the increased frequency of remote patient-provider interactions during the COVID19 pandemic.
For each individual, we applied the sentiment model to the clinical notes in the Mayo
Clinic electronic health record during our defined intervals of interest for each individual: (1) Day V1 to 7, 14, or 21 days after Day V1, and (3) Day V2 to 7, 14, or 21 days
after Day V2. For each phenotype, we identified the first date on which the given individual had at least one sentence in which the phenotype was categorized as
‘‘confirmed diagnosis’’ with a confidence score of at least 90%. For the severe phenotypes of anaphylaxis, facial paralysis, and cerebral venous sinus thrombosis
(CVST), each such sentence was manually reviewed to verify the positive sentiment
(i.e., confirmed diagnosis) and to assess the tense of this sentiment (i.e., past versus
present). Only sentences manually confirmed as a present diagnosis were used to
count these severe events.

QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Evaluating rates of return to clinic, including emergent visits, after vaccination
To evaluate the likelihood of returning to the clinic after vaccination, we counted the
number of individuals who had at least one clinical note in the 7, 14, and 21 days after
Day V1 and Day V2 (Data S1 and S2). The fraction of individuals with clinical follow-up
was calculated as the number of individuals with at least one clinical note in the time window divided by the total number of individuals in each group (for BNT162b2: nDose 1 =
51,795; nDose 2 = 39,058; for mRNA-1273: nDose 1 = 16,471; nDose 2 = 11,851). The difference in clinical follow-up rates was assessed by calculating the odds ratio (OR) along
with its corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI). The null hypothesis was that the OR
falls between 0.91 and 1.1 (i.e., the larger rate is at most 10% larger than the smaller
rate); thus, an OR was considered significant if the upper bound of the 95% CI was
less than 0.91 or the lower bound of the 95% CI was greater than 1.1.
To evaluate emergent clinical follow-up, we compared the number and percentage
of vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals who contributed at least one ED note in
the 1, 7, 14, or 21 days after each actual or assigned vaccine administration date
(Data S1 and S2). The odds ratio and corresponding 95% CI were calculated for
each time window, with the null hypothesis stating that the OR falls between 0.91
and 1.1 (as above). We also determined the total number of ED notes from vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals in these same time windows, along with the fraction of ED notes relative to all clinical notes (Data S1 and S2). The difference in the
fraction of ED notes was assessed by computing an odds ratio and corresponding
95% CI, with the null hypothesis stating that the OR falls between 0.91 and 1.1.
ED notes included those under the following categories in the EHR system: ED
Notes, ED Procedure Note, ED Provider Notes, ED Provider Triage Note, ED Reevaluation Note, and ED Triage Notes.
All odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were calculated using the fisher.test
function from the stats package in R (version 4.0.3).34 These analyses were performed in RStudio (version 1.3.959).35 Code corresponding to these analyses are
provided in Data S3.
Evaluating rates of adverse effects between vaccinated and matched
unvaccinated cohorts
To evaluate adverse effects associated with receiving a COVID-19 vaccine in the clinical setting, we compared the vaccinated and matched unvaccinated populations

e4

Med 2, 965–978.e1–e5, August 13, 2021

ll
Clinical Advances
described above and summarized in Figure 1. Specifically, we compared (i) 51,795
individuals with follow-up who received at least one dose of BNT162b2 to 51,795
matched individuals who have never received a COVID-19 vaccine, and (ii) 16,471
individuals with follow-up who received at least one dose of mRNA-1273 to
16,471 matched individuals who have never received a COVID-19 vaccine.
The incidence of a given adverse effect after each vaccine dose was assessed by
computing the incidence rate ratio (IRR) of the vaccinated and unvaccinated cohorts.
Specifically, we evaluated adverse effects which were documented in clinical notes
within 7 days of receiving the first vaccine dose (Day V1 to 7 days after Day V1) or
the second vaccine dose (Day V2 to 7 days after Day V2). For each cohort in a defined
time period, incidence rates were calculated as the number of individuals experiencing the given adverse effect in that time period divided by the total number of
at risk person-days contributed in that time period. The IRR was calculated as the
incidence rate of the vaccinated cohort divided by the incidence rate of the unvaccinated cohort, and its 95% CI was computed using an exact approach described
previously.36 The IRR was considered to be statistically significant if the 95% CI
did not include 1. This process was repeated to evaluate adverse effects which
were documented in clinical notes within 14 or 21 days of the first or second vaccine
dose.
For each individual, at-risk person-days are defined as the number of days from the
start of the time period to the day on which the individual experienced the adverse
effect or died, or four days prior to testing positive for SARS-CoV-2. This four day
buffer was included to reduce the likelihood of mistaking early COVID-19 symptoms
for vaccine side effects. Because some infections occurred within 4 days of either
dose and because the rate of infection differed between the vaccinated and unvaccinated groups, the cohorts from which incidence rates were calculated differ slightly
from the total cohorts of vaccinated and unvaccinated patients described above.
The sizes of the cohorts considered in these analyses are provided in Table S3,
and code corresponding to these analyses are provided in Data S4.
