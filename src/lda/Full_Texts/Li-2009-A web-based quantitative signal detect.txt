Abstract
Objective To establish a web-based quantitative signal
detection system for adverse drug reactions (ADRs) based
on spontaneous reporting to the Guangdong province drugmonitoring database in China.
Methods Using Microsoft Visual Basic and Active Server
Pages programming languages and SQL Server 2000, a
web-based system with three software modules was
programmed to perform data preparation and association
detection, and to generate reports. Information component
(IC), the internationally recognized measure of disproportionality for quantitative signal detection, was integrated
into the system, and its capacity for signal detection was
tested with ADR reports collected from 1 January 2002 to
30 June 2007 in Guangdong.
Results A total of 2,496 associations including known
signals were mined from the test database. Signals (e.g.,
cefradine-induced hematuria) were found early by using the

Introduction
Limited information concerning possible adverse drug
reactions (ADRs) is available at the time of marketing. In
recent decades, spontaneous reporting systems (SRSs),
which are used to monitor the safety of drugs after
marketing, have earned a reputation for offering a fast and
reasonably efficient way to detect ADRs [1]. Manual
review of all reports from SRSs is time consuming and
difficult when attempting to establish more complex
associations among patient characteristics, reported ADRs,
and suspected drugs. In the last 10 years, several
approaches have been developed and implemented to
provide additional information concerning a possible
relationship between a suspected ADR and a drug, such
as proportional ADR reporting ratio (PRR) used by the
Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency,
reporting odds ratio (ROR) used by the Netherlands
Pharmacovigilance Foundation Lareb, Bayesian confidence
propagation neural network (BCPNN) used by the WHO
Collaborating Centre for International Drug Monitoring
(the Uppsala Monitoring Centre), multi-item gamma-

Poisson shrinker, Yule’s Q test, Poisson probability, and
chi-square tests [2-9].
Approaches for signal detection from SRS have been
developed and implemented quickly in other countries.
The Guangdong ADR spontaneous reporting system was
set up in 2001. The database of ADRs set up by the
Guangdong Monitoring Centre covers the 21 cities in
Guangdong province with a population over 82.9 million
and contains 41,596 qualified reports from the beginning
of 2002 through 30 June 2007. The database includes
many events of multiple drugs and multiple reactions. It
is a large database now, and about 3,000-5,000 new
reports are added quarterly [10]. The task of trying to find
new drug-ADR signals has been carried out by a committee
of experts, but with such a large volume of material, the
task is daunting. Automated quantitative signal detection
systems, which can easily detect complex associations
between the reported ADRs and suspected drugs, is
urgently needed in Guangdong.

BCPNN Method
Although the various approaches differ from each other in
their principles and methodology, they all share the same
characteristic that they search the databases for disproportionality [9]. The statistical measures of disproportionality
all express the extent to which the reported ADR is
associated with the suspected drug compared with the other
drugs in the database. The occurrence of ADRs related to
other drugs in the database is used as a proxy for the
background incidence of ADRs. Table 1 shows the 2×2
contingency table for calculating disproportionality [1]. N
is the total number of records in the database, A is the
number of combinations between a specific drug (i) and a
suspected ADR (j), A+B is the total number of records on
the suspected drug (i) in the database, and A+C is the total
number of records on the suspected ADR (j) in the database.
BCPNN is a statistical neural network where the nodes
correspond to different events and the weights between

nodes are proportional to the strength of association
between different events. For the purpose of dependency
derivation, only the weights between nodes in the network
(referred to as information components or IC values) are of
interest [11]. These can be estimated directly from data, so
for transparency we shall refer to the use of the BCPNN for
Bayesian dependency derivation as IC analysis throughout
this article.
For quantitative signal detection, no true gold standard is
available; IC analysis was selected for use with the
Guangdong database for the following reasons. Firstly, this
approach yielded a positive predictive value of 44% and a
negative predictive value of 85% in the detection of signals
as compared with reference literature sources when used for
analyzing the WHO database [9, 12, 13]. Secondly, in
contrast to other measures, such as ROR and PRR, both the
point estimate and its confidence interval can be calculated
under all circumstances [9, 12, 13]. Furthermore, we had
examined the concordance of various measures with the IC
measure based on the database of Guangdong province
[10]. Finally, we had constructed a spontaneous reporting
system model considering several factors, such as frequency of exposure, time to market, the background incidence
of adverse events, the severity of ADR as well as the
reporting probability to compare various signal detection
methods based on a simulation database by using SAS
software. The results showed that the sensitivity and
specificity of the IC measure were acceptable, the area
under the receiver-operating-characteristic curve (AUC)
was 0.87, and the evaluation indexes increased when the
number of reports per combination increased.
IC and IC−2SD (i.e., IC minus two standard deviations)
were calculated in the IC analysis for all drug-ADR
combinations in the Guangdong database [9, 14]. A
negative association in the Guangdong quantitative signal
detection system was defined as IC-2SD≤0 [5]. A weak
association was defined as 0<IC-2SD≤1.5, a medium
association as 1.5<IC-2SD≤3.0, and a strong association
as IC-2SD>3.0 [15]. Association refers to drug-ADR
combinations with positive IC-2SD values, based on the
calculation of the measure of disproportionality. “Signal
detection” relates to the entire process of detecting a signal
including manual clinical review.

System overview
The Guangdong quantitative signal detection system
(GDQSDS), a web-based system comprising three software
modules that prepare data, detect associations, and generate
reports, was developed based on the Guangdong ADR
monitoring platform. GDQSDS was coded with Microsoft
Visual Basic and Active Server Pages programming

Eur J Clin Pharmacol (2009) 65:729–741

731

languages and programmed to carry out the IC analysis. All
datasets were managed with a Microsoft SQL Server
database.
GDQSDS runs on two separate servers using the
Windows 2000 Server operating system. One is the World
Wide Web (WWW) server running Internet Information
Services. WWW users with different privileges, such as
regulatory agencies, boards of experts, provincial users,
manufacturers, and medical and health institutions, log on
through the Secure Socket Layer and use the three modules
of GDQSDS. The other server is the database server
running SQL Server 2000, which can not be accessed from
the Internet [16].
GDQSDS has large computational power to consider all
possible links in the database and can automatically process
the association detection procedures and output significant
pharmacovigilance associations quarterly based on all drugADR combinations in the database. A total of 71 different
fields, such as patient characteristics, generic drug name,
ADR, drug category, and ADR category are included in the
Guangdong ADR database. Searches can be performed for
a specific condition, for a specific drug or ADR, or for
subdatasets.
Figure 1 is the flowchart describing the signal detection
system of Guangdong. All computer programs for data
preparation (statistical description, data cleaning and coding, and data disintegration), association detection (data
extraction and calculation), and report generation are
integrated into the platform.
Statistical description
A total of 20,962 reports in males and 20,652 reports in
females were collected in Guangdong (in 5 cases the gender
variable was missing). The 19-29 and 30-39 age groups
were most commonly found. The reports included 36,283
general ADR reports (87.18%), 3,818 (9.17%) new ADRs,

(ADRadverse drug reaction)

Data Preparation

1,230 (2.96%) serious ADRs, and 288 (0.69%) new serious
ADRs. The frequency of ADRs suffered after intravenous
injection was 1.47 times, which is higher than the average
of 1.36 times. Half of the 10 drugs most frequently
reported (i.e., ceftriaxone sodium, glucose, cefoperazone
sodium, sulbactam sodium, azithromycin, ceftazidime,
penicillin G, cefuroxime sodium, levofloxacin hydrochloride, cefotaxime sodium, fleroxacin) were cephalosporins.
A total of 2,835 ADRs were related to ceftriaxone sodium.
Rash, anaphylactoid reaction, and rigors were the most
frequently reported adverse reactions in the database.
Report characteristics showed no clinical significant difference between doctor and pharmacist report groups.
The generic drug name or ADR name was incorrectly
reported and could not be determined from the case
description in 23 cases, so these cases were excluded from
signal detection. Ultimately, 41,596 reports were collected
during 1 January 2002 and 30 June 2007 in Guangdong
Monitoring Centre.
Data cleaning and coding
In the Guangdong ADR monitoring database, some
unusual, colloquial, and misspelled drug names and ADR
names were found. For example, cefradine was recorded as
cefradine, cefradine capsule, cefradine injection, and 53
other Chinese names. Leucopenia was recorded as leucopenia, white blood cell decrease, WBC decrease, white C
decrease, and 22 other Chinese names. Data cleaning and
coding of the drugs and ADRs should be done at the very
beginning.
Generic names for drug records were standardized based
on a combination of New Pharmacology (15th ed, Chinese)
[17] and MCDEX Clinical Drug Reference (2006, Chinese)
[18] and the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC)
classification was used as a reference for Western medicine.
Generic drug names were used for the “drug of interest” in

GDQSDS. Brand names were also considered in our
generalized system. If one brand of a drug is linked to
several reports in a short time, experts will pay more
attention to this brand drug. ADR names were normalized
using a combination of the WHO Adverse Reaction
Terminology (Chinese) [19] and International Classification
of Diseases, 10th revision (Chinese) [20].
The specific process for drug name standardization was
as follows. (The process for ADR standardization was the
same.) Firstly, we searched using a particular nonstandard
drug name. Secondly, we renamed this drug based on
standardization terminologies and added it to corresponding
drug category. Thirdly, in the future, the same nonstandard
drug names will be renamed too by automatic computer
matching. The nonstandard drug name database, nonstandard ADR name database, standard drug name database,
and standard ADR term (PT level) database were stored in
the system. Through 30 June 2007, 5,407 rules for
standardizing generic drug names and 4,031 standard drug
names were created. A total of 8,715 rules for standardizing
ADR names and 2,332 standard names of ADR were
established. The rule databases were capable of completing
80% of the standardization work for the new cases. Only
20% of the reports needed to be standardized manually. In
the future, we will train the reporters to report ADR using
standardization databases.

conducted as follows. Firstly, the records database can be
searched by entering 2002 to 2004 in the “date-received
field.” N is the total number of records in the selected
database. Secondly, by searching the “generic name field”
for cefradine and the “ADR term field” for hematuria, we
can obtain the value for A. Calculations of B, C, and D
occur similarly to those of N and A. Finally the IC values
of the combination can be produced.
In terms of the hierarchies in the dictionaries used, four
types of signal detection including detection for “single
drug-single ADR,” “single drug-ADR category,” “drug
category-single ADR,” and “drug category-ADR category”
combinations were constructed in GDQSDS. This yields
four types of signal detection, for example, “cefradineinduced hematuria,” “cefradine-induced urinary-system
disorders,” “cephalosporin-induced hematuria,” and
“cephalosporin-induced urinary-system disorders.” Single
ADR refers to the preferred term (PT) level of WHOART, and the ADR category refers approximately to the
higher level group term of WHO-ART. “Single drugsingle ADR” signal detection is carried out at the level
of specific drug and preferred term, and it is the most
important. At the same time, other types of signal
detection can also be an extremely useful.

Data disintegration

All results of association detection will be shown in
tabular format on the user interface. For medium or
strong associations, an additional table will be provided,
and a corresponding graph of dynamic IC values will be
shown. If a particular combination always presents a
medium or strong association over the course of 1 year,
the user will be alerted by a pop-up dialog box. The
automatic warning list is cumulative. On the user
interface of the associations warning list, warned associations can be browsed and these warned associations are
stored in the system by quarter.
Online assessments based on the known ADR database
can be performed by experts, and the final signals should be
evaluated by follow-up study. The database of known
ADRs is compiled in Guangdong and includes known
ADRs announced by regulatory agencies, listed in drug
instructions, described in the literature, etc. Files containing
information about known ADRs such as DOC or PDF files
can be uploaded by users and need to be confirmed by
experts and can then be stored in the system. Thus far,
8,055 drug instructions have been stored in the database,
and the database is continuously expanding.
User interfaces for logging in, association detection,
dynamic IC values, and quarterly automatic warning have
been developed for the quantitative signal detection system
and are given in the “Appendix.”

Reports sent to the SRS contain information about one or
more (suspected) drugs and one or more suspected ADRs.
For example, case A may have taken two suspected drugs
and suffered three adverse reactions such as hematuria,
leucopenia, and nausea. In that situation, this case will be
disintegrated and the one report will be transformed into six
records. In this way, 62,196 records were obtained from
41,596 reports. The reports database and disintegrated
records database were both stored in the system. The
disintegrated records can be linked back to the reports with
a key field, the ID number. All calculations for signal
detection in this article were performed based on 62,196
records.
Association detection
Subdatabases for analysis can be created by searching drugrelated or ADR-related items such as generic name, ADR
term, and date-received fields. Because the IC algorithm
was programmed into the computer system, the A, B, C, D,
N, and IC values can be calculated automatically by
running SQL languages, and these results will be shown
in tabular format. For example, the search for “cefradineinduced hematuria” collected from 2002 to 2004 would be

Several different target audiences with different levels
of authority can browse different interfaces. For regulatory agencies (State or Guangdong Food and Drug
Administration), the board of experts and the provincial
users have the highest authority to browse all the signal
detection system including all reports; all positive
associations (IC-2SD>0); the weak, medium or strong
associations lists; and the automatic early warning list.
Only the board of experts can evaluate the detected
associations according to IC values, case-specific information, clinical experience, and the literatures. Regulatory agencies can make some decisions. Reporters such as
manufacturers, medical and health institutions, individuals, and family-planning agencies have limited authority.
They can browse and edit some data reported by them
before it is confirmed, and they can browse the automatic
warning list, experts’ evaluations, and regulatory agencies’ decisions. All users can download different user

of weak, medium, and strong associations), which accounts
for 27.59% of the total combinations (2,496/9,046).
Of the 3,662 combinations for “single drug-single
ADR,” 1,062 combinations were associations, and 28 were
strong associations including “cefradine-induced hematuria”, “captopril-induced coughing”, and other known
signals. For the “cefradine-induced hematuria” combination, the changes in association scores from 2004 to 2007
are shown in Table 4 and Fig. 2. The IC is listed or plotted
at quarterly intervals with confidence limits shown automatically from GDQSDS. As shown in Table 4 and Fig. 2,
the signal for cefradine-induced hematuria was found in the
first quarter of 2004. Zero records for the cefradinehematuria combination had been collected before 2004.
The number of records for the combination collected from
the beginning of 2004 to the second quarter of 2007 is up to
85. The IC value has increased steadily from 2.07 to 4.63
from 2004 to 2007. The confidence interval (4.28, 4.98) for
the second quarter of 2007 is narrower than that for the first
quarter of 2004 (0.63, 3.51).

In the automatic warning module, all the warning

Results of signal detection
The board of experts evaluated all 2,496 detected
associations, especially the 291 drug-ADR associations
that were first alerted in the second quarter of 2007.
Sixteen associations were recommended for further
study. Three safety-assessment cohort studies based on
signal tests about Qingkailing, Danshen and Xiangdan
injections were undertaken voluntarily by the pharmaceutical companies and carried out in Guangdong
starting in 2007.
Traditional and herbal drugs are popular in China.
ADRs induced by these drugs are more often found in
Chinese databases. A total of 7,055 ADR reports (7,055/

41,596=16.96%) related to Chinese traditional and herbal
drugs were collected from the beginning of 2002 to 30
June 2007 in Guangdong. Thus signal detection and
statistical descriptive analysis in China could be used as
a reference for traditional Chinese medicine in other
countries.

Discussion
The IC analysis with some changes was applied in the
GDQSDS according to the characteristics of the Chinese
ADR database. For example, data disintegration, data
coding and some criteria were established based on

Chinese characteristics. Because signal detection is the
first step in Guangdong database, only simple drug-ADR
combinations were analyzed. However, if a certain ADR
occurs more often than expected when two drugs are
used concomitantly, this may indicate the existence of a
drug-drug interaction. In the next step of our research,
quantitative signal generation can be used to study more
complex relationships, such as drug-drug interactions and
drug-related syndromes. Techniques for the detection of
drug interactions and syndromes offer a new challenge
for pharmacovigilance in Guangdong.
Due to the “spontaneous” character of the reporting,
the SRS method has some limitations. The most

noticeable problem is underreporting. Since not all
ADRs are reported, the data set of an SRS does not
necessarily constitute a valid representation of the ADRs
occurring in daily practice [1]. Although “intensive
monitoring” (e.g., intensive monitoring for gatifloxacin)
is available for the detection of ADRs of marketed drugs
in Guangdong, SRS is still an important method for postmarketing surveillance. Guangdong SRS has its own
unique characteristics [10], so the adaptability of the IC
method needs to be confirmed.
Half of the top-reported drugs were cephalosporins. A
greater number of reports doesn’t necessarily mean a greater
ADR incidence. The ADR incidence is the number of

ADRAdverse drug reaction, ICinformation component, IC_LLlower limit of confidence interval of IC (IC−2SD), IC_ULupper limit of
confidence interval of IC (IC+2SD). A represents the number of records in which the specific combination of the drug and suspected ADR was
mentioned

736

subjects experiencing the ADR divided by the total
number of subjects at risk. Cephalosporins may have
induced more ADR reports for three reasons. Firstly,
cephalosporin drugs are prone to induce rash and other
anaphylactic reactions. Secondly, antibiotics abuse is a
big problem in China. Higher levels of cephalosporin
administration (i.e., higher frequency of cephalosporin
drug exposure) resulted in higher levels of reactions
reported. Thirdly, a higher probability of ADR reporting
(or lower underreporting coefficient) for cephalosporins is
a factor too. More and more attention has been paid to
the problem of antibiotics abuse. Mathematical tools
based on disproportionality will generate many associations from the large spontaneous ADR database, so the
sensitivity and specificity of the IC method based on
Guangdong database need to be confirmed.
There is currently no gold standard that establishes
universal thresholds for statistical signals. The various
measures that are being applied in quantitative signal
detection in various national centers are comparable
when four or more reports constitute the drug-ADR
combination [9]. Because one or two cases have no
significance in signal detection, the IC was applied to
detect signals in the Guangdong database from drug-ADR
combinations in which the number of records per
combination is more than two. Two is a temporary
threshold of “interest” but not a clinical one. Further
practical experience and formal validation studies are
necessary to assess what thresholds should be applied
routinely in the quantitative signal detection system.
In GDQSDS, a negative association was defined as
IC-2SD≤0, a weak association as 0<IC-2SD≤1.5, a
medium association as 1.5<IC-2SD≤3.0, and a strong
association as IC-2SD>3.0. If one combination always
presents a medium or strong association over 1 year, an
alert will be generated. The risk of using these criteria is
delayed detection of emerging issues. So we considered
two ways to reduce the risk. First, if several ADR reports
are collected from the same medical institution or the
same district in a very short time, we will alert it, and
call it an intensive event. Second, these criteria will be
updated according to the numbers of associations and
based on future research. The time of discovery is not
only dependent on the measure used but also on the
criteria chosen for alerting, and the time frame of interest
is really when the IC starts to increase. For these
reasons, we will advise the board of experts to evaluate
reports with the IC analysis tool in a timely manner and
consider revising our criteria for general users, for

Eur J Clin Pharmacol (2009) 65:729–741

example, by changing the criterion Ato ≥3 or automatically computing the IC each month instead of each
quarter.
Several different target audiences with different levels
of authority can be logged into the signal detection system.
How great the level of authority should be for the different
users needs to be confirmed through use.
Bayes’s theorem expresses the relationship between the
probability of a proposition before (prior) and after
(posterior) the acquisition of additional data [1]. The results
of the quantitative approach should be considered as
additional information and be interpreted in combination
with clinical information, findings reported in the literature,
and other sources. Following this reasoning, it can be stated
that an association may not indicate a true signal. Signal
analysis and interpretation including via cohort study are
still decisive in the signal detection process.

Conclusion
Although statistical analysis of SRS data sets is not the
only method used in the signal detection process, it is
currently gaining ground and is the most convenient way
to mine large databases. GDQSDS, the computerized
web-based system built on Guangdong’s ADR database,
is fast and offers a more standardized statistical signal
detection tool. The system has three modules that support
timely detection of four types of signals for marketed
products; allow easy detection of changes in association
scores; and prioritize, track, and document signals. A
total of 5,407 rules for standardizing generic drug names
and 8,715 rules for standardizing ADR names allow
automatic completion of the standardization work of new
cases by matching, which is a very important part of the
signal detection process.
The IC measure was integrated into the system for the
detection of associations from the database of drug
monitoring in Guangdong and can be an extremely
useful adjunct to the expert assessment of very large
numbers of spontaneously reported ADRs. This webbased computerized quantitative signal detection system
to mine ADR reports was established in China for the
first time, and it can greatly enhance the efficiency of
ADR monitoring and find new drug-ADR signals and
outstanding safety problems. Quantitative signal detection
systems will play a greater role in pharmacovigilance in
China in the future based on a national regulatory
database.

Appendix
This appendix presents the web-based interfaces for
logging in, association detection, dynamic IC values,
and quarterly automatic warnings (images are screen
prints or Chinese-to-English representational diagrams).
Figure 3 shows the log in interface. Different users can
log in to the system using passwords.
Figure 4 is the user interface for the quantitative
signal detection system in Guangdong (GDQSDS). On
the left of Fig. 4b is the system menu. The “system
setting” function is used to allocate different users with
different privileges. “ADR tables” can perform statisti-

cal descriptions and export different statistical tables
according to different requirements. Data coding, rules
database, data audit, etc., are included in “ADR
information management.” Drug instructions and known
ADRs are stored in “Knowledge databases.” In addition, there are six buttons for the four types of
association detection, the medium or strong associations
list, and the quarterly automatic warnings on the
Systems menu. On the right side of Fig. 4b is the
display interface. For association detection, on the upper
part of the display interface, there are four textboxes
(generic name, ADR, and the range for date received)
and two buttons (search and export). Under these
buttons is the output window, and related tables or
graphs will be shown in this window.
Figure 5 is the dynamic IC values interface. On the left
of this interface is the System menu. An output window is
on the right, which displays the IC values in graphic and
tabular format at the same time.
