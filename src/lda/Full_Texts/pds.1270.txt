SUMMARY
Purpose To study the association between alopecia and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) by estimating
reporting rates and by making association comparisons within databases of adverse drug reactions (ADRs).
Methods All reports of alopecia with marketed SSRIs until the end of 2004 were identiﬁed in SWEDIS, the national
Swedish database for spontaneously reported ADRs, and in Vigibase, the international ADR database of the World Health
Organization. Total SSRI sales volumes in Sweden until the end of 2004 were obtained from the National Corporation of
Swedish Pharmacies. The Bayes’ Conﬁdence Propagation Neural Network (BCPNN) method was used to estimate
associations between alopecia and each of the SSRIs within the two databases.
Results A total of 27 reports of alopecia were identiﬁed in SWEDIS. As two reports concerned the use of two SSRIs, there
was a total of 29 drug-ADR combinations. All except three reports concerned women (88.9%). The reporting rate of alopecia
in Sweden was signiﬁcantly higher with sertraline compared with citalopram; 20.1 (95%CI 10.7–34.4) reports per million
patient-years versus 4.5 (95%CI 1.8–9.3) reports per million patient-years. No signiﬁcant differences in reporting rates were
noted for the remaining SSRIs. Sertraline also showed a statistically signiﬁcant association with alopecia in both SWEDIS
and Vigibase. Citalopram was signiﬁcantly associated with alopecia in Vigibase, but not in SWEDIS. No statistically
signiﬁcant associations were found for any of the other SSRIs.
Conclusions Alopecia appears to be a rare ADR to SSRIs. The risk of alopecia seems to vary between the different SSRIs,
and might be higher in women than in men. Copyright # 2006 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

INTRODUCTION
Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are
widely prescribed antidepressants. All SSRIs have
occasionally been associated with alopecia or hair

loss.1,2 It is believed that most drug-induced alopecia
is due to the conversion of growing hair follicles into
resting hair follicles.1,2 Then, shedding of the hair
shaft takes place up to 3 months after the initial insult.2
The term alopecia is considered to encompass all
forms of hair loss ranging from simple deﬂuvium to
total loss of body hair. Thinning of the hair is difﬁcult
to detect clinically until about 25–50% of the hairs on
the scalp are lost.2 Hair loss is, therefore, often a

subjective complaint by the patient, who notices an
increased loss of hair when brushing or washing the
hair.
The aim of this study was to identify all cases of
alopecia associated with SSRIs, which had been
reported to the Swedish Adverse Drug Reactions
Advisory Committee (SADRAC) and to estimate
reporting incidences in relation to sales data. A further
aim was to compare the association between alopecia
and each of the currently available SSRIs in
SADRAC’s database for adverse drug reactions
(ADRs), SWEDIS (Swedish Drug Information System) and in the international ADR database of the
World Health Organization (WHO), Vigibase.
METHODS
Since 1965, Sweden has a system for spontaneous
reporting of ADRs. All reports are stored in the
database SWEDIS. Reporting is compulsory for all
suspected new or serious adverse reactions. The
database SWEDIS now contains around 90 000 ADR
reports. The international ADR database of the WHO
was set up in 1968. Summary clinical reports are
currently received from 75 countries world-wide, and
the database Vigibase now contains over 3.1 million
ADR reports. All reports of suspected alopecia
associated with treatment with SSRIs until the end of
2004 in these two databases were included in the study.
In Sweden, all drugs are distributed centrally
through the National Corporation of Swedish Pharmacies (Apoteket AB), which is also responsible for
the routine collection of sales data. Annual sales data
can be presented as for example, the number of deﬁned
daily doses (DDDs) sold, which can be translated into
patient-years by dividing the number of DDDs sold
by 365.25. A DDD is the assumed average daily dose
of a drug for its main indication. For citalopram,
paroxetine and ﬂuoxetine the DDD is 20 mg, for
sertraline 50 mg, for ﬂuvoxamine 100 mg and for
escitalopram 10 mg. Fluvoxamine was approved in
Sweden in 1990, paroxetine in 1991, citalopram in
1992, ﬂuoxetine and sertraline in 1995 and escitalopram
in 2001. The poisson distribution was used for the
calculation of conﬁdence intervals around reporting
incidences. We deﬁned statistically signiﬁcant differences in reporting incidences as reporting incidences
with non-overlapping 95% CI (conﬁdence intervals).
The association between alopecia and each of the
SSRIs was estimated by use of the Bayesian
Conﬁdence Propagation Neural Network (BCPNN)
method as described previously.3,4 In short, the
method is based on Bayes’ theorem, and calculates

dependencies between drugs and ADRs within the
database. The measure of disproportionality is called
the information component (IC). The IC is based on
the following information: the number of reports
with the speciﬁc drug-ADR combination, the number
of reports with the speciﬁc drug, the number of reports
with the speciﬁc ADR, and the total number of reports
in the database. A positive IC value indicates that the
ADR is more often found among ADR reports to the
drug compared with what would have been expected if
the drug and the ADR were independent from each
other in the database. The IC value is calculated with
standard deviations (SD), where 2 SD corresponds
to the 95% conﬁdence limits. A statistically signiﬁcant
positive association is deﬁned as a positive IC value in
combination with a positive IC 2 SD value, that is,
when the IC value and its entire 95%CI are above zero.
Observed differences between two IC values were
deﬁned as statistically signiﬁcant when the respective
95%CIs were non-overlapping.
RESULTS
A total of 27 reports of alopecia associated with SSRI
treatment were identiﬁed in SWEDIS (Table 1). One
patient experienced alopecia with two different SSRIs
at separate occasions whereas one patient developed
alopecia when treated with two SSRIs concomitantly.
Thus, the number of suspected drugs in these reports
amounts to 29. Cumulative sales data of all available
SSRIs amounted to 1025 million DDDs, which is
equivalent to 2.8 million patient-years. Citalopram
was the most commonly used SSRI (55%), followed
by sertraline (23%), paroxetine (12%), ﬂuoxetine
(8%), ﬂuvoxamine (1%) and escitalopram (1%).
Reporting incidences presented as the number of
cases of alopecia per million patient-years in Sweden
are shown in Table 2.
The number of reported cases with alopecia and the
respective IC values in SWEDIS and Vigibase are
shown in Table 3. Both in SWEDIS and in Vigibase,
sertraline showed a statistically signiﬁcant positive
association with alopecia. In Vigibase, but not in
SWEDIS, citalopram was also signiﬁcantly associated
with alopecia. Moreover, the IC values for alopecia
associated with citalopram were signiﬁcantly higher in
Vigibase than in SWEDIS. For the other SSRIs, no
statistically signiﬁcant associations were found.
DISCUSSION
Alopecia was reported with all of the available SSRIs.
There was a signiﬁcant positive association between

In two cases, two different SSRIs were implicated. Therefore, the total number of reports (27) is lower than the number of single drugs

sertraline and alopecia in Vigibase as well as in
SWEDIS and between citalopram and alopecia in
Vigibase. There was a signiﬁcantly higher reporting
incidence related to sales statistics for sertraline than
for citalopram. For the other SSRIs, no signiﬁcant
increases in reporting rates (more than what would be
expected to be caused by chance alone) compared with
citalopram, the SSRI with the lowest reporting rate of
alopecia, were revealed. Thus, a difference in the risk
of alopecia between the various SSRIs may exist.
The results could, however, also be caused by
bias. A bias in reporting related to sales data may be
due to a general increase in reporting of ADRs with
sertraline as opposed to other drugs such as
citalopram. The use of patient-years in the denominator may also inﬂuence reporting incidences for the
various drugs if the distribution of user years differs
between the drugs. For example, the average treatment
duration or the average prescribed daily dose in
relation to the DDD may differ between the various
SSRIs. A general increase in reporting rate of ADRs
with sertraline as opposed to other drugs was, on the

other hand, not suggested by the BCPNN data, as the
IC value, which corrects for the general reporting of
ADRs to a drug, was also signiﬁcantly increased for
sertraline. The possibility that reporting of alopecia
was selectively increased with sertraline cannot be
completely excluded, but would then appear to have
taken place both nationally and internationally.
Nevertheless, also the IC values may be treated with
caution. In general, a signiﬁcant positive IC value can
be due to a truly higher incidence of the ADR with the
drug, a (selectively) higher reporting rate of the ADR
with the drug (e.g. through media attention), a truly
lower incidence of other ADRs with the drug or a
(selectively) lower reporting rate of other ADRs with
the drug. The picture is further complicated by
possible differences in susceptibility to certain ADRs
(or in the tendency to report certain ADRs) in different
populations due to ethnic differences, environmental
or lifestyle factors, treatment guidelines, prescribing
patterns etc.
The true incidence of alopecia cannot be estimated
from these data because of the underreporting in

spontaneous reporting systems as well as the
possibility for alopecia to go undetected by the
patient and/or the physician. On the other hand, there
is also a possibility that the incidence of SSRI-induced
alopecia is overestimated by spontaneous reporting
due to the erroneous assumption of a causal relation
between the SSRI and the reported alopecia. Alopecia
may have several causes including but not limited to
drugs, such as childbirth, iron deﬁciency, malnutrition
and various diseases.5 In this case, the possibility that
alopecia was caused by the depression rather than the
drug treatment needs to be considered, although
available evidence does not appear to favour a strong
role for depression in the pathogenesis of alopecia.6
Causality to a certain drug rests on the plausible
temporal relation between the use of the drug and the
appearance of the reaction, the disappearance of the
reaction when the drug is discontinued, and its reoccurrence following re-institution of the drug.
Several reports in SWEDIS fulﬁlled the ﬁrst two
criteria, whereas only one report fulﬁlled all three
criteria. With alopecia, it is especially difﬁcult to
ascertain a temporal relation between the drug and the
reaction since the hair loss often occurs months after
the insult.2,5
One patient experienced alopecia with two SSRIs
taken at separate occasions. Another patient successfully changed the SSRI for another SSRI and the hair
loss abated. Two patients recovered from the hair loss
after a dose decrease, and yet another patient
recovered despite continuing the treatment at an even
higher dose. The two cases that recovered after a dose
decrease and the case that developed alopecia after a
switch from the originator to a generic may indicate
that alopecia is a dose dependent phenomenon, at least
in some cases.
It has been shown that human skin can produce
serotonin and transform it into melatonin.7 Melatonin
has in turn been implicated in hair growth cycling.7 It
is, therefore, possible that treatments that interfere
with the serotonin homeostasis in the skin may alter
the balance between hair growth and hair shedding.
Evidence in favour of an effect of SSRIs on hair
growth has been presented from a small number of
patients with alopecia areata and concomitant
depression or generalized anxiety who exhibited
objective clinical improvement of their alopecia
following 3 months of treatment with citalopram.8
Alternative explanations for the improvement of
alopecia in these cases include spontaneous improvement or the possibility that improvement was
secondary to an antidepressant effect. A link between
serotonin and alopecia areata is further supported by

KEY POINTS
 Alopecia appears to be a rare adverse reaction
to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors
(SSRIs).
 The risk of alopecia seems to vary between
different SSRIs.
 The risk of alopecia may be higher in women
than in men.

the ﬁnding of increased whole blood serotonin
concentrations among such patients.9
All except three cases in this study were women. In
the previously published case reports on SSRIs and
alopecia, there is also a preponderance for women.10–
18
It is possible that women may be more preoccupied
with their hair and more prone to report such reactions
to their physicians. Hair loss may also be more
noticeable if the hair is long, and some men already
have limited hair on their sculls. Despite these
considerations, it cannot be excluded that women
have a true increased risk of SSRI-induced alopecia
compared with men, even when corrected for the fact
that more women than men are treated with SSRIs.
In conclusion, alopecia appears to be a rare adverse
reaction to SSRIs. There might be differences in the
risk of alopecia between the various SSRIs, and the
risk might be higher in women than in men. If a patient
develops alopecia during SSRI treatment and the
temporal relationship seems plausible, an ADR should
be suspected and consideration should be given to
changing the treatment to another antidepressant or
possibly decreasing the dose.
