Early Detection of Adverse Drug Reactions in Social Health Networks: A Natural Language Processing Pipeline for Signal Detection

Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) occur in nearly all patients on chemotherapy, causing morbidity and
therapy disruptions. Detection of such ADRs is limited in clinical trials, which are underpowered to
detect rare events. Early recognition of ADRs in the postmarketing phase could substantially reduce
morbidity and decrease societal costs. Internet community health forums provide a mechanism for
individuals to discuss real-time health concerns and can enable computational detection of ADRs.
Objective
The goal of this study is to identify cutaneous ADR signals in social health networks and compare the
frequency and timing of these ADRs to clinical reports in the literature.
Methods
We present a natural language processing-based, ADR signal-generation pipeline based on patient posts
on Internet social health networks. We identified user posts from the Inspire health forums related to
two chemotherapy classes: erlotinib, an epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitor, and nivolumab and
pembrolizumab, immune checkpoint inhibitors. We extracted mentions of ADRs from unstructured
content of patient posts. We then performed population-level association analyses and time-to-detection
analyses.
Results
Our system detected cutaneous ADRs from patient reports with high precision (0.90) and at frequencies
comparable to those documented in the literature but an average of 7 months ahead of their literature
reporting. Known ADRs were associated with higher proportional reporting ratios compared to
negative controls, demonstrating the robustness of our analyses. Our named entity recognition system
achieved a 0.738 microaveraged F-measure in detecting ADR entities, not limited to cutaneous ADRs,
in health forum posts. Additionally, we discovered the novel ADR of hypohidrosis reported by 23
patients in erlotinib-related posts; this ADR was absent from 15 years of literature on this medication
and we recently reported the finding in a clinical oncology journal.
Conclusions
Several hundred million patients report health concerns in social health networks, yet this information
is markedly underutilized for pharmacosurveillance. We demonstrated the ability of a natural language
processing-based signal-generation pipeline to accurately detect patient reports of ADRs months in
advance of literature reporting and the robustness of statistical analyses to validate system detections.
Our findings suggest the important contributions that social health network data can play in
contributing to more comprehensive and timely pharmacovigilance.

Introduction
Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are an important public health issue, causing considerable patient harm
with a high health care cost [1,2]. Serious ADRs occur in over 2 million patients annually in the United
States, resulting in 100,000 deaths [2]. It is difficult to comprehensively characterize ADRs during
premarket trials, as many serious ADRs, particularly rare ones, are discovered years after a drug has
been on the market [3]. Clinical trials are limited in their ability to detect ADRs because of their
relatively small cohort sizes, short durations, and a lack of enrolled patient diversity [4,5]. A significant

number of ADRs are recognized in the postmarket period, resulting in over 2 million injuries and US
$75 billion in annual health care costs [6,7]. Ongoing surveillance strategies are therefore necessary to
monitor drug safety during the postapproval period.
Spontaneous reporting systems (SRSs) are drug safety surveillance mechanisms designed by regulatory
agencies to monitor drug safety during the postmarket period. SRSs can effectively detect rare ADRs
by nature of their longitudinal profiling and wide reach of included reports but are limited by their
reliance on voluntary patient or provider reporting; it is estimated that more than 90% of ADRs are
underreported [8,9]. ADR underdetection has motivated efforts to include complementary, alternative
data sources for pharmacovigilance, including electronic health records and administrative claims [1012], biomedical literature [13,14], Internet search logs [15], patient posts in social media [16-18], and
multimodal systems that jointly analyze multiple sources of information for ADR detection [7].
Over 300 million patients seek and share health-related information from online Internet platforms such
as health forums, search engine logs, or tweets [18]. These social health networks provide a platform
for patients or caregivers to connect in discussing treatment options, drug side effects, and illness
trajectories. The valuable health-related content of user posts in social media can be used for public
health surveillance purposes [19], also termed infodemiology [20], including monitoring the spread of
contagious diseases such as influenza [21,22]; monitoring the time and geographical locations of
diseases [23]; health outcome measurement [24,25]; discovering associations between health-related
concepts such as drugs and diseases; and, particularly, monitoring adverse effects of medications
[16,17]. Several studies have highlighted the importance of utilizing social media as a resource for
pharmacovigilance [9]. User posts often contain informal, unstructured text from which it is more
challenging to extract medical information than from other, more-structured sources. Therefore, the
exploration of different natural language processing techniques in ADR concept detection from social
media postings has received significant attention from the medical informatics community [9,17],
though there are a paucity of studies focusing on drug-ADR, signal-generation methods based on social
media postings [26].
Here we use Inspire [27], one of the largest online social health networks, which contains over 12
million health-related patient posts, including discussions of therapy responses, adverse drug reactions,
and supplemental treatments. We present an ADR signal-generation pipeline based on patient posts in
social health networks and compare the timing and the rate of such ADRs with those published in
clinical literature. We demonstrate the capacity for early detection as well as discovery of ADRs using
Inspire content.
In this work, we focus on two classes of chemotherapeutics, targeted small molecule inhibitors and
immunotherapeutics, which are representative of the dramatic change in the chemotherapy landscape
since the early 2000s. These classes of agents are now commonly used in place of more traditional
antiproliferative agents and are associated with novel side-effect profiles related to their mechanisms of
action. Oncologists have experienced a particularly steep learning curve in recognizing these reactions,
which occur in essentially all patients and can be life-threatening [4,28] as there is limited-to-no longterm data with novel agents. A new subfield of oncology has emerged, aimed at recognizing which
reactions are reflective of treatment response, which warrant treatment cessation, and managing side
effects to permit treatment tolerability. To capture the breadth of reactions seen, here we focus on two
representative classes of cancer drugs: (1) epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors, which
are widely used by most oncologists for specific malignancies harboring EGFR mutations, have been in
practice for over 15 years, and, therefore, have well-established side-effect profiles; and (2) immune
checkpoint inhibitors, which are relatively new, having first gained US Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) approval in late 2014 and, therefore, have significantly less data available on their emerging
side-effect profiles. We report the construction of a pipeline to study the association of cutaneous
ADRs with these selected targeted cancer therapy drugs reported in patient postings in Inspire.

Early Detection of Adverse Drug Reactions in Social Health Networks: A Natural Language Processing Pipeline for Signal Detection

Methods
Overview
We defined a set of common and rare ADRs to study for their association with two classes of drugs: an
EGFR inhibitor, erlotinib, and the immune checkpoint programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) inhibitors,
nivolumab and pembrolizumab. We focused on eight skin-related ADRs in this work: rash, acne,
pruritus (ie, itchy skin), paronychia (ie, nail changes), xerosis (ie, dry skin), hypohidrosis, bullous
eruption (ie, blister), and psoriasis.
Drug Corpus Generation
The Inspire dataset consists of 7,320,546 discussion posts from 2005 to 2016. For each drug in the
study, we generated a corpus defined as a collection of user posts from Inspire, with every post
containing at least one mention of a keyword corresponding to one of the drugs of interest. To retrieve
relevant posts from the Inspire dataset, we used regular expressions, a simple text-processing method
for string matching. We created a regular expression pattern that implemented the exact string match.
We have provided the list of the drugs and the related regular expression in Multimedia Appendix 1.
We identified 55,778 posts for erlotinib and 15,738 for the combined PD-1 inhibitors, nivolumab and
pembrolizumab. Because nivolumab and pembrolizumab were more recently introduced and, therefore,
have less discussion content but essentially identical mechanisms, we combined posts for the two drugs
referencing the same ADR.
Detection of Adverse Drug Reactions
To extract ADR mentions from user posts, we used DeepHealthMiner (DHM), a neural network-based
named entity recognition (NER) system that is specifically trained to extract drug safety-related entities
from user-generated content in social media [29]. DHM is a supervised feed-forward neural network
that is trained to identify two different entity types: ADRs and drug indications. The original, labeled
training data is based on a dataset from DailyStrength [30], an online health community that contains
patient-generated reports of treatment experiences very similar to those from Inspire. The labeled
training data are the sentences from patient posts manually annotated for the entity span (ie, start and
end position offsets) and the type of entity (ie, ADR or indication). More detailed information about the
data and annotation details can be found in prior publications [31,32]. The unlabeled sentences from
user posts are also used for unsupervised training of the word embeddings, which are used as vectors
representing the input tokens to the NER system.
We retrained DHM using both labeled and unlabeled posts from Inspire. We retrained 150-dimensional
word embeddings by adding the 7 million Inspire posts to the original unlabeled sentences. We
manually labeled an additional 200 Inspire posts, following the original annotation guideline [31,32], to
retrain DHM using Inspire content. Some of the rare ADRs in this study are more frequently discussed
as indication mentions (eg, psoriasis or blistering) rather than ADRs in user postings; therefore, to
improve our system’s ability to correctly recognize such cases, we created a subset of 200 Inspire posts
from our corpus that particularly contained keywords from the rare seed ADRs. We annotated all the
ADR and indication mentions following the original annotation guidelines to retrain DHM using
Inspire content. The preliminary results showed that the system could successfully extract mentions of
rare ADRs after retraining on 200 posts.
To evaluate the performance of the retrained NER model in identifying ADR entities from Inspire
posts, we created a test set—the Inspire test set—consisting of 50 randomly selected posts. Two human
annotators labeled all mentions of ADRs, not limited to the selected ADRs in this study, corresponding

to any treatment reported in the posts (interannotator agreement: 90.9%). We used the F-measure to
quantify the interannotator agreement by considering one annotator as the gold standard [33].
The extracted ADR mentions along with the information about the related drugs were stored in a
database for further analyses of the associations among drugs and ADRs.
Normalization of Extracted Mentions
To map the extracted ADR mentions to Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) Concept Unique
Identifiers (CUIs), we generated a lexicon of the eight ADR concepts. We defined a set of seed CUIs
for these ADRs as shown in Multimedia Appendix 2. Using the UMLS hierarchy, we expanded every
seed concept by adding synonyms and alternative names. For “nail changes,” we further expanded by
including the children of the seed concepts (ie, is-a relation in the hierarchy). Every lexicon entry has a
name, UMLS CUI, related seed ADR concept, and an identifier that we defined to group all items
corresponding to a specific ADR. As an example, the lexicon entry “ingrown toenail (C0027343)” is an
expanded concept based on “Disorder of nail (C0027339),” and “nail changes” is the human readable
identifier for the ADR. Additionally, for every ADR, we added a set of colloquial phrases to the
lexicon (see Multimedia Appendix 2). The list of colloquial phrases was generated by physicians,
representing the list of words and phrases that they had seen patients use to describe their own
cutaneous ADRs. We included these to better capture how patients describe ADRs in their own words.
Finally, we used Lucene [34] to index the lexicon. Lucene has been utilized as a successful tool in
previous studies for normalizing biomedical entities [35,36]. We built a Lucene repository from the
lexicon by creating one Lucene document for each lexicon entry, indexing the corresponding UMLS
concept name and the CUI for each lexicon entry. The concept names are tokenized and lemmatized for
generalization.
For mapping an extracted ADR mention to a UMLS concept, we searched the index using the text span
extracted from the post by our NER system. We tokenized and lemmatized the extracted text span in
the same manner as the indexed concept names and generated a Lucene query to search the index. For
example, to map the extracted ADR mention “finger nails have been peeling” to a UMLS concept, we
search the index using the query keywords “finger nail have be peel” and retrieve “peel nail (Peeling of
nails: C0263531).” We retrieved a ranked list of the matched, relevant ADR concepts and chose the
top-ranked concept from this list.
Computing Drug and Adverse Drug Reaction Associations
The co-occurrence of a drug and a reported ADR in a post can be considered as a potential association.
To quantify the strength of an association between a drug and an ADR, we calculated the proportional
reporting ratio (PRR), a statistic widely used for ADR signal generation from spontaneous reporting
databases [26,37] and originally introduced by Evans et al [29]. The PRR quantifies ADR signals by
comparing the frequency at which an ADR is reported with a drug of interest compared to the
frequency at which the ADR is reported with other drugs (ie, comparison drugs) in the database.
We defined the comparison drugs by sorting drugs mentioned in Inspire by discussion frequency and
selecting those most highly discussed in Inspire discussion posts (frequency >5000). To reduce noise,
we excluded over-the-counter drugs with common indications (eg, pain and allergy drugs), as well as
several anti-inflammatory drugs (eg, prednisone and Humira) that have indications that match some of
our rare ADRs (eg, bullous eruption and psoriasis), given that patients discussing these drugs were
almost exclusively discussing their indications rather than experienced ADRs. The final comparison
drug list included 27 drugs, which are listed in Multimedia Appendix 3.
The PRR for an adverse reaction, R, and a drug, D, was calculated based on the following formula:

10/1/21, 3:46 PM

Early Detection of Adverse Drug Reactions in Social Health Networks: A Natural Language Processing Pipeline for Signal Detection

PRR(D,R) = (count[D∩R] / count[D]) / (count[!D∩R] / count[!D])
We defined count(D∩R) as the number of unique users that have reported both D and R in a post;
count(D) as the total number of users reporting any ADR for drug D, including all extracted mentions
by DHM (eg, weight gain or fatigue); count(!D∩R) as the total number of unique users that reported R
for comparison drugs, excluding D; and count(!D) as the total number of unique users that reported at
least one ADR for any drug except D.
Calibrating a Threshold for the Proportional Reporting Ratio
We performed empirical calibration to find the threshold at which the PRR may represent a true ADR
signal [38,39]. We considered the distribution of PRR scores for a set of drug-condition pairs with no
known associations. To create this negative control set, we first paired all 27 comparison drugs and the
eight target ADRs, totaling 216 drug-condition pairs. We then excluded the drug-condition pairs with
known associations (ie, ADR or indication) based on the Medi-Span Adverse Drug Effects Database
(Wolters Kluwer Health) and side-effect resource (SIDER) [40], leaving 86 pairs without any
documented associations. Based on the PRR formula, we expected and validated that drug-ADR pairs
with known and common associations have PRR values greater than 1 (see Figure 1). If a drug-ADR
pair has a known association, then the corresponding PRR will be relatively higher than that for pairs
with no associations. Our goal in excluding these known pairs from the negative control set was to
illustrate the distribution of PRRs for drug-ADR pairs with no known associations and use only these
to calibrate the threshold at which a PRR for an unknown drug-ADR pair would represent a significant,
novel result.

Figure 1
Comparison of proportional reporting ratio of skin adverse drug reactions (ADRs) reported in social health
forums with the ADR rate published in the literature. The ADR rate based on the literature are grouped as
follows: Not reported or rare = case report; reported = case series or in clinical trial; common = in
significant percentage of patients in large trials. The frequency at which ADRs are talked about is shown
by the size of the circle or triangle. The most common ADRs reported in the literature are also the most
discussed in the patient posts. EGFR: epidermal growth factor receptor; PD-1: programmed cell death 1.

It is important to note that a drug and a condition can be associated for reasons other than an ADR or
indication and may, therefore, co-occur frequently within the negative control set. We identified two
common reasons that a drug (drug x) and a condition (condition y) with no documented association cooccur frequently in user posts, therefore representing false positives. The first reason is related to
prescribing patterns: if a drug or a set of similar drugs are commonly prescribed with drug x, while the
reported ADR condition is not attributed to drug x, the ADR will appear more frequently with all
coprescribed drugs. For example, mentions of nail changes happen frequently with zoledronic acid;
however, while a true ADR is associated with capecitabine, which is frequently prescribed with
zoledronic acid, zoledronic acid is not responsible for the ADR. The second reason is that if condition y
is one of the syndromic conditions related to the indication for drug x, the related condition will cooccur with the drug at a similar rate to the true indication. For example, metformin can be prescribed
for polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), and patients with PCOS often have acne. Acne is not an ADR
associated with metformin but will co-occur frequently with mention of metformin by way of acne’s
association with PCOS.

Because of the potential for observing such drug-condition associations, we manually reviewed the
negative control set to exclude them, leaving 81 drug-ADR pairs with no association. The negative
control set is available in Multimedia Appendix 4.
Figure 2 depicts our overall pipeline and graphical depiction of the above methods.

Figure 2
Pipeline to identify adverse drug reaction (ADR) signals associated with epidermal growth factor receptor
(EGFR) and programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) inhibitors in social health networks. For drug-ADR pair
extraction, for each drug, we generate a collection of user posts containing at least one mention of the
drug. This drug corpus is then processed via DeepHealthMiner to recognize mentions of ADRs. The
extracted mentions are then mapped to the corresponding Unified Medical Language System (UMLS)
Concept Unique Identifiers (CUIs). The identified drug-ADR pairs and the related details, for both target
and comparison group, are then stored in a relational database. The proportional reporting ratio (PRR) is
calculated to quantify the drug-ADR relations. We calibrated the score using the distribution of the
negative control set.

Results
Finding Drug-Adverse Drug Reaction Signals From Forum Posts
We identified 50,574 Inspire posts related to EGFR inhibitors and 16,598 related to checkpoint
inhibitors; a total number of 13,600 ADR concepts extracted from the former and 812 concepts from
the latter mapped to the eight target ADRs. We evaluated the performance of the presented NER
method in identifying ADR mentions from the Inspire test set and achieved a microaveraged Fmeasure of 0.738 (0.731 precision and 0.745 recall).
To assess system performance in extraction and normalization of ADR concepts, we performed
additional manual validation of the extracted ADR concepts as described in the Methods. Our final
validation set for the entire pipeline for identifying drug-ADR pairs consisted of an additional 120
posts which had 15 randomly selected posts for every ADR that the system extracted for one of our
target drugs.
We considered an extracted concept as a true positive if the system correctly detected the relevant span
of text; classified the entity as an ADR rather than indication; and normalized the ADR to the correct
concept. Benchmarking results show that our system achieved a high performance (microaverage
precision of 0.90) in recognizing and normalizing the ADRs in the user posts.
The distribution of the frequencies and the calculated PRR of the skin ADRs extracted from the EGFR
inhibitor-related posts correlates closely with published observed rates in patients (see Figure 1),
further validating the pipeline for identifying ADRs. The PD-1 inhibitor ADR landscape is largely
limited to case reports; forum frequencies and PRR values correlate with published rates, suggesting
that those described to date accurately represent the emerging toxicity landscape (see Figure 1).
To determine the threshold at which PRR represents true signal warranting further investigation, we
plotted the PRR distribution for the 81 drug-ADR pairs in the negative control set (see Figure 3). More
than 95% of the pairs in this set have a PRR of less than 0.82; therefore, drug-ADR pairs with a PRR
greater than 1 can be considered as signaling true ADRs.

drug-adverse drug reaction (ADR) pairs. The mean is 0.12, median is 0.2, and maximum is 1.4,
highlighting a PRR threshold of 1, below which <5% of drug-ADR pairs have true associations.

Adverse Drug Reactions are Described in Internet Forums Prior to Published Reports
To compare the timing of online ADR reports to initial ADR reports in the literature, we looked at both
common and rare events associated with our target drugs. Papulopustular (ie, acneiform) rash and
fingernail changes are well-reported ADRs associated with erlotinib and were first described in
published case reports in September 2005 [41] and September 2006 [42], respectively. Inspire posts for
these reactions appeared 5 and 3 months in advance of publication, respectively. Psoriasis in the setting
of PD-1 inhibitor treatment was first documented in case reports in July 2015 [43] and May 2016 [44].
Inspire forum posts describing this ADR preceded the 2015 case report by 9 months (see Figure 4A).
Blistering reactions with PD-1 inhibitors were initially published as a case report in June 2015 [45] and
as a three-case series in May 2016 [46]. Forum descriptions preceded the first case report by 9 months
(see Figure 4B). Taken together, our data suggest a significant and consistent reporting lead-time
advantage in online health forum posts. Cutaneous ADRs in both EGFR and PD-1 inhibitors have been
reported to be associated with cancer response to therapy [47-50], highlighting the clinical utility of
early detection.

Figure 4
Cutaneous adverse drug reactions (ADRs) identified in Inspire forums precede initial published clinical
reports. We plotted cumulative post count (y-axis) at each date (x-axis) for time-to-detection analysis. (A)
Psoriasis was first reported in the literature as individual case reports with programmed cell death 1 (PD-1)
inhibitors in July 2015 and May 2016. Inspire users began describing psoriasis flares 9 months prior to the
first case report. (B) Bullous reactions with checkpoint inhibitors were first reported in the literature as a
case report with pembrolizumab in May 2015 and as a three-case series with nivolumab in May 2016.
Inspire cases were reported online 9 months before the initial case report.

Novel Adverse Drug Reaction Discovery in Social Health Networks
In early 2017, we documented three patients on erlotinib reporting hypohidrosis. Our system detected
23 unique Inspire users reporting hypohidrosis in causal association with erlotinib as early as 2006,
based on manual review of user posts, with a PRR score of 1.90 (see Figure 3). This predicted ADR is
absent from over 15 years of EGFR inhibitor literature, implicating a novel ADR detected through our
system extractions from online posts. EGFR is expressed in sweat glands [51] and decreases with
pharmacologic EGFR inhibition [52]. Interestingly, the hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia phenotype is
partially mediated by decreased EGFR signaling [53], which can possibly cause hypohidrosis. These
findings demonstrate the potential of ADR extraction from Internet forums to not only detect ADRs
earlier, but also to contribute to novel ADR discovery.

Discussion
Our retrospective analyses demonstrate the potential of conducting targeted ADR surveillance in real
time. Because many chemotherapeutics have nonspecific side-effect profiles, including nausea,
vomiting, and fatigue, which are shared with most antineoplastics as well as thousands of other drugs,
we see greater relevance in seeking specific signal-to-noise ratios based on clinically generated
hypotheses—that is, reactions seen with a drug, with a hypothesized causal association. For example,
our impetus for mining for hypohidrosis in association with erlotinib stemmed from a single clinical
encounter. As we built and applied our pipeline to the Inspire dataset, we eventually saw two more
patients in clinic with the same symptom; together, with the 23 Inspire users we identified, our system
reported statistically significant association, supporting the classification of this symptom as a true
ADR.
The presented methods in the signal generation pipeline can easily be applied to other drugs and ADRs.
Our NER system extracts ADRs independent of a specific drug and, therefore, the system performance
should easily translate to the study of other drugs. In fact, in our previous studies [17,29], we showed
that the presented NER methods tested on a dataset of user posts about 81 different drugs achieved high
performance in extracting mentions of ADRs, not limited to any specific ADR. Therefore, the NER
component can easily be applied to the majority of ADRs. However, if the goal is to identify specific
rare ADRs or mentions that often are presented in contexts different than ADRs (eg, psoriasis), the
system may be improved by adding additional relevant human-labeled training examples as we did in
this study. Future research is needed to further explore transfer learning techniques for improvement in
the performance of NER models when applied to the new tasks.
Furthermore, with respect to other ADRs, the only additional effort needed for their inclusion would be
normalization and determination of grouping of the UMLS concepts attributed to a single ADR (eg, the
concepts that can be considered as “nail changes”). For normalization, we used the seed ADRs to
identify and group the concepts that indicated the target ADRs in our study. Overall, the precise
normalization of medical mentions in text is a challenging task in biomedical information extraction
[36]; particularly for the medical entities in user posts [54], future research could explore alternative
techniques for optimal normalization of medical concepts in social media postings.
Our study demonstrates that it is possible to detect ADR signals from patient-generated social media
posts an average of 7 months earlier than literature reporting and at frequencies comparable to their
eventual literature descriptions. We describe the proof-of-principle construction and validation of a
signal generation pipeline for ADR detection from social health networks. We benchmark our system
extractions of known drug events against their literature reports to evaluate our pipeline’s accuracy and
temporal advantage. Our system is able to extract drug-ADR signals from highly unstructured online
patient content with high precision.
In this work, we demonstrate the utility of mining online patient reports to identify signals for both
common and rare ADRs with high precision. We envision the potential for social media-based signals
to be combined with those derived from alternative modes—electronic health records, insurance
claims, and FDA reports—to construct the most comprehensive and dynamic catalogue of ADRs.
Looking ahead, we envision the utility of a live pharmacovigilance system that reports emerging drugADR association signals over the course of days to weeks and sends these reports to physicians for
review and comparison with clinical experience. This would enable tracking of individual reports and
changing PRRs over time, providing the reviewing physicians with access to a significantly broader
patient cohort than seen in single treatment centers. We do anticipate potential new challenges in
capturing how patients describe ADRs that are not directly visible to them, which will be an engaging
and important area of further study.

If a reporting system such as ours were extended to public use, we also anticipate the inherent risks and
challenges associated with patient access. While many patients search for their health concerns before
presenting to clinicians, they are often misguided, which may impact the decision to seek care or
timing of visit to a physician. A system such as ours, which captures the experiences of millions of
patients, may be able to offer context for patients to understand their concerns, but it would be a further
challenge to offer triaging of ADR severity to patients based solely on the reports of other patients and
should instead serve to motivate patients to discuss their concerns in a timely manner with their own
doctors.
