Abstract
Background Digoxin immune fab products, DigiBind and DigiFab, are antidotes for the treatment of patients with lifethreatening or potentially life-threatening digoxin toxicity or overdose. Although approved by the US Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) in 1986 (DigiBind) and 2001 (DigiFab), there remains a paucity of literature describing the safety of
these products in the postmarketing setting.
Objective We sought to assess US adverse event (AE) reports submitted to the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System
(FAERS) for DigiBind and DigiFab in the postmarketing period.
Patients and Methods We searched reports for DigiBind and DigiFab submitted from the time of each product approval
through December 31, 2019. Descriptive statistics were used to assess AE reports for DigiBind and DigiFab. Empirical
Bayes geometric means (EBGMs) and their 90% confidence intervals were computed to identify disproportionate (i.e., at
least twice the expected) reporting of DigiBind and DigiFab. Reports describing selected AEs and death outcomes were
individually reviewed.
Results A total of 78 DigiBind and 43 DigiFab reports were identified, of which 68 DigiBind (87.2%) and 27 DigiFab
(62.8%) reports were serious. Among the most frequently reported AEs for both products [DigiBind, DigiFab, respectively]
were cardiac (bradycardia [3.8%, 3.9%], cardiac arrest [3.3%, 3.9%], and hypotension [2.4%, 2.6%]) and non-cardiac (nausea
[1.9%, 2.6%] and hyperkalemia [1.4%, 1.9%]) events. These AEs were labeled events or confounded by indication for use
(digoxin toxicity). Nineteen (24.4%) DigiBind and 13 (30.2%) DigiFab reports described an outcome of death, of which seven
(53.8%) DigiFab reports were attributed to poisoning with non-digoxin cardiac glycosides. No deaths could be attributed to
DigiBind or DigiFab administration.
Conclusions Our analysis did not identify new safety concerns for DigiBind or DigiFab. Most AEs reported were labeled
events or confounded by indication for use.

1 Introduction
Digoxin immune fab, a sterile, purified, and lyophilized
preparation of digoxin-immune ovine fab (monovalent)
immunoglobulin fragments, is indicated for the treatment of
patients with life-threatening or potentially life-threatening
digoxin toxicity or overdose [1]. Digoxin-specific antibody
prepared from sheep antiserum was first introduced in 1967

as an immunoassay for digoxin in human serum [2], and
in 1976 it was used to treat a patient with life-threatening
digoxin toxicity [3]. The first digoxin immune fab product,
DigiBind, was licensed by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in April 1986. In August 2001, the FDA
approved a second product, DigiFab. There have been no
other digoxin immune fab products approved in the USA.
DigiBind (immunized with digoxin) and DigiFab (immunized with a digoxin derivative, digoxin dicarboxymethylamine) possess similar pharmacokinetic properties and are
clinically interchangeable [4, 5]. Digoxin immune fab has a
greater affinity for digoxin than digoxin has for its sodium
pump receptor. After administration, digoxin immune fab
binds to molecules of digoxin, thereby reducing free digoxin
levels and its cardio-toxic effects [5].

Key Points
Postmarketing DigiBind and DigiFab reports submitted
to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Adverse
Event Reporting System (FAERS) revealed that adverse
events (AEs) were generally consistent with the safety
experience observed in pre-licensure clinical trials and
the products’ package inserts.
Cardiac (bradycardia, cardiac arrest, and hypotension)
and non-cardiac (nausea and hyperkalemia) AEs were
among the most commonly reported for both products.
A substantial number of death reports were attributed
to glycoside poisoning with agents other than digoxin
(off-label use), but no deaths were attributed to DigiBind
and DigiFab.

Between 2007 and 2009, nearly 3500 US hospitalizations
among patients 65 years of age or older were associated with
digoxin-related adverse events (AEs), and digoxin was the
most commonly implicated agent in emergency department
visits for adverse drug events that resulted in hospitalization
[6]. These and other clinical scenarios present opportunities
for patient exposure to digoxin immune fab. Notably, most
of the safety information available for DigiBind and DigiFab
has been derived from small clinical trials and observational
studies [7]; thus, the safety profile of these agents, particularly for rare and serious events occurring in the postmarketing setting, is unknown. To address this information gap, we
reviewed DigiBind and DigiFab AE reports submitted to the
FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) following
approval of each product in the USA.

a corresponding primary (and secondary, if applicable)
SOC. Based on the extent of clinically relevant information included in ten key data fields, each report is assigned
a completeness score; a penalty is assigned for missing
information, thereby lowering the completeness score [10].
FAERS reports can be submitted as “expedited reports”
(serious and unexpected AEs required to be reported by
pharmaceutical companies to the US FDA within 15 days of
receipt), “direct reports” (submitted directly to the US FDA
by health care professionals or consumers outside of pharmaceutical companies), or “non-expedited reports” (serious
expected events and nonserious events submitted by pharmaceutical companies to the US FDA on a regular basis). A
report is considered serious when an AE(s) results in death,
life-threatening illness, hospitalization or prolongation of
existing hospitalization, permanent disability, or birth defect
[11]. The outcome of the AE(s) is specified by the individual
submitting the report, and one or more outcomes may be
specified per report. All the information in a FAERS report,
including the case narrative, is available to FDA reviewers
performing postmarketing surveillance activities.
We searched the FAERS database for all US reports submitted for DigiBind or DigiFab from the product approval
date (DigiBind April 29, 1986; DigiFab August 31, 2001)
through December 31, 2019. We allowed follow-up information to be submitted on these reports through March 31,
2020, the study data lock point (DLP). In September 2011,
DigiBind was discontinued in the USA (unrelated to a safety
concern); however, reports may be submitted to FAERS at
any time, even after a product has been discontinued. We
excluded foreign reports because DigiBind and DigiFab
approval and marketing dates varied from those in the USA
and clinical practice and drug usage patterns potentially differ between countries.

2.2 Data Analysis

2 Methods

2.2.1 Descriptive Analysis

2.1 FAERS Database

We separately assessed all AEs reported for DigiBind and
DigiFab using descriptive statistics (Stata/IC 13.1; StataCorp LLC, College Station, Texas), without regard for
potential duplicate reports. Age and sex statistics included
information gleaned from manual review of reports when
the information was not available in the relevant age and sex
data fields but was specified in the report text.

FAERS is a spontaneous, passive surveillance system
that collects information on AEs, medication errors, and
product quality issues associated with drugs and biologic
products [8]. The database collects information on patient
demographics, medical history, concomitant medications,
description and outcome of the AE, and source of the report.
Reported events are coded according to the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA), which includes
broad (System Organ Class [SOC]) and specific event categories (e.g., Preferred Term [PT]) [9]. Our analysis was
based on MedDRA version 22.1. A single FAERS report is
assigned one or more PTs, and each PT is included within

2.2.2 Data Mining Analysis
We conducted empirical Bayes data mining using the
Multi-Item Gamma Poisson Shrinker algorithm in the Oracle Empirica™ Signal system to assess for disproportional
reporting of AEs reported for DigiBind and DigiFab. The

255

Adverse Events Associated with Use of Digoxin Immune Fab

Empirica Signal system utilizes a case-matching algorithm
applied to all FAERS reports that systematically identifies
likely duplicate reports [12]. Analyses were limited to US
reports, undertaken separately for DigiBind and DigiFab,
and adjusted for year of report received at the FDA, sex, and
age. The main statistical score computed was the empirical Bayes geometric mean (EBGM) and the 90% confidence interval, with the lower and upper 95% confidence
bounds represented as EB05 and EB95, respectively [12].
The EBGM reflects the relative reporting rate after Bayesian smoothing for a drug/biologic–event pair relative to all
other drug/biologic–event pairs in the FAERS database [13].
An EB05 ≥ 2 is the threshold commonly used by the FDA
as a criterion for considering an AE a potential signal to be
further investigated. This threshold is associated with a high
probability of a drug/biologic–event pair being reported at
least twice as often as expected under the assumption that
drug/biologic–events are randomly paired [14]. Data mining findings are used for signal detection but do not imply
a causal association between the drug/biologic–event pair
identified.
2.2.3 Case Reviews
We reviewed all death reports to determine the stated cause
of death and events surrounding the death. We also reviewed
reports describing AEs of special interest, including unlabeled events (AEs not included on the US Package Insert
[USPI]), medication errors, and off-label use. Duplicate
reports were excluded from individual case review.

2.3 Ethics
This safety review was exempt from institutional review
board approval or informed patient consent because it met
the criteria for exemption from the Office for Protection from
Research Risks, as specified in the Department of Health and
Human Services regulations [15].

3 Results
We identified a total of 78 DigiBind and 43 DigiFab reports
submitted to the FAERS during each study period, of which
87.2% DigiBind and 62.8% DigiFab reports were serious
(Table 1). Among reports with specified age, the median
(range) patient age was 73 (0–93) and 66 (16–101) years for
DigiBind and DigiFab, respectively. A greater percentage of
reports were submitted for females, individuals ≥ 65 years
of age, and as expedited reports. More than half of reports
had a completeness score below 60%. Death was reported

as an outcome for 24.4% of reports for DigiBind and 30.2%
of reports for DigiFab.

3.1 Most Frequently Reported PTs for DigiBind
and DigiFab
In total, there were 212 PTs describing 78 DigiBind reports
and 155 PTs describing 43 DigiFab reports (Table 2).
Among the most frequent PTs reported for both products
were cardiac (bradycardia, cardiac arrest, and hypotension) or non-cardiac (nausea and hyperkalemia) events. The
majority of PTs represented labeled events, of which many
were confounded by indication for product use. PTs describing unlabeled AEs included medication error, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) increased, aspartate aminotransferase
(AST) increased, dermatitis, and pancreatitis.

3.2 Data Mining (Disproportionality Analyses)
Bradycardia, cardiac arrest, toxicity to various agents, and
cardioactive drug level increased were disproportionately
reported for both DigiBind and DigiFab (Table 3). In addition, ventricular tachycardia was reported more than twice as
frequently as expected for DigiBind, and medication error,
off-label use, and completed suicide were disproportionately
reported for DigiFab.

3.3 Case Review
3.3.1 Death Reports
A total of 19 DigiBind and 13 DigiFab reports with an outcome of death were identified (Table 4). Among DigiBind
reports with specified age (63.2%), 67% of deaths occurred
among individuals 65 years of age or older (median age 70.5
years), and most reports (78.9%) did not specify the cause
of death. In contrast, among DigiFab death reports with
specified age (84.6%), the median age was 39 (range 19–90)
years, with more than half (53.8%) of the total deaths attributed to intentional poisoning by agents other than digoxin
(e.g., English yew, Piedra China, Almendra quema grasa,
Cerbera odollam, and oleander leaves).
3.3.2 Unlabeled AEs
The unlabeled AEs reported for DigiBind included dermatitis (n = 3), AST/ALT elevation (n = 3), and pancreatitis (n =
3). Only one dermatitis report provided clinical details and
described an associated allergic reaction (no other details).
After excluding two duplicate reports (one AST/ALT elevation report and one pancreatitis report), the remaining

reports of AST/ALT elevation and pancreatitis described
either a patient with multiple comorbidities or lacked clinical details, thereby limiting causality assessments.
3.3.3 Medication Error
There were five DigiBind medication error reports. Three
reports described accidental overdose (higher dose than
indicated on the USPI) of DigiBind, of which two reports
did not describe any AE and one described transient atrial
fibrillation. There were two product-related reports; one was
related to a label issue and the other to an administration
issue (with no description of an AE). There were six DigiFab
medication error reports; five referred to mislabeling of dose
information on the vial and one report described a falsely
increased digoxin level.
3.3.4 Off‑Label Use (Non‑digoxin Cardiac Glycoside
Poisoning)
There were 12 DigiFab reports describing off-label use.
Except for one report related to digoxin toxicity, all other
reports described use of DigiFab for treatment of intentional
poisoning by a cardiac glycoside-related product other than
digoxin. A case listing of reports involving non-digoxin cardiac glycoside poisoning (11 reports with a PT of off-label
use and one report with a PT of cardiac arrest) is presented
in Table 5. Of 12 reports describing non-digoxin poisoning,
the median (range) age of patients was 33 (16–86) years.
Most reports were submitted for males (58.3%) and individuals < 65 years of age (83.3%). The ingested poisoning agents included Almendra quema grasa, Piedra China,
Taxus baccata (English or European yew), oleander leaves,
toad head, Cerbera odollam seeds, Jamaican stones, Convallaria majalis, and Crataegus mexicana root. The median
(range) amount of DigiFab administered to these 12 cases
was 9.5 (2–33) vials (40 mg per vial); seven reports were
associated with a death outcome.

The completeness score is derived from the amount of clinically relevant information available on reports and whether they are recorded
in a usable way. The formula to calculate the completeness score is
CS = (1 − P1) * (1 − P2)…(1 − P10), where P denotes a predetermined penalty for each of the ten elements. When information is
present or meaningful, the penalty is zero

4 Discussion
To our knowledge, this study of DigiBind and DigiFab is the
first to describe AEs reported in the postmarketing period in
the population at large. We found that the majority of AEs
represented labeled events described in the USPI or were
confounded by indication for product use.

PTs describing adverse events (safety) that are included in the US Package Insert are considered labeled

FAERS report does not imply causality

Although digoxin use declined in the USA between 2005
and 2014 [16], between 2007 and 2009, digoxin toxicity
accounted for more than 80% of emergency department
visits resulting in hospitalization related to adverse drug
events among patients 65 years of age or older [6]. Based
on the Premier Perspective Comparative Hospital Database, which included data collected from more than 450 US
hospitals, Hauptman et al. identified 22,629 patients diagnosed with digoxin toxicity, including 3086 patients treated
with digoxin immune fab, between 2007 and 2011, and
estimated that 41,754 hospital visits were associated with

digoxin immune fab treatment nationwide [17]. While we
do not have information on the number of patients exposed
to DigiBind and DigiFab over the time periods of our study,
the relatively limited number of FAERS reports may reflect
the favorable safety profile of these agents. Previous clinical trials and observational studies reported that the most
common adverse reactions related to digoxin immune fab
included allergic reactions, hypokalemia, exacerbation of
heart failure, increased ventricular response in atrial fibrillation, and recrudescence of digoxin toxicity [7, 18–21]. In our
analysis of FAERS reports, the majority of reported AEs for

DigiFab administered following ingestion of Almendra quema grasa (n = 1), Cerbera odollam seeds (n
= 3), Convallaria majalis (n = 1), Crataegus mexcicana (n = 1), Taxus baccata (English yew or European
yew) (n = 2), Jamaican stone (n = 1), oleander leaves (n = 1), Piedra China (n = 1), or toad head (n = 1)

DigiBind and DigiFab were clinical manifestations associated with digoxin toxicity (e.g., bradycardia, cardiac arrest,
atrioventricular block, nausea, vomiting, and hyperkalemia)
and were therefore confounded by indication for product use.
In the data mining analyses, these AEs were also disproportionately reported, highlighting that signal identification
does not imply causality and may reflect concomitant drug
use, confounding by indication, or other factors. Because
patients prescribed digoxin are frequently elderly, have multiple underlying comorbidities (e.g., congestive heart failure,
renal impairment), and multiple co-administered medications (polypharmacy), these factors can obscure the recognition of digoxin immune fab-related AEs. We did not observe
all of the AEs identified by previous clinical and observational studies, possibly due to the rarity of AEs associated
with these products, underreporting of AEs to FAERS, or
limited product utilization.
We identified unlabeled AEs in our review of FAERS
reports, e.g., dermatitis, ALT/AST increased, and pancreatitis. However, we were unable to undertake a meaningful causality assessment due to the paucity of information
included on the reports, concomitant medications reported,
and multiple underlying patient comorbidities. Medication

error reports were related to administration of a higher dose
than recommended on the USPI (without a reported AE) or
product issues not related to a safety concern.
As cardiac glycoside-related products have become
increasingly available on the internet for nonmedicinal purposes, non-digoxin cardiac glycoside poisonings have been
increasingly reported in the USA [22, 23]. Consistent with
this observation, we found that FAERS reports describing
off-label use were limited to DigiFab and submitted in more
recent calendar years (2011–2019). Most of these reports
referenced intentional poisoning with herbs and supplements structurally related to cardiac glycosides, with few
patients having an elevated serum digoxin level. The reports
described clinical manifestations similar to those observed
with digoxin toxicity, including bradycardia, atrioventricular
block, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and hyperkalemia.
Literature reports have described successful use of digoxin
immune fab in managing non-digoxin cardiac glycoside
poisonings with oleander leaves [24], toad venom [25],
and some Chinese herbal supplements [26, 27]; others have
reported unfavorable outcomes, including in cases of severe
yew poisoning [28, 29].

An important strength of our study is the national representation of AEs reported for DigiBind and DigiFab in the
real-world setting, during a postmarketing study period of
more than 30 years. Limitations include absence of denominator data and reliance on passive surveillance, which is
associated with underreporting, duplicate reporting, varying
report quality, and reporting bias (e.g., tendency to report
more severe AEs, such as death, and those occurring closer
to the time of product administration) [30]. In addition,
we did not have information on product distribution and

utilization, thereby limiting an assessment of frequency of
AEs and reporting rates.

5 Conclusions
In summary, our analysis of FAERS reports did not raise
new safety concerns for DigiBind or DigiFab. Most AEs
reported were labeled events included in the USPI or confounded by indication for product use.

Almendra quema grasa, also known as “fat-burning almond,” is a weight-loss supplement. It is a nut derived from Thevetia peruviana (Cascabela thevetia) that contains cardiac glycosides. The plant is native throughout Mexico and in Central America. It is a relative of Nerium oleander,
from which it derives its common name, yellow oleander

b
C. odollam, commonly referred to as suicide tree, pong-pong, mintolla, or othalam, is a plant species in the family Apocynaceae. Its kernel contains cerberin, a digoxin-type cardenolide and cardiac glycoside toxin. This species is native to India and other parts of Southeast Asia
c

T. baccata is an ornamental tree known as yew (common yew, English yew, European yew) that is native to Western, Central, and Southern
Europe; Northwest Africa; Northern Iran, and Southwest Asia. Most parts of the plant are poisonous because they contain taxine alkaloids, of
which the highest concentration is in the seeds

d
C. majalis, commonly called lily of the valley, is a woodland flowering plant. It is native throughout the Northern Hemisphere in Asia and
Europe. The plant has been used in herbal medicines for mild congestive heart failure and arrhythmias. All parts of the plant are potentially poisonous, causing nausea, vomiting, and irregular cardiac rhythm if ingested
e

C. mexicana is a species of hawthorn plant known by the common name of tejocote and is native to the mountains of Mexico and parts of Guatemala. It has been marketed as a weight-loss supplement through the internet, and several hawthorn species have been found to have positive
inotropic effects

f

Several toad species contain bufadienolides in their skin, venom glands, and eggs. Bufadienolides are cardioactive steroids with properties similar to digoxin

g
Jamaican stones or Piedra China is a topical aphrodisiac. It is derived from toad venom and is also referred to as Rock Hard, Love Stone, Piedra China, or Chan su
