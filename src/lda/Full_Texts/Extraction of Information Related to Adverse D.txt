Abstract
Background
Pharmacovigilance and drug-safety surveillance are crucial for monitoring adverse drug events
(ADEs), but the main ADE-reporting systems such as Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event
Reporting System face challenges such as underreporting. Therefore, as complementary surveillance,

data on ADEs are extracted from electronic health record (EHR) notes via natural language processing
(NLP). As NLP develops, many up-to-date machine-learning techniques are introduced in this field,
such as deep learning and multi-task learning (MTL). However, only a few studies have focused on
employing such techniques to extract ADEs.
Objective
We aimed to design a deep learning model for extracting ADEs and related information such as
medications and indications. Since extraction of ADE-related information includes two steps—named
entity recognition and relation extraction—our second objective was to improve the deep learning
model using multi-task learning between the two steps.
Methods
We employed the dataset from the Medication, Indication and Adverse Drug Events (MADE) 1.0
challenge to train and test our models. This dataset consists of 1089 EHR notes of cancer patients and
includes 9 entity types such as Medication, Indication, and ADE and 7 types of relations between these
entities. To extract information from the dataset, we proposed a deep-learning model that uses a
bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) conditional random field network to recognize
entities and a BiLSTM-Attention network to extract relations. To further improve the deep-learning
model, we employed three typical MTL methods, namely, hard parameter sharing, parameter
regularization, and task relation learning, to build three MTL models, called HardMTL, RegMTL, and
LearnMTL, respectively.
Results
Since extraction of ADE-related information is a two-step task, the result of the second step (ie,
relation extraction) was used to compare all models. We used microaveraged precision, recall, and F1
as evaluation metrics. Our deep learning model achieved state-of-the-art results (F1=65.9%), which is
significantly higher than that (F1=61.7%) of the best system in the MADE1.0 challenge. HardMTL
further improved the F1 by 0.8%, boosting the F1 to 66.7%, whereas RegMTL and LearnMTL failed to
boost the performance.
Conclusions
Deep learning models can significantly improve the performance of ADE-related information
extraction. MTL may be effective for named entity recognition and relation extraction, but it depends
on the methods, data, and other factors. Our results can facilitate research on ADE detection, NLP, and
machine learning.

Introduction
Background
An adverse drug event (ADE) is an injury resulting from a medical drug intervention [1]. Previous
studies reported that ADEs could account for up to 41% of all hospital admissions [2,3]. An ADE may
cause a prolonged length of stay in the hospital and increase the economic burden [4]. The annual cost
of ADEs for a 700-bed hospital is approximately $5.6 million [5]. Moreover, the total number of
iatrogenic deaths can reach nearly 800,000 per year, which is higher than the death rate of heart disease

or cancer [6]. In 2013, medical error, including ADEs, is the third most-common cause of death in the
United States [7]. Therefore, ADE detection and report are crucial for pharmacovigilance and drugsafety surveillance [8,9].
Two methods are usually used to detect and report ADE. In premarketing surveillance, ADEs can be
discovered during phase III clinical trials for drug development. In postmarketing surveillance, ADEs
are discovered by patients and physicians using the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Adverse
Event Reporting System (FAERS). These traditional methods are limited by the number of participants
[10], underreporting [11], and missing patterns of drug exposure [12]; for example, underreporting is a
known issue in FAERS and may occur due to several reasons. First, the objective and content of the
report in FAERS change over time, which may confuse physicians and the general public. Second,
patients may choose not to mention some reactions, due to which practitioners fail to report them.
Third, ADEs with long latency or producing unusual symptoms may be unrecognized. Other reasons
may include payments from pharmaceutical companies to doctors [13] and inefficient communication
between patients, physicians, and pharmacists. Recently, the FDA made the FAERS data available
through a public dashboard [14]. Since anyone can view ADE reports online, this venture may help the
FDA receive feedback to improve the FAERS.
Many researchers have used other resources to identify ADEs, such as biomedical publications [15,16],
social media [17,18], and electronic health record (EHR) notes [19-21]. The ADEs extracted from these
resources are an important complement to traditional ADE-surveillance systems. However, manual
collection of ADEs from these data is laborious [22]. As such, the use of computer systems is a good
choice to automatically detect ADEs, but may fail since these data are often unstructured text.
Therefore, natural language processing (NLP) techniques are employed for this significant task
[15,20,21,23].
From the viewpoint of NLP, ADE detection is covered under the task of information extraction, which
includes ADE extraction as well as information related to ADE, such as medications and indications.
Extraction of ADE-related information can be casted as a two-step pipeline. The first step is named
entity recognition (NER) [24], which recognizes a string of text as an entity (eg, medication or ADE)
that is predefined by dataset annotators. The second step is relation extraction (RE) [15], which is a
model that determines whether two entities have a specific relation (eg, ﻿medication and ADE).
Previous studies employed traditional machine-learning techniques [15,16,23,24] such as condition
random field (CRF) [25] or support vector machine (SVM) [26]. Recently, deep learning attracted
much attention in NLP due its numerous advantages such as better performances and less feature
engineering compared to other systems [27,28]. However, only a few studies have addressed extraction
of ADE-related information via deep learning. Since ADE detection can be divided into two tasks (ie,
NER and RE), it is logical to incorporate multi-task learning (MTL) [29] into ADE detection. However,
only limited prior work has investigated the impact of MTL on ADE detection.
Relevant Literature
Adverse Drug Event Detection Since ADEs play an important role in drug-safety surveillance, ADE

detection receives increasing attention from both the federal regulation and the research community.
Besides the official reporting system FAERS, there are other databases that collect data on known
ADEs, such as the Comparative Toxicogenomics Database [30] and SIDER [31]. Various resources
have been used to detect ADEs, such as biomedical publications [15,16], social media [17,18], and
electronic health record (EHR) notes [19-21]. For example, Gurulingappa et al [16] leveraged medical
case reports to build a corpus in order to support drug-related adverse effects. Wei et al [15] organized a
challenge task to extract chemical-induced disease relations from the literature and created an
annotated corpus from 1500 articles. With respect to the methods, both supervised and unsupervised

methods were used. Ramesh et al [32] developed a supervised machine-learning model to extract
adverse event entities from FAERS narratives. Xu and Wang [33] used a semisupervised bootstrapped
method to construct a knowledge base for the drug-side-effect association. Liu et al [34] proposed a
causality-analysis model based on structure learning for identifying factors that contribute to adverse
drug reactions. Yildirim et al [35] applied the k-mean algorithm to identify adverse reactions. Xu et al
[23] used SVM to extract ADEs between sentence-level and document-level drug-disease pairs.
Recently, Munkhdalai et al [21] attempted to use deep learning to address ADE extraction, but their
model was not end-to-end and relied on the entities.
Named Entity Recognition NER is a standard task that has been studied for many years in NLP [25].

Many researchers made important contributions to dataset construction including the GENIA corpus
[36], the NCBI disease corpus [37], and the ShARe/CLEF eHealth evaluation [38]. Early studies
addressed NER by diverse approaches such as rule-based [39] and machine-learning approaches [4042], among which CRF-based approaches predominated. For example, Campos et al [40] presented
a CRF model to recognize biomedical names, which achieved state-of-the-art performance at the time
by incorporating rich features. Tang et al [43] modified the label scheme of CRF to make it be capable
of recognizing disjoint clinical concepts. However, such approaches need many efforts for feature
engineering. Recently, a bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) model [44,45] was proposed and became a
popular method for NER. In the biomedical domain, Jagannatha and Yu [20] used such a model to
detect medical events from EHR notes.
Relation Extraction RE has been widely studied, and some typical RE corpora in the biomedical

domain include the 2010 i2b2/VA challenge [46] and BioCreative V CDR task [15]. Early work used
rules and NLP structures such as dependency trees [47] and coreference chains [48] to help extract
relations. Others usually leveraged machine-learning approaches such as SVM [49,50] and structured
learning [51]. As deep learning developed, researchers proposed a number of neural network models to
handle RE [52,53]. Our study is related to the joint or end-to-end entity and RE, which allows
performance of NER and RE simultaneously. Miwa and Bansal [54] proposed an end-to-end model
based on the sequence and tree LSTM. Similarly, Mehryary et al [55] proposed an end-to-end system to
extract information about bacteria and their habitats.
Multi-Task Learning MTL [29] refers to training the model for multiple related tasks. It is widely used

in artificial intelligence research such as computer vision [56] and NLP [57]. Learning these tasks
simultaneously may improve the performance as compared to learning the tasks individually. Prior
MTL studies mostly focused on homogeneous MTL that consists of tasks with only one type such as
classification or regression [58]. Some of their tasks are closely related, such as cross-lingual [59] and
synthetic data [60]. Based on a previous study [58], MTL can be roughly divided into two categories—
hard and soft parameter sharing. For hard parameter sharing, the lower layers are shared among
multiple tasks and each task has its own higher layer [54]. For soft parameter sharing, each task has its
own model with its own parameters. There are some representative methods for soft parameter sharing
such as regularization [59] or learning task relations [56].
Objective
Since only a few prior studies have addressed end-to-end detection of ADE via deep learning, we
aimed to design a two-step pipeline model that consists of two submodels: a BiLSTM [61] CRF [25]
network for NER and a BiLSTM-Attention [62] network for RE. Since extraction of ADE-related
information includes two steps, it is possible to study the impact of MTL on NER and RE. However,
only limited prior work has focused on MTL with such heterogeneous and loosely related tasks.
Therefore, our second objective was to fill this gap by proposing three MTL models and comparing
them with the pipeline model. An overview of this study is shown in Figure 1.

Methods
Deep Learning Pipeline Model
BiLSTM-CRF Submodel for NER Our NER submodel is presented in Figure 2. We extended the state-

of-the-art BiLSTM-CRF model [44,45] by enriching its features. For a sentence, we extracted four
kinds of features for each token, namely, its word, whether the initial character is capital, its part-ofspeech (POS) tag, and its character representation. We employed a convolutional neural network to
obtain character representation. After the token representations are obtained by concatenating the
features, we fed them into a bidirectional LSTM layer to learn the hidden representations.
Subsequently, the hidden representations were input into the CRF layer to determine the optimal labels
for all the tokens in the sentence. For labels, we use the BMES (Begin, Middle, End, Singular) label
scheme [45] plus entity types. For example, the label of the token “Renal” is “B_Disease.” The details
of the BiLSTM-CRF submodel for NER are provided in Multimedia Appendix 1.

Figure 2

word feature is “Renal,” the capital feature of the initial character is “R,” the POS feature is “JJ,” and the
character representation is generated from CNN. NER: named entity recognition. CNN: convolutional
neural network. CRF: condition random field. LSTM: long short-term memory. CNN: convolutional
neural network. POS: part of speech.

BiLSTM-Attention Submodel for RE Our RE submodel is presented in Figure 3. A relation instance

can be considered as a token sequence and two target entities. Here, the token sequence did not
necessarily have to be one sentence, as we could also extract intersentence relations. For each token,
we extracted four kinds of features, namely, its word, its POS tag, and the position embeddings [63].
Here, the character representation was not used, because it reduced the performance in our preliminary
experiments. Similar to the case for NER, we employed a BiLSTM layer to generate the hidden
representations. Subsequently, the attention method [62] was used to obtain context features.

RE submodel. The target entities are “renal failure” (e1) and “antibiotics” (e2). Positions represent token
distances to the target entities. RE: relation extraction. LSTM: long short-term memory. POS: part of
speech.

Because only context features may not be enough to capture the semantic relation, we also employed
other features for concision, which are not shown in Figure 3. Considering previous work [21], these
features included words of two target entities, types of two target entities, the token number between
two target entities, and the entity number between two target entities. Like the word or POS
embeddings, these features can be represented as vectors. Therefore, the output layer considers the
concatenation of all these features to determine the relation of target entities. The details of the
BiLSTM-Attention submodel for RE are provided in Multimedia Appendix 2.
Multi-Task Learning Models
In this section, we propose three MTL models: one model used hard parameter sharing [54] and two
models used soft parameter sharing, namely, regularization [59] and task relation learning [56].
HardMTL Our MTL model for hard parameter sharing is presented in Figure 4. We employed the

shared-private architecture [64] to make each submodel of each task retain its private parts and share
some parts for multi-task learning. The NER and RE submodels had their own BiLSTM layers, namely,
LSTMner and LSTMre, and shared a BiLSTM layer, LSTMshare. During training, the shared BiLSTM
layer LSTMshare was used by both the NER and RE submodels, so that it was tuned during the backpropagation by both submodels. Therefore, the model was able to learn useful knowledge from both
tasks. The details of the HardMTL model are provided in Multimedia Appendix 3.

The high-level view of HardMTL. For conciseness, “LSTM” indicates a BiLSTM layer, and the layers
above the BiLSTM layer are denoted as Dnew and Dre. The forward procedures for an NER instance and
an RE instance are indicated by blue and green arrow lines, respectively. HardMTL: multi-task learning
model for hard parameter sharing. LSTM: long short-term-memory. BiLSTM: bidirectional long shortterm-memory. CRF: conditional random field. NER: named entity recognition. RE: relation extraction.

RegMTL Our first MTL model for soft parameter sharing was based on regularization, and its

architecture is presented in Figure 5. With reference to previous studies [59,60], we employed the L2
regularization in order to encourage the parameters of the NER and RE submodels to be similar instead
of sharing some parts in the networks. Two BiLSTM layers were considered because different inputs of
the NER and RE submodels lead to different dimensions of the first BiLSTM layer; therefore, L2
regularization of the parameters of the first BiLSTM layer was computationally intractable. We
resolved this issue by performing L2 regularization in the second BiLSTM layer. The details of the
RegMTL model are provided in Multimedia Appendix 3.

LearnMTL Our second MTL model for soft parameter sharing was based on task relation learning [56],

and its architecture is illustrated in Figure 6. After generating hidden representations from the BiLSTM
and attention layers, we used a linear layer, W5, to exchange information between the NER and RE
submodels. To utilize task-specific and shared information, the concatenation of hidden representations
of the BiLSTM and information exchange layers was fed into the upper decoders Dner and Dre. The
details of the LearnMTL model are provided in Multimedia Appendix 3.

Dataset
We used the MADE dataset from the MADE1.0 challenge for detecting medications and ADEs from
EHR notes [65]. It consists of 1089 EHR notes of patients with cancer, from which data for 18 common
Protected Health Information aspects were removed according to ﻿the Health Insurance Portability and
Accountability Act. The dataset was separated into 876 notes for training and 213 notes for testing. In
this dataset, the annotators annotated not only ADEs, but also other ADE-related information. They
predefined 9 entity types, namely, Medication, Indication, Frequency, Severity, Dosage, Duration,
Route, ADE, and SSLIF (any sign, symptom, and disease that is not an ADE or Indication). In addition,
they predefined 7 relation types between these entity types, namely, ﻿Dosage-Medication, RouteMedication, Frequency-Medication, Duration-Medication, Medication-Indication, Medication-ADE,
and Severity-ADE.

Results
The experimental settings used to obtain these results are provided in Multimedia Appendix 4.
Comparison Between Our Best Model and Existing Systems
We compared our models with the top three systems in the MADE1.0 challenge. Chapman et al [66]
used CRF for NER and random forest for RE. Specifically, two random forest models were used—one
for detecting whether relations exist between entities and the other for classifying what specific relation
type exists. Xu et al [67] used BiLSTM-CRF for NER with word, prefix, suffix, and character features.
For RE, they used SVM and designed features such as positions, distances, bag of words, and bag of

entities. Dandala et al [68] also used BiLSTM-CRF for NER, but they input different features into the
model such as words, POS tags, and characters. For RE, they employed the BiLSTM-Attention model
that takes tokens, entity types, and positions as input.
Full neural systems ([68] and our study) achieve better performances with the MADE dataset than with
other systems (Table 1). Although the main methods between the study of Dandala et al [68] and our
study are similar, our model is much better, as it significantly improved the F1 for RE by 5%. The
reasons for this superiority may be that we used more features than previous work, such as capital
information and entity words, and our model attained approximately 0.8% improvement in F1 from
MTL.

In our experiments, HardMTL successfully boosted the NER F1 by 0.4% (P=.003) and the RE F1 by
0.8% (P=.01), but RegMTL and LearnMTL failed to boost the performances. Thus, the effectiveness of
different MTL methods depends on the selected tasks and data. For heterogenous and loosely related
tasks such as NER and RE, it is more difficult for MTL to be effective.

Table 3 shows the performance of each entity type. Medication and Route (both F1>90%) were easier

Extraction of Information Related to Adverse Drug Events from Electronic Health Record Notes: Design of an End-to-End Model Based on De…

Existing systems usually selected a two-step pipeline to address ADE-related information extraction:
recognizing entities and extracting relations. BiLSTM-CRF is the most-popular model for NER,
whereas the selections of RE models are mixed. All our models outperformed the existing systems in
the MADE1.0 challenge, which may be because of the following reasons: First, our models benefited
from deep learning that is able to learn better from the data. Second, we enriched the features of deep
learning models; therefore, our model outperformed the system [68] that used similar deep learning
models as ours.
For MTL, we found that the model using hard parameter sharing (HardMTL) performed better than the
other two models using soft parameter sharing (RegMTL and LearnMTL) and that the most complex
MTL model, LearnMTL, performed the worst in our data. Our results are not surprising, as different
MTL methods depend on different tasks and data [54,56,59]. Overall, MTL more difficult between
heterogeneous and loosely related tasks such as NER and RE.
In our experiments, the entity type “ADE” and relation type “Medication-ADE” were the most difficult
information to be extracted. Based on our analysis, this is not only due to a lack of training data, but
also the intrinsic character of ADEs. ADEs are often implicit in the context without any obvious
pattern, which negatively affects the model (Example 1 in Multimedia Appendix 5). In contrast, some
entity or relation types with obvious patterns (eg, Medication-Dosage) are easier to identify (Example 2
in Multimedia Appendix 5).
Finally, we found that the performance improved when we used the pretrained word embeddings in the
biomedical domain [70] rather than those in the general domain. Furthermore, if the pretrained word
embeddings were not tuned, our models would perform better. One likely reason for this is that such a
method can alleviate the overfitting problem.
Error Analysis
We randomly sampled hundreds of error instances of NER and RE. Through the manual analyses, we
found several sources of errors. For NER, the major false-negative errors are due to long expressions of
entities (Examples 3 and 4 in Multimedia Appendix 5). These entities (eg, IgG kappa monoclonal
protein) include multiple words; therefore, it is difficult to detect their boundaries. Moreover, the major
false-positive errors for NER occur because some entity types are incorrectly recognized as SSLIF
(Examples 5 and 6 in Multimedia Appendix 5). This may be because the training instances of SSLIF
are ≥10 times those of other entity types such as ADE. Thus, imbalanced data distribution may lead to
certain bias of our models.
With respect to RE, the major false-negative errors are due to long distances between target entities
(Example 9 in Multimedia Appendix 5). The relation of two entities can be expressed through ≥6
sentences in EHRs; therefore, our model may miss such relations in a long context. In addition, the
major false-positive errors for RE occur because relation expressions exist in the instance, but are not
related to the target entities (Examples 7 and 8 in Multimedia Appendix 5). For instance, in Example 7
of Multimedia Appendix 5, “His current therapy includes [thalidomide]Entity1 50 mg a day for 2 weeks
out of the month. He had been on Velcade, which was stopped secondary to increasing [peripheral
neuropathy]Entity2, ” “peripheral neuropathy,” and “thalidomide” have no Medication-ADE relation,
but the model incorrectly predicts their relation due to the words “secondary to.”

Extraction of Information Related to Adverse Drug Events from Electronic Health Record Notes: Design of an End-to-End Model Based on De…

The main contributions of this work are as follows: (1) We proposed an up-to-date deep learning model
to perform ADE-related information extraction in an end-to-end manner. Our model achieved new
state-of-the-art performance, improving the F1 by 4.2% (absolute value). (2) To our knowledge, this is
the first attempt to investigate the impact of MTL on two heterogeneous and loosely related tasks (ie,
NER and RE). One of our MTL models further improved the F1 by 0.8% (absolute value). (3) ﻿Our
manually annotated dataset—Medication, Indication, and Adverse Drug Events (MADE) [65]—will be
publicly available to support the research on extraction of ADE-related information.
Conclusions
We proposed a deep learning model to detect ADEs and related information. We also investigated MTL
on two ADE-related tasks, NER and RE. Our models achieved state-of-the-art performance in an ADEdetection dataset. MTL can improve performance, but it depends on the methods and data used. In the
future, we plan to evaluate our models with more related datasets.
