Abstract

Objective: Health-related studies have been recently at the heart attention of the media. Social media, such as Twitter,
has become a valuable online tool to describe the early detection of various adverse drug reactions (ADRs). Different
medications have adverse effects on various cells and tissues, sometimes more than one cell population would be adversely
affected. These types of side effect are occasionally associated with the direct or indirect influence of prescribed drugs but do
not have general unfavorable mutagenic consequences on patients. This study aimed to demonstrate a quick and accurate
method to collect and classify information based on the distribution of approved data on Twitter.
Materials and Methods: In this classification method, we selected "ask a patient" dataset and combination of Twitter
"Ask a Patient" datasets that comprised of 6,623, 26,934, and 11,623 reviews. We used deep learning methods with
the word2vec to classify ADR comments posted by the users and present an architecture by HAN, FastText, and CNN.
Results: Natural language processing (NLP) deep learning is able to address more advanced peculiarity in learning
information compared to other types of machine learning. Moreover, the current study highlighted the advantage of
incorporating various semantic features, including topics and concepts.
Conclusion: Our approach predicts drug safety with the accuracy of 93% (the combination of Twitter and "Ask a
Patient" datasets) in a binary manner. Despite the apparent benefit of various conventional classifiers, deep learningbased text classification methods seem to be precise and influential tools to detect ADR.

Introduction

in different medical, public webpages or open forum such
as "Ask a Patient" website (5), Twitter, etc., provided
a powerful tool for ADR monitoring. However, the
extraction of useful information from social media is
difficult due to its writing style and language, used to
transfer this type of information. While the creation of
a proper model, as a monitoring tool typically requires
massive data and health experts, they significantly
improve ADR identification through social media, led to
the reduction in manually data labeling. Deep learning
currently achieved impressive results in addressing
the numerous NLP-related problems in this study. In
this study, we collected quite various comments and
automatically processed them using a deep learning
method.

Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are defined as the side
effect of medications on health care. A systematic review
of 25 prospective observational studies demonstrated
that 5.3% of patients have been dealing with ADRs (1).
Thus, early detection of these events probably would
have an incredible impact on human health. According to
the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality report,
annually, over 770,000 of people have been hurt and/or
even passed away in hospitals due to the consequence
of ADRs (2). Hence, societies require an alternative
approach to detect ADRs related to clinical medications.
Economically, ADRs noticeably increases the expenses of
hospitalization (3, 4).
In this context, social media provide a considerable
amount of information to detect ADRs, using the NLP
technique. One of these social media is Twitter, which is a
good source of data for broad-spectrum issues, particularly
ADR-related discussions and posts. Currently, Twitter
has the record of daily 342,000,000 active and 135,000
registered users. It has been revealed that the majority of
patients positively shared the data about their health status

generating advanced NLP-based information for accurate
ADR sentence detection and data classification through a
traditional approach like Naïve Bayes, Maximum Entropy,
and Support Vector Machine.

method, whose function is associated with both left and
right context in all layers. Also, pre-trained BERT does
only need to be adapted with one additional output layer
to become capable of various tasks, which indicates the
simplicity and flexibility of BERT.

These methods presented an annotated Twitter corpus
detection based on ADR as a general keyword. Sarker
and Gonzalez applied two supervised machine learning
approaches (NB and SVM) on a broad range of
annotated medications with regard to ADR tweets (7).
Although the classifier shows moderate performance,
it was considered a fundamental method for further
development of advanced techniques. In line with this
approach, Akhtyamova et al. (8) applied convolutional
neural networks (CNN) model, built in word2vec for
classification of Twitter comments.

Taken together, due to the imbalanced Twitter data in
this suggested approach, we combined datasets which
improved the accuracy of classification. We analyzed the
accuracy of three different deep learning classifiers and
found that the accuracy of each model strictly depends
on the type of data. In these three models, various hyperparameters were analyzed by applying different batches in
epoch 100. We discovered that the exact identification of
the learning rate is impossible to be determined because of
variations in learning rate among different batch numbers
and the way that datasets are distributed. Therefore, these
models are unable to identify ADR-related comments in
social media such as Twitter, and we analyzed recognition
speeds in all three models, which has not been conducted
in previous studies.

Also, Lee et al. (9) suggested a partially supervised
CNN framework to classify the report of the inauspicious
incidence of medication on Twitter. A Twitter dataset is
not only used for the task associated with public service
broadcasting (PSB) 2016 social medium but also applied
to evaluate the model, which induces a high-performance
classification of adverse drug event (ADE) with +9.9% F1Score. Notably, the ADE detection surveillance systems
require a small number of labeled instances. Moreover,
the introduced model by Tiftikci et al. (10) consisted of
CNN, conditional random fields (CRF), bi-directional
long- and short-term memory (Bi-LSTM), and the
alternative part which has the function of ADR detection.
In other words, the ML-based approach first detects the
ADRs and then normalizes them to MedDRA Preferred
Terms through a rule-based method and dictionary. The
F1 scores their introduced model to detect and normalize
tasks, and they were 76.97% and 82.58%. The increased
spectrum to precisely identify more items in the text was
also considered in their model.

Materials and Methods
Study design
The classification methods research consists of five
steps (Fig.1), starting with data input from three different
databases, followed by pre-processing of the data to
improve quality of texts, cross-validation tests (grouping
input data into train and test category), and classification
by deep learning algorithms at the final stage.
Data sources

Akhtyamova et al. (11) presented a CNN-based
architecture, consisting of numerous parameters to predict
ADRs based on the number of votes. With regard to the
evaluation of the performance of the model, they utilized
a broad-spectrum medical dataset derived from medical
websites. In contrast to previous reports of networks,
the proposed end-to-end model does not need artificial
attribute and information pre-processing, which ends up
with an enormous improvement in standard CNN-based
methods.

As shown in Table 1, in order to find input datasets,
6623 comments out of 10822 ones were extracted (14),
resulting in an imbalanced data between ADR and nonADR, and generation of poor Kappa coefficient. In order
to overcome this challenge, we combined ADR comments
on Twitter with "Ask a patient" datasets (5). According to
the importance of special side effects in posted comments,
we compared these two datasets to evaluate the method.
Regarding the registration of special side effects posted in
comments, we used these datasets to compare comments
with Twitter whose range of perspectives is quite broad,
and then evaluated the method.

Finally, Devlin et al. (12) pointed out Bidirectional
Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT)

complexity parameters to achieve the highest prediction
of performance. Also, we classified all information based
on the evaluation, validation, and training sub-database.
However, the actual data resources are restricted in the
case of testing and training; this result would end-up with
the growth of generalized mistakes. The strategy of crossvalidation benefit decline of the generalized mistakes and
prevent data overlapping. Data distribution for each group
is shown in Table 2.

The pre-processing of comments in both datasets was
performed as follows:
1. Data shuffling
2. Converting all uppercase words into lowercase
3. Elimination of special characters such as @, !, /, *, $, etc.
4. Remove stop word: at, of, the, …
5. Correction of words with repeated characters including
pleaseeeeeeeeee and/or yessss
6. Convert acronym or abbreviation to complete form
like: "I’m" "I am"
7. Lemmatization: for example, "I started taking almost two
months ago,"  "I started to take almost two months ago."

Deep classification
The methods of data classification include CNN (13),
HNN (15), and FastText (16) with similar word2vec
section. Then word2vec is generated to proceed into
further steps.

Error handling
It is required to deal with several challenges to work
with Twitter data. The purpose suggested a deep
learning approach to use the model for ADR detection
automatically; therefore, the following errors were
resolved in the pre-processing phase.

Convolutional neural network method
The CNN architecture for sentence classification is
composed of three different filter region size; 2, 3 and 4,
and each region contains two sub-filters. Filters fold the
sentence matrix and generate (variable- length) features
maps. One-maximum pooling generates over each map,
resulting in six univariate feature vectors. Finally, these
six features are connected to each other to form a feature
vector for the penultimate layer. Once the feature vector
develops, it will be used as input data in the final softmax
to classify sentences into two possible output states (13).

In this section, we considered the leading causes of
classification errors in these two datasets and discussed
potential approaches to solve these challenges. The
common causes of misclassifications are:
Non-standard terms of English: The broad-spectrum
ADR description is explained by non-medical related
terms, which are very rare and unrepeated in posts.
Hence, the majority of classifiers are unable to capture
these posts.

Hierarchical Attention Network method
Hierarchical Attention Network (HAN) has two
distinctive characteristics: i. A hierarchical structure and ii.
Two levels of the word and sentence sensitivity, enabling
the network to differentially participate in somewhat
valuable content at the time of representing any designed
document. Also, the HAN network is made of quite a few
parts, including word/sentences-level attention layers and
sequence encoder. HAN works based on this thought that
sentence and documents structure in modeling plays a
decisive role in better proper representation of document
structure. In fact, the directional models read the text input
sequentially (left-to-right or right-to-left). Conversely, the
transformer encoder reads the entire sequence of words,
once. Therefore, it is considered bidirectional. Actually, it
would be more accurate to say that it is non-directional.
This characteristic allows the model to learn the context

Short posts: A large number of posts are small sentences
and composed of very few medical terms. These types of
posts increase the rate of misclassification.
A large proportion of spelling errors: The majority
of posts consists of a series of grammatical errors and
typos. Thus, these posts not only negatively contribute to
lexicon/topic scores, but also are mistaken with non-ADR
groups.
Cross-validation
In the majority of the category of models, the
complication of the network would be managed by many
factors.
In this study, we figured out an appropriate value of the

of a word-based on all of its surroundings (left and right
of the word).

Kappa: This criterion is often employed to test the
reliability of the viewer and to compare the accuracy of
the system in terms of how much the generated output is
coincident.

FastText method
This method proposes a simple and efficient approach
for classification of the texts and its expression. A large
amount of research shows that the rapid classification
of text with this method is faster than deep learning in
terms of accuracy and using commands for training
and evaluation. Basically, two major and influential
differences are considered in this regard:

Result
Usage model
In this study, we benefited from user’s comments posted
on Twitter and “Ask a Patient” to extract side effects of
drugs. In the field of deep learning, the following issues
are considered in the training phase. Generally, the size
of a window that moves on texts in both FastText and
HAN methods is called Pad_Seq_Len, and usually, the
maximum size of tweets and comments is 150 where the
length of sentences and semantic conjugation are essential.
The Embedding_dim value of 100 was considered for the
creation of Word2Vec. We evaluated several optimizations,
such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), RMS prob,
etc. Among them, Adam showed better results.

Softmax: is a hierarchy, based on the Huffman encoded
tree structure that reduces Time Complexity O (Kd) to O
(d log k) in which K is the number of targets, D is the
hidden layer dimension.
N-gram attributes: the pool of words have a fixed number
of words; however, occasionally, putting this order clearly
into consideration costs a lot in terms of computer work.
Instead, we used n-gram pool as an extra attribute to
obtain data with regard to the sequence of words, locally.
Evaluation metrics

Implementation method

Precision (positive predictive value) and recall
(sensitivity): These metrics are an appropriate fraction
of retrieved samples from all and relevant instances. The
application of these metrics depends on understanding
and measuring relevance.

We used NVIDIA GEFORCE GTX 1050 and CPU
Intel Core i7 hardware in our study. Three methods of
classification were applied against three different data
groups, listed in Table 3. In each method, the learning
rate and batch size were evaluated, and different criteria
have been tested for each type of model according to the
type of data. For example, FastText method covered 64
samples in each batch, and the rate of learning was 0.1 on
Twitter datasets, resulting in the highest accuracy (0.927).
As shown in Table 3, the best value for each dataset in
different methods has been highlighted.

Accuracy: This criterion is the accuracy of the x-group
classification against all items where the x-tag is suggested
by means of classification for recorded investigation. This
criterion indicates how much the output of classification
would be reliable.
F-measure: This criterion is a combination of call
metrics and accuracy, and it is used to find out if it is

'Learning rate': It is a kind of the hyper-parameter which
regulates the level of adjusted weight in our network in
association with gradient.

Table 3 shows the results of 3 different dataset
analyses, using 3 different methods of deep learning.
At first glance, a significant difference between
accuracy and Kappa ratio is observed. The results
show the highest accuracy rate (0.927) versus learning
rate and a batch with the size of 0.1 and 64. However,
the Kappa value does not represent a satisfactory
result, and the weak value of Kappa is mainly due to
an imbalanced distribution of Twitter data.

Large batch sizes in comparison with small ones
produce more states of similarity, while latter meet lower
training span; thus, the latter seems to have better efficacy,
in terms of computational perspectives.

Discussion

In order to overcome this challenge, we pooled ADRrelated data of both "Ask a patient" and Twitter. Compared
to CNN and FastText, a significant precision degree in
HAN was 0.930 T, the rate of learning and batch size were
0.001 and 128. We found a direct correlation between
the balanced number of documents and the accuracy of
classification in each category that presented in (Fig.2).
We analyzed speed recognition features of three models
based on the best result of Table 3 and Figure 3.

The approach of this study was to group processing and
challenges into adverse drug events into ADR and nonADR classes and analyze them using deep learning as a
tool.
In this model, we suggested three methods for preprocessing of data analyses, i.e., cleaning/removing
URLs, emoji, and hashtags, which are recommended
based on data shuffling. The ADR recognition was
accomplished through various features extraction
networks such as HAN, FastText, and CNN.
Finally, the obtained preliminary results of drug
classifications were applicable for confusion matrices
and consequently interpreted by means of measuring
accuracy and false positive ratio. We used numerous
deep learning methods for text classification.
Compared to current deep learning-based networks,
our results showed that the FastText, CNN, and HAN
were much faster and more accurate.
Furthermore, in comparison with unsupervised
trained word vectors, the word vector, developed in
our models, would be incorporated to generate an
appropriate sentence representation (6). According
to deep learning models, we suggested the approach
of end-to-end, in which artificial attribute and
preprocessed information are not necessary. The
obtained results demonstrated that the proposed
models would significantly improve the performance
of baseline methods for different datasets.

Fig.2: Accuracy of classification in three datasets.

We noticed that increasing batch size during training
steps considerably reduced the learning rate in the network.
Conversely, we tested various optimizers including SGD,
RMS, and Adam in datasets, "Ask a patient" dataset, and
found that Adam shows better results compared to RMS
and SGD.
Conclusion
All in all, the main focus of this study was on Twitter
data. However, we added some data from other public
databases for scientific comparisons. The obtained results
highlighted that the combination of "Ask a patient," and
Twitter datasets significantly improved the accuracy of
classification. Furthermore, pooling ADR training data
for "Ask a patient", and Twitter datasets showed a slight
improvement in classification.

In the following Table, we compared epochs and groups
against various hyper-parameters of learning rate.
The best performance was highlighted in Table 3.
'Epoch': It means that how many times our model
should be trained.

These results suggest that normalized datasets in
terms of type and structure of sentences are able to
be merged as a training dataset. "Ask a patient", and

'Batch size': It refers to how many data records that one

In order to measure the compatibility of text, several
features have been considered, including the indication of
topics, ADRs, and concepts. We used two categories of data
to detect medication side effects and to generate and analyze

that using large batch size not only significantly improves
efficacy and accuracy of classification, but also reduces the
number of required parameters, updated for model training,
which consequently decrease training time.
