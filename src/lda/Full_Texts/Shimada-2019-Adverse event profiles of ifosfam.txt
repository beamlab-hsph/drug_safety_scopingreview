Abstract
Purpose Ifosfamide is extensively used to treat several malignant conditions. Administration of ifosfamide can cause
encephalopathy and other neurotoxic effects. The aim of this study was to obtain novel information on the onset profiles of
ifosfamide-induced encephalopathy (IIE) considering other associated clinical factors using the US Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) and the Japanese Adverse Drug Event Report (JADER) databases.
Methods We analyzed the reports of encephalopathy between 2004 and 2018 from the FAERS and JADER databases. To
define IIE, we used the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) preferred terms and standardized queries.
The reporting odds ratios (ROR) at 95% confidence interval (CI) was used to detect the signal for IIE and adjusted for covariates using a multivariate logistic regression technique. We evaluated the time-to-onset profile of IIE and used the association
rule mining technique to discover undetected associations, such as potential risk factors.
Results In the FAERS database, the ROR (CI) for encephalopathy (preferred term, PT) and encephalopathy (standardized
MedDRA queries, SMQ) was 56.58 (51.69–61.93) and 1.57 (1.48–1.67), respectively. In the JADER database, the ROR (95%
CI) for encephalopathy (PT) and encephalopathy (SMQ) was 13.54 (9.91–18.50) and 1.24 (1.01–1.53), respectively. The
multivariate logistic regression analysis showed a significant contribution in IIE signal in the ≥ 60 year group (p = 0.00094;
vs. < 60 year group) and ≥ 2000 mg/m2 dosage group (p = 0.00045; vs. < 2000 mg/m2 dosage group). The association rules
of {ifosfamide, aprepitant} → {encephalopathy (SMQ)} demonstrated high lift values. The average dose of ifosfamide in
patients with encephalopathy (PT) and without encephalopathy (PT) was 2022.8 ± 592.8 (mean ± standard deviation) and
1568.5 ± 703.2 mg/m2, respectively (p < 0.05). Encephalopathy within the first 7 days of ifosfamide administration was 94.1%
for encephalopathy (PT) and 87.7% for encephalopathy (SMQ), respectively.
Conclusions The present analysis demonstrated that the incidence of encephalopathy with ifosfamide should be closely
monitored for a short onset (within 7 days). The patients who are administered a high dose of ifosfamide or co-administrated
aprepitant should be carefully monitored for the development of encephalopathy.

Ifosfamide is extensively used to treat several malignancies
[1]. Administration of ifosfamide can cause encephalopathy and other neurotoxic effects [2]. It has been proposed
that chloroacetaldehyde produced from ifosfamide may
cause encephalopathy, although its mechanism has not been

elucidated [3]. The known risk factors of ifosfamide-induced
encephalopathy (IIE) are as follows: poor performance status (PS), serum creatinine level, albumin level, hemoglobin
level, 4 or 5 successive days of ifosfamide administration,
and leptomeningeal metastasis [4–7]. It has been reported
that ifosfamide-induced neurotoxicity occurs within a few
hours to few days after the first administration of ifosfamide,
and in most cases, it resolves within 48–72 h of discontinuation of the drug. However, it may persist for a longer period
[8]. The detailed time-to-onset profiles of IIE are not clear
in clinical settings.
The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has developed the FDA adverse event reporting system (FAERS) that
is the best-known spontaneous reporting system (SRS) in the
world. The Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency
(PMDA), a regulatory authority in Japan, has released the
Japanese Adverse Drug Event Report (JADER) database.
The aim of this study was to assess IIE by analyzing data
from the SRS databases. In pharmacovigilance analysis, data
mining algorithms have been developed to identify drugassociated adverse events (AEs) as signals using reporting
odds ratio (ROR). We evaluated the possible relationship
among reporting year, sex, age, and dosage of ifosfamide
for IIE using adjusted RORs and a multivariate logistic
regression technique. We obtained novel information on the
time-to-onset profiles of IIE in the JADER database. Furthermore, association rule mining has been proposed as a
new analytical method to identify undetected relationships
such as possible risk factors between variables in the SRS
databases [9, 10]. We applied the association rule mining
technique to detect association rules between IIE and several
clinical factors.

Materials and methods
The SRS such as FAERS and the JADER are publicly
available and can be downloaded from the FDA website
(www.fda.gov) and the PMDA website (www.pmda.go.jp),
respectively. All data from the SRS database were fully
anonymized by the regulatory authorities before use in the
present analysis. We assessed the incidence of “encephalopathy” in the FAERS database from January 2004 to
September 2018 and the JADER database from April 2004
to June 2018. We followed the FDA recommendations for
excluding duplicate reports of patients and used the most
recent case numbers to identify and exclude such records
from the analyses [11].
The AEs in this study relied on the definition provided
in the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA)/Japanese (MedDRA/J, www.pmrj.jp/jmo/php/index​
j.php) version 19.0. The standardized MedDRA Queries
(SMQs) index consists of groupings of MedDRA terms

ordinarily at the preferred term (PT) level that relates to a
defined medical condition or area of interest. To evaluate the
effects of ifosfamide on encephalopathy, we used encephalopathy (PT) (defined by PT code: 10014625) and SMQ for
noninfectious encephalopathy/delirium (defined by SMQ
code: 20000133, including 350 PTs).
We investigated the dose-dependency of ifosfamide using
the JADER database. We estimated the daily ifosfamide dosage per square meter (mg/m2) according to the amount of
drug administered daily, body weight, and height against
each case in the JADER database. Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves are used in medicine to determine
cutoff values for a clinical test. We applied the ROC curves
to determine the cutoff of dosage of ifosfamide for encephalopathy (PT) and encephalopathy (SMQ). The area under
an ROC curve (AUC) is a common measure of accuracy
of a diagnostic test; however, it does not specify the “optimal” cutoff value directly. Youden index is often used to
determine the optimal cutoff value (optimal decision threshold). The formula for Youden index is as follows: Youden
index = sensitivity + specificity − 1. Higher values of Youden
index are better than lower values [12]. Furthermore, we
compared the dosage of ifosfamide between patients with
and without encephalopathy using Student t test.
To detect the AE signal, we calculated the ROR, which is
established for pharmacovigilance using a disproportionality
analysis [13]. Signals are considered significant when the
ROR estimates and the lower limits of the corresponding
95% confidence interval (CI) are > 1.
Using the ROR allowed adjustments using a multivariate
logistic regression analysis and offered the advantage of controlling covariates [14]. To calculate the adjusted ROR, only
reports with complete information of reporting year, sex,
age, and ifosfamide dosage were extracted from the JADER
database. To construct the multivariate logistic model, the
following formula was used for analysis:

Log (odds) = 𝛽0 + 𝛽1 Y + 𝛽2 S + 𝛽3 A + 𝛽4 D,
where, Y is the reporting year (2004–2008, 2009–2013, and
2014–2018), S is the sex, A is the age-stratified group (< 60
and ≥ 60 years), and D is the dosage-stratified group (< 2000
and ≥ 2000 mg/m2). To comparatively evaluate the effect of
variables, we selected explanatory variables using a stepwise method [15, 16] at a significance level of 0.05 (forward
and backward). The contribution of selected variables in the
final model was evaluated. The ROR was adjusted using the
multivariate logistic regression model. A likelihood ratio
test was used to evaluate the effects of explanatory variables.
Association rule mining is focused on finding frequent co-occurring associations among a collection of
items. Given a set of transactions T (each transaction is
a set of items), an association rule can be expressed as X
[lhs: left-hand-side, the antecedent of the rule] → Y [rhs:

Cancer Chemotherapy and Pharmacology (2019) 84:1097–1105

right-hand-side, the consequent of the rule]; where, X and
Y are mutually exclusive sets of items [17]. Support, confidence, and lift were used as indicators to evaluate the
association rule. The support of the rule is defined as the
percentage of transactions in T that contains both X and
Y [18]. The support was measured using the following
formula:

Support = P(X ∩ Y) = {X ∩ Y}∕{D},
where, D is the total number of transactions in the database.
The confidence of the association rule is the ratio of the
support of the itemset X ∩ Y to the support of the itemset
X, which roughly corresponds to the conditional probability P(Y|X) [18]. Because the confidence is an indicator of
accuracy of related rules, an association rule with high confidence is critical. The formula for calculating confidence
is as follows:

Confidence = P(X ∩ Y)∕P(X).
Lift is the ratio between the confidence of the rule and
support of the itemset in the consequent of the rule. It is
calculated as follows:

Lift = P(X ∩ Y)∕P(X) P(Y).
The lift evaluates the independence of X and Y, suggesting that the greater the lift value, the stronger the relationship. If X and Y are independent, the lift is 1. If X and Y
are positively or negatively correlated, the lift is > 1 or < 1,
respectively.
The association rule mining was performed using the
apriori function of the arules library in the arules package
of R software (version 3.3.3). The parameter of maxlen
(maximum length of itemset/rule: a parameter in the arules
package) is the maximum size of mined frequent itemsets. To extract association rules efficiently, the thresholds of the optimized support, confidence, and maxlen
are defined depending on factors such as the size of data,
number of items, and purpose of research. In this study,
we defined the minimum support and confidence thresholds as 0.00001 and 0.001, respectively, and maxlen was
restricted to 3.
Time-to-onset from the JADER database was calculated
from the beginning of the time of a subject’s first prescription to the occurrence of AEs. We excluded reports that
did not have complete information on AE occurrence and
prescription initiation time. It was necessary to consider
the right truncation when evaluating the time of onset of
AEs. We selected an analysis period of 180 days after the
initiation of drug administration. The median, quartiles,
and Weibull shape parameter (WSP) were utilized while
evaluating the time-to-onset data [19, 20]. The shape
parameter β of Weibull distribution indicated that the hazard was without a reference population. When β was equal

1099

to 1, the hazard was estimated to be constant over time
and if β was > 1 and the 95% CI of β excluded the value 1,
the hazard was considered to increase over time [19, 20].

Results
The FAERS database contained 11,527,468 reports. After
excluding the duplicates according to the FDA recommendation, 9,702,166 reports were analyzed, of which 6.3%
(523/8344 cases) and 14.7% (1226/8344 cases) AE cases
related to ifosfamide corresponded to encephalopathy (PT)
and encephalopathy (SMQ), respectively (Table 1). The
ROR (95% CI) for encephalopathy (PT) and encephalopathy (SMQ) was 56.58 (51.69–61.93) and 1.57 (1.48–1.67),
respectively. The JADER database contained 534,688
reports. The number of AE reports corresponding to
encephalopathy (PT) and encephalopathy (SMQ) was 3.5%
(42/1198 cases) and 7.9% (95/1198 cases) (Table 1). The
ROR (95% CI) for encephalopathy (PT) and encephalopathy (SMQ) was 13.54 (9.91–18.50) and 1.24 (1.01–1.53),
respectively.
The AUC from ROC curve for encephalopathy (PT) and
encephalopathy (SMQ) was 0.675 and 0.602, respectively.
The cutoff value for encephalopathy (PT) and encephalopathy (SMQ) was 2000 (Youden index = 0.307) and 2000 mg/
m2 (Youden index = 0.197), respectively.
Using a stepwise logistic regression model, we examined and selected significant variables related to IIE among
the background factors (sex, age-stratified group), reporting year, and dosage-stratified group. The result in the final
model indicated a significant contribution of the ≥ 60 year
group (p = 0.00094) and ≥ 2000 mg/m 2 dosage group
(p = 0.00045) to encephalopathy (SMQ). The contribution of sex and reporting year to encephalopathy (SMQ)
was not significant (data not shown). The adjusted ROR of
the ≥ 60 year group was 2.14 (1.37–3.34) compared with
that of the control < 60 year group that was used as a reference. The adjusted ROR of the ≥ 2000 mg/m2 dosage
group was 2.15 (1.43–3.25) compared with that of the reference < 2000 mg/m2 dosage group. However, the contribution
of all the examined variables (sex, age, reporting year, and
dosage) to encephalopathy (PT) was not significant (data
not shown).
We classified the reports according to the daily dose
as follows: < 2000 (337 reports) and ≥ 2000 mg/m2 (139
reports). The reporting ratio of encephalopathy (PT) in
the < 2000 and ≥ 2000 mg/m2 groups was 3.9% (13 reports)
and 15.8% (22 reports), respectively. For encephalopathy
(SMQ), the reporting ratio of encephalopathy in the < 2000
and ≥ 2000 mg/m2 groups was 8.0% (27 reports) and 19.4%
(27 reports), respectively. The average dose of ifosfamide for
cases with encephalopathy (PT) and without encephalopathy

(PT) was 2022.8 ± 592.8 (mean ± standard deviation) and
1568.5 ± 703.2 mg/m2, respectively (p < 0.05). The average dose of ifosfamide for encephalopathy (SMQ) and
without encephalopathy (SMQ) was 1836.4 ± 726.6 and
1573.1 ± 699.3 mg/m2, respectively (p < 0.05).
We evaluated the possible associations between IIE and
demographic data. The result of the mining algorithm was a
set of 12 and 20 rules for encephalopathy (PT) and encephalopathy (SMQ) (Table 2). The association rules of {ifosfamide, osteosarcoma} → {encephalopathy (PT)} and {ifosfamide, aprepitant} → {encephalopathy (SMQ)} demonstrated
high lift values (Table 2).
For the time-to-onset analysis, we extracted combinations that had complete information for the date of treatment

initiation and the date of onset of AE. The median duration
(interquartile range) for encephalopathy caused by ifosfamide in patients with encephalopathy (PT) and encephalopathy (SMQ) was 3.0 (2.0–5.0) and 3.0 (1.0–5.0) days,
respectively (Fig. 1). Encephalopathy within the first 7 days
of administration of ifosfamide was 94.1% for encephalopathy (PT) and 87.7% for encephalopathy (SMQ).

Discussion
In this study, we evaluated the relationship between ifosfamide and encephalopathy using data from the SRS databases.

Fig. 1  Time-to-onset profiles of ifosfamide-induced encephalopathy in the JADER database. a Defined by preferred term (PT) of

MedDRA Queries (SMQ) of noninfectious encephalopathy/delirium
(SMQ code: 20000133)

(PT and SMQ) was > 1 in both SRS databases, our results
suggest that ifosfamide increases the incidence of encephalopathy. Central nervous system toxicity was observed in
10–30% of ifosfamide-treated patients [21]. These results
also corresponded with those of previous reports.
The results of the multivariate logistic regression analysis
indicated the risk of aging and higher dose of ifosfamide for
encephalopathy (SMQ). It has been reported that the laboratory values of increased serum creatinine increase the IIE
risk [5, 6]. Aging decreases renal drug elimination because
of reduced glomerular filtration rate and tubular function
[22]. We considered that the evaluation of IIEs related
to aging and associated with renal disorders would be an
extremely interesting subject. On the contrary, we could not
observe the effects of aging and higher dose of ifosfamide
for encephalopathy (PT). The reason might be the small
number of reporting case for encephalopathy (PT) in our
used data set of the JADER (Table 1).
Previously, the high cumulative dose has been proposed
as a risk factor of encephalopathy [23]. On the contrary,
some studies have reported that a high cumulative dose is not
a risk factor [24]. From the results of the multivariate logistic regression analysis and from the comparison of the average dose of ifosfamide in patients with encephalopathy (PT)
and without encephalopathy (PT), we have demonstrated
the possibility of an increased risk of encephalopathy with

a higher dose of ifosfamide. From the AUC and Youden
index in the ROC curves, encephalopathy (PT) might be a
more stringent criterion than encephalopathy (SMQ). Robust
epidemiological studies are required to throw light on this
risk factor.
To the best of our knowledge, there have been no previous reports on association rule mining analyses for IIE
using SRS. The association rule mining revealed that the
incidence of encephalopathy (SMQ) with primary diseaserelated items such as aprepitant was high because of the lift
values of two combined items. An association between IIE
and aprepitant is commonly accepted [25–27]. Therefore, we
believe that aprepitant might be associated with the risk of
IIE. Ifosfamide has been a part of various treatment protocols such as osteosarcoma (MAPIE protocol: cisplatin, doxorubicin, methotrexate, ifosfamide, and etoposide) and nonHodgkin’s lymphoma (MINE protocol: mesna, ifosfamide,
mitoxantrone, and etoposide). Therefore, the lift value of
combined item of ifosfamide and osteosarcoma, ifosfamide
and other anticancer drug such as etoposide, doxorubicin,
mesna, and etoposide might be apparently high. Further
epidemiological studies might be required to confirm these
results.
Methylene blue, thiamin, and dexmedetomidine are
known to prevent and treat IIE [28–31]. In patients with
encephalopathy (PT) and encephalopathy (SMQ), we

13

Cancer Chemotherapy and Pharmacology (2019) 84:1097–1105

preliminary analyzed the number of cases in which ifosfamide and these drugs (methylene blue, dexmedetomidine,
and thiamin) were used in combination. In the JADER
database, no reports in which ifosfamide and concomitant
drugs such as methylene blue, dexmedetomidine, and thiamin were used in combination for encephalopathy (PT) and
encephalopathy (SMQ). In the FAERS database, there were
no reports on the combination of ifosfamide and methylene
blue or thiamin for encephalopathy (PT). The combination
of ifosfamide and methylene blue was 0.2% (19/8344) for
encephalopathy (SMQ). The combination of ifosfamide and
thiamin was 0.2% (17/8344) for encephalopathy (SMQ).
There were no reports on the combination of ifosfamide
and dexmedetomidine for encephalopathy (PT) and encephalopathy (SMQ). The effect of the treatment with methylene
blue, thiamin, and dexmedetomidine is clinically interesting. However, as the number of reports of the combination
therapy was small, we did not examine further.
It has been reported that IIE occurs more frequently
after oral administration rather than infusion. IIE might be
affected by the administration route of drugs. For example, cyclophosphamide has two dosage forms, namely, oral
and intravenous. However, ifosfamide is administered by
intravenous form. In the JADER database, no case of oral
administration was reported. In the FAERS, the input of oral
administration was only 0.1% (11/8344).
We also applied time-to-onset analysis to validate the
results, which provided novel insights into the time-to-onset
of encephalopathy. That is, > 40% of the encephalopathy
cases were observed within 3 days in the real-world data set,
and > 80% of the reports on encephalopathy following the
administration of ifosfamide were recorded within 7 days of
treatment initiation. However, ifosfamide-induced encephalopathy occurring after day 7 of drug administration should
not be overlooked.
In this study, we applied the time-to-onset analysis. After
extraction of the combinations with complete information
on the date of starting medication and the date of AE onset,
time-to-onset duration was calculated from the beginning
of a subject’s first prescription to the occurrence of AEs. In
the FAERS, matching between the date of AE onset and the
date of starting treatment of each individual drug is difficult
because the information date for each drug was not recorded
in the FAERS. Therefore, we used the JADER database for
the time-to-onset analysis in this study.
Our study has some limitations that are worth mentioning. First, the FAERS and JADER databases do not contain
detailed background information on medical history (e.g.,
treatment regimen). It was difficult to obtain and evaluate
the accurate dosage and duration of the drug from, and
the duration of neurotoxicity and/or encephalopathy. For
example, in the JADER and the FAERS, the percentage
of items for which some dosage data has been entered was

1103

55.3% (913/1650) and 41.7% (4099/9840), respectively. In
the FAERS database, the description format of the field of
“DOSE_VBM” that is verbatim text for dose, frequency,
and route, as entered in reports was not unified and trouble in interpretation. On the contrary, the input of the dose
and frequency of administration in the JADER database
was relatively standardized. Furthermore, other information such as body weight was limited in the FAERS compared with that in the JADER. We have already reported
the AE analysis with the daily dosage of Kampo preparation according to the amount administered daily in each
case report using the JADER database [32]. Therefore, we
evaluated using the JADER database and did not evaluate
using the FAERS database. Second, the SRS is subject to
over-reporting, under-reporting, missing data, exclusion of
healthy individuals, lack of a denominator, and presence
of confounding factors [33]. The “Weber effect” is a wellknown limitation in the spontaneous reporting of AEs. The
Weber effect is an epidemiological phenomenon describing
AE-reporting peaks at the end of the second year after a
regulatory authority approves a drug, which then plateaus
and eventually declines [34, 35]. However, the Weber effect
was not always observed [35]. Based on our results using the
multivariate logistic regression analysis, the clear decline
in the reporting ratio was not observed during 2004–2018.
The comparison study demonstrated distinct discrepancies in reported drugs, reported AEs, seriousness, and average number of reported events per case, between the JADER
and FAERS [36]. As differences can arise as a result of discrepancies in reporting rules and customs in each country
such as reporters and reported AE terms, which are associated in regulations, the two databases showed different features [36]. For example, the SRS databases mostly depend
on the compliance of pharmaceutical companies to report
according to regulatory requirements. Companies in the
US need to submit case reports with non-serious AEs, but
reporting of known non-serious AEs is not mandatory for
Japanese companies [36]. Therefore, it is difficult to directly
compare the RORs of the FAERS with those of the JADER.
However, we could demonstrate the same trend among each
database as follows: the crude RORs of encephalopathy were
higher than 1 in both the databases. Information from both
databases might be considered of complementary value.

Conclusions
This is the first study to evaluate the correlation between
ifosfamide and encephalopathy using an SRS analysis strategy. Despite the limitations inherent to SRS, we showed
the potential risk of encephalopathy with ifosfamide use
in a real-life setting. The present analysis demonstrated
that patients administered ifosfamide should be closely

13

1104

monitored for the development of encephalopathy within a
short duration (7 days). The patients who are administered
with a high dose of ifosfamide or co-administrated aprepitant should also be carefully monitored for the development
of encephalopathy.
