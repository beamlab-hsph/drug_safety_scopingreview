Background: Quadrivalent live attenuated inﬂuenza vaccine (LAIV4) was approved in 2012 for healthy
persons aged 2–49 years. Beginning with the 2013–2014 inﬂuenza season, LAIV4 replaced trivalent live
attenuated inﬂuenza vaccine (LAIV3).
Methods: We analyzed LAIV4 reports to VAERS, a national spontaneous reporting system. LAIV4 reports in
2013–2014 were compared to LAIV3 reports from the previous three inﬂuenza seasons. Medical records
were reviewed for non-manufacturer serious reports (i.e., death, hospitalization, prolonged hospitalization, life-threatening illness, permanent disability) and reports of selected conditions of interest. We
conducted Empirical Bayesian data mining to identify disproportional reporting for LAIV4.
Results: In 2013–2014, 12.7 million doses of LAIV4 were distributed and VAERS received 779 reports in
individuals aged 2–49 years; 95% were non-serious. Expired drug administered (42%), fever (13%) and
cough (8%) were most commonly reported in children aged 2–17 years when LAIV4 was administered
alone, while headache (18%), expired drug administered (15%) and exposure during pregnancy (12%)
were most common in adults aged 18–49 years. We identiﬁed one death report in a child who died from
complications of cerebellar vascular tumors. Among non-death serious reports, neurologic conditions
were common in children and adults. In children, seizures (3) and Guillain-Barré syndrome (2) were
the most common serious neurologic outcomes. We identiﬁed three serious reports of asthma/wheezing
following LAIV4 in children. Data mining detected disproportional reporting for vaccine administration
errors and for inﬂuenza illness in children.
Conclusions: Our analysis of VAERS reports for LAIV4 did not identify any concerning patterns. The data
mining ﬁnding for reports of inﬂuenza illness is consistent with low LAIV4 vaccine effectiveness observed
for inﬂuenza A disease in children in 2013–2014. Reports of LAIV4 administration to persons in whom
the vaccine is not recommended (e.g., pregnant women) indicate the need for education, training and
screening regarding indications.

2012 [1,2]. Beginning with the 2013–2014 inﬂuenza season, LAIV4
replaced trivalent live attenuated inﬂuenza vaccine (LAIV3) and
was included in the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) seasonal inﬂuenza vaccine recommendations [3]. LAIV4
is recommended for healthy persons aged 2–49 years who have
no contraindications or precautions; it is not recommended for
pregnant women and persons with certain underlying medical
conditions [4,5]. LAIV4 includes two inﬂuenza A viruses and two
inﬂuenza B viruses. In pre-licensure clinical trials [6–8], rates of
solicited adverse events (AEs) after LAIV4 were similar to LAIV3;
however, fever ≥38 ◦ C (100.4 ◦ F) was more common in children
aged 2–8 years during days 0–10 after dose 1 following LAIV4 compared to LAIV3 (5.1% vs 3.1%) [8].

P. Haber et al. / Vaccine 33 (2015) 1987–1992

During its ﬁrst season of use, the same contraindications and
precautions that were previously applied to LAIV3 were also
applied to LAIV4 [4]. We analyzed reports to the Vaccine Adverse
Event Reporting System (VAERS) following LAIV4 from July 1, 2013
through June 30, 2014, and compared the safety of LAIV4 to LAIV3
from recent previous inﬂuenza seasons.
2. Methods
2.1. Data source
VAERS, co-administered by the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC) and FDA, is a national spontaneous reporting system for monitoring AEs following vaccination [9,10]. VAERS accepts
reports from vaccine manufacturers, healthcare providers, vaccine
recipients and others. VAERS data includes information on demographics of the person vaccinated, vaccine type, and the AE. Signs
and symptoms of AEs are coded using the Medical Dictionary for
Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) terms [11]. A single report may be
assigned one or more MedDRA preferred terms (PTs). A report is
considered serious if the AE results in any of the following: death,
life-threatening illness, hospitalization or prolongation of existing
hospitalization, or permanent disability [12]. With the exception of
reports submitted by vaccine manufacturers, medical records are
routinely requested and reviewed for serious reports. We analyzed
US VAERS reports for LAIV4 received July1, 2013 through August 31,
2014, in those vaccinated from July 1, 2013 to June 30, 2014. We
compared the LAIV4 reports with LAIV3 reports from the previous
three inﬂuenza seasons – an inﬂuenza season is deﬁned as July 1 of
one year to June 30 of the following year. Foreign reports, reports
with unknown age, and reports for live or inactivated monovalent 2009 H1N1 (pandemic H1N1) inﬂuenza vaccines administered
concomitantly with LAIV3 were excluded.
VAERS is a routine surveillance program conducted as a public
health function and does not meet the deﬁnition of research; thus,
it is not subject to Institutional Review Board review and informed
consent requirements.
2.2. Descriptive analysis
We calculated descriptive statistics including mean and median
age of vaccinated individuals, the most common MedDRA PTs, and
the AE onset interval (from vaccination date [day 0] to onset of ﬁrst
symptoms). We analyzed reports by age groups 2–17 and 18–49
years old. We also conducted a limited analysis of LAIV4 reports in
children aged <2 years and adults aged >49 years, ages for which
the vaccine is not indicated.

were not mutually exclusive: (1) selected AEs of interest based on
previous studies (Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS), asthma/reactive
airway disease, anaphylaxis, and seizures), (2) clinically important
AEs that met the statistical threshold for a data mining ﬁnding
(i.e., EB05 >2), and (3) reports where LAIV4 appeared to have been
administered in error or “off label” to non-indicated groups (e.g.,
outside of the 2–49 year old age indication, pregnant women). As
part of routine VAERS procedures, medical records were requested
for all serious non-manufacturer reports. Physicians with expertise
in vaccine safety reviewed the reports. We ascertained the primary
event (the event that appeared to trigger the report to VAERS) and
assigned a primary diagnostic category using a method previously
described [15]. Cause of death was determined from information
documented in the autopsy report, death certiﬁcate, or medical
record. We did not assess the likelihood that the AE was caused
by the vaccine or whether a vaccination error contributed to an AE.
Reports of GBS and anaphylaxis were veriﬁed using the Brighton
Collaboration criteria or a physician’s diagnosis documented on the
medical records [16,17].

2.3. Disproportionality analysis
3. Results
We used Empirical Bayesian (EB) data mining [13] to identify
AEs reported more frequently than expected following LAIV4. We
used published criteria to identify LAIV4 vaccine-AE pairs reported
at least twice as frequently as would be expected (i.e., lower bound
of the 90% conﬁdence interval surrounding the EB geometric mean
[EB05] >2) [14]. LAIV4 reports were compared to all other vaccines in the VAERS database. We excluded from the analysis reports
of AEs described in the LAIV4 package insert since these were
observed in pre-licensure studies and expected to occur during
post-marketing safety surveillance.
2.4. Clinical review of reports
We performed a clinical review of all serious reports for LAIV4
and LAIV3 during the study period. In addition, we reviewed nonserious LAIV4 reports for the following three categories, which

During 2013–2014 inﬂuenza season, VAERS received a total of
928 US LAIV4 reports, with 779 of them in persons aged 2–49 years.
Of these reports, 599 (77%) were in children aged 2–17 years, which
included 31 non-death serious reports and one death report; 180
(23%) reports were in adults aged 18–49 years, which included nine
non-death serious reports and no death reports (Tables 1 and 2). In
addition, VAERS received 100 reports where LAIV4 was given to
individuals outside of the recommended ages (i.e., aged <2 or >49
years) and 49 reports where age was unknown. Approximately 12.7
million doses of LAIV4 were distributed for use in the United States
during the 2013–2014 inﬂuenza season (MedImmune, personal
communication, December, 2014). Report characteristics and the
most frequent MedDRA PTs for LAIV4 in the 2013–2014 inﬂuenza
season compared to LAIV3 in the previous three seasons are summarized in Tables 1 and 2. The percent of serious reports in children

compared to LAIV3, 5% vs. 6% and 5% vs. 8%, respectively.
3.1. Clinical review
Tables 3 and 4 summarize clinical reviews of non-death serious
LAIV4 reports by age group and body system categories, with LAIV3
reports from the previous three inﬂuenza seasons as a comparator.
3.1.1. Death reports
We identiﬁed one LAIV4 death report in a 14-year-old female
who died 44 days after vaccination from complications of cerebellar
vascular tumors.
3.1.2. Non-death serious reports
Among the 31 non-death serious reports in children aged 2–17
years, the most common AE diagnostic categories were neurologic 12(39%), 6 (9%) and 6 (9%) which included two GBS reports
described later, respiratory (6.19%), and other non-infectious
(6.19%) (Table 3). Among the nine non-death serious reports in
adults 18–49 years the most common AE diagnostic categories were
neurologic, respiratory, and cardiovascular with 2 (22%) reports for
each category (Table 4).
3.2. Pre-speciﬁed adverse events and conditions
3.2.1. Anaphylaxis
We identiﬁed an anaphylaxis report in a 21-year-old male who
received LAIV4, yellow fever, and hepatitis B vaccines and experienced cough, dyspnea, throat closure, and hives within 36 min
following vaccination. He was seen in the emergency room, treated
with epinephrine, and discharged home. We also identiﬁed an anaphylaxis report involving a 40-year-old nurse with a history of food
allergies to chocolate, peanuts, soy, and strawberries. She did not
actually receive LAIV4, symptom onset began approximately one
hour after administering the vaccine to others. Both case reports
met Brighton level 2 criteria for anaphylaxis.

P. Haber et al. / Vaccine 33 (2015) 1987–1992

3.2.2. Guillain-Barré syndrome
We identiﬁed two reports of GBS following LAIV4. One involved
a 3-year-old male with a history of croup during infancy, recurrent
otitis media, and hepatitis A vaccination one month prior to receipt
of LAIV4. The child received LAIV4 alone and developed neurologic
symptoms nine days following vaccination, which met Brighton
level 1 criteria for GBS. The second report involved a 3-year-old
female with a history of allergies to shellﬁsh who received LAIV4
alone and developed neurologic symptoms seven days following
vaccination, which met Brighton level 3 criteria for GBS. Neither
patient had a recent history of a respiratory or gastrointestinal
infection.
3.2.3. Febrile seizures
We identiﬁed one report of febrile seizure in a 5-year-old female
occurring 2 days after receipt of LAIV4 alone that required an emergency room visit. The patient had recovered by the time the VAERS
report was submitted.
3.2.4. History of asthma, reactive airway disease, or wheezing
We identiﬁed 35 LAIV4 reports involving patients with a history of asthma, wheezing, or reactive airway disease; 27 were in
children aged 2–17, which included seven in children aged 2–4
years and 20 in children aged 5–17 years, and eight in adults aged
18–49 years. Among the children, 23 reports were categorized as
non-serious and four as serious, which included asthma exacerbation (2), reactive airway disease (1), and acute viral gastroenteritis
(1). Among the 23 non-serious reports in children, four did not
describe an AE. The remaining 19 reports described respiratory conditions (9) – mostly wheezing episodes with other symptoms, other
non-infectious (4), non-anaphylaxis allergic reactions (5), and Bell’s
palsy (1).
Among the eight reports in adults, four were serious and
included one report each of non-anaphylaxis allergic reaction, asthma exacerbation, acute inﬂuenza A/upper respiratory
syndrome, and chills/cough/sore throat. The remaining four nonserious reports included one report each of asthma exacerbation,
nasal congestion/sinus pain, acute pericarditis, and optic neuritis.
3.2.5. Pregnancy
We identiﬁed 25 reports of pregnant women who received
LAIV4, of which 24 did not describe any AE. Median age of the
women was 28 years (range 15–36 years) and among 10 reports
with information on gestational age at time of vaccination, four
were vaccinated during the ﬁrst trimester, one during the second,
and ﬁve during the third trimester. The one report describing an
AE involved a serious report in a 3-day-old male diagnosed with
persistent pulmonary hypertension that required hospitalization
in the neonatal intensive care unit. The patient recovered and was
discharged home in good condition.
3.2.6. Disproportionality analysis
Empirical Bayesian data mining identiﬁed eight MedDRA PTs
with an EB05 >2. Three of these MedDRA PTs were symptoms that
were observed during pre-licensure clinical trials and are included
in the manufacturer’s package insert (rhinorrhea, cough, and respiratory tract congestion), and therefore were not further assessed.
The other ﬁve PTs included inﬂuenza (23) and several types of
vaccination errors: drug administration error (8), incorrect dose
administered (14), underdose (32), and expired drug administered
(253). Most (99%) of the vaccination error reports did not describe
an AE. The three error reports describing AEs included two reports
of nasal congestion with a drug administration error, and one report
of epistaxis with an underdose error.
Of the 23 reports describing inﬂuenza following LAIV4, ﬁve documented multiple cases on a single report form, resulting in a total

of 40 cases. Most (22 of 23) inﬂuenza reports were reported to
VAERS by the vaccine manufacturer. There was one serious report
in a 4 year-old male who received LAIV4 and 92 days later was hospitalized in an intensive care unit for pneumonia, severe respiratory
distress and wheezing. He was diagnosed with lower lobe pneumonia, inﬂuenza A infection, hypoxia, and dehydration. The patient
recovered and was discharged home in good condition. Among the
22 non-serious reports, 13 reports with a total of 26 cases included
children who tested positive for inﬂuenza A; median age was 5
years (range 3–10) and median onset was 82.5 days (range 2–114).
In two reports, children tested positive for inﬂuenza B; one child
was 5 years old and had onset 3 days after vaccination; the other
child was 6 years old and had onset less than 24 h after vaccination. In the remaining seven reports, which included 11 total cases,
inﬂuenza type was not speciﬁed. In these unspeciﬁed inﬂuenza
reports, median age was 6 years (range 3–9 years) and median onset
was 41 days (range 2–75 days). Upon farther evaluation we did not
detect unusual lot clustering or instances of expired vaccine.
3.2.7. Reports in children aged ≤2 years and adults aged ≥49
years
We identiﬁed 100 reports of LAIV4 given outside its age indication, 28 in children aged <2 years (median 1 year) and 72 in
adults aged >49 years (median 54 years). In 21 (75%) of the reports
in children <2 years, no AE was reported. AEs in the remaining
seven reports included respiratory (4), and other non-infectious
(3). Among the 72 reports in adults aged >49 years, 63 (87.5%) did
not report an AE. AEs in the remaining nine reports included allergic reactions (3) with one possible anaphylaxis case not veriﬁed,
other non-infectious (4), and respiratory (2).
4. Discussion
Our review of VAERS reports after LAIV4 in its initial season
of use (July 1, 2013–June 30, 2014) did not identify any new or
unexpected safety concerns. This represents the ﬁrst post-licensure
safety assessment of LAIV4 and adds to the existing body of
evidence on safety from the pre-licensure clinical trials [3,6–8].
Additionally, our review indicates that the safety proﬁle of LAIV4
is similar to LAIV3 based on previous VAERS reviews [18–20]. Just
over 94% of LAIV4 reports were non-serious and the most common adverse events were mild, self-limited conditions (e.g., fever,
headache and cough).
From clinical review of serious LAIV4 reports and reports of
selected AEs of interest, the most common non-death serious
reports were neurologic and respiratory. We identiﬁed only
two GBS reports, both in children and with symptom onset of 1
and 7 days following vaccination, within the 42-day window of
biological plausibility [21–23]. GBS is an acute, immune-mediated
demyelinating disorder of the peripheral nervous system that has
been inconsistently associated with inactivated inﬂuenza vaccines
[22,24–26]. Data mining did not detect increased proportional
reporting of GBS following LAIV4 compared with other vaccines.
The two reported cases of GBS should be interpreted in the
context of nearly 13 million doses of LAIV4 distributed by the
manufacturer. Anaphylaxis, another of our selected AEs of interest,
may be causally associated with vaccination in rare instances
[17,22]. Our review identiﬁed one report of anaphylaxis in a
vaccinated individual; however, concomitant administration of
other vaccines made it difﬁcult to assess the contribution of LAIV4
to the outcome. We identiﬁed reports of asthma and/or wheezing
in persons with a history of asthma and/or reactive airway disease
[27]. The manufacturer’s package insert for 2013–2014 contained a
statement in the Warning and Precautions section that “. . .persons
of any age with asthma may be at increased risk of wheezing

P. Haber et al. / Vaccine 33 (2015) 1987–1992

following the administration of FluMist” [2], and the 2013–2014
ACIP seasonal inﬂuenza vaccine recommendations listed asthma
as a contraindication for LAIV4 [3], although this recommendation
has been modiﬁed for 2014–15 inﬂuenza season to apply only to
asthma in children aged 2–4 years [4].
We identiﬁed disproportional reporting in data mining for the
MedDRA PT “inﬂuenza”. Clinical review of these reports, which had
a high number of test positive inﬂuenza A cases, suggests possible vaccine failure. Vaccine failure or breakthrough infection is
not a primary safety issue, but can be detected through VAERS
reporting, since VAERS accepts any report of an AE following vaccination. Data for the 2013–2014 inﬂuenza season indicate low
LAIV4 vaccine effectiveness against the inﬂuenza A H1N1pdm09
(pandemic) strain, the predominant strain during the season; the
reasons for the low observed vaccine effectiveness are under investigation [2, 28–30]. Although we cannot conclude that this data
mining signal is directly related to low LAIV4 vaccine effectiveness
against the inﬂuenza A H1N1pdm09 virus, this ﬁnding is consistent with the epidemiologic data for the 2013–2014 inﬂuenza
season [28–30]. No other disproportional reporting ﬁndings were
detected with the exception of certain vaccine administration
errors.
Administration of expired vaccine was the most common error
for LAIV4. This may be due to lack of awareness or confusion
over the shorter shelf-life for LAIV4 (18 weeks) compared to
inactivated inﬂuenza vaccines (through June 30 of each inﬂuenza
season regardless of manufacture date). Although administration
of expired LAIV4 might potentially result in lack of protection
against inﬂuenza disease, it is not known to be associated with AEs
[31,32].
LAIV4 is not recommended in pregnancy. However, exposure
to LAIV4 does occur, likely from inadvertent use in women who
are unaware they are pregnant at the time of vaccination and/or
whose healthcare provider is unaware the patient is pregnant [33].
We identiﬁed 25 reports of pregnant women who received LAIV4,
most of whom (96%) did not describe an AE.
VAERS is subject to limitations, including limitations of passive surveillance in general, such as underreporting, incomplete
information, varying quality of reports, and lack of an unvaccinated comparison group [9,10]. Because of these limitations it
is usually not possible to assess for causal associations between
vaccines and AEs from spontaneous reports to VAERS. However, as a national surveillance system, VAERS can rapidly
detect rare AEs and potential vaccine safety problems, which
can be further explored in carefully designed epidemiological
studies.
5. Conclusion
Our VAERS review of LAIV4 safety is reassuring and is consistent with data from the pre-licensure clinical trials and from
post-licensure safety assessments of LAIV3. We detected a substantial number of vaccination errors, such as expired vaccine being
administered and vaccination of pregnant women. Although most
errors did not involve an AE, the ﬁndings demonstrate the continued need for healthcare provider education and training on proper
indications. VAERS continues to monitor the safety of LAIV4, which
became increasingly important when ACIP preferentially recommended the use of LAIV4 in healthy children aged 2–8 years [4].
