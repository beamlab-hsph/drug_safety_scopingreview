SUMMARY
Purpose A population-based study and anecdotal reports have indicated that the publication of the Randomized Aldactone
Evaluation Study (RALES) was associated with not merely a broader use of spironolactone in the treatment of heart failure,
but also with a coinciding sharp increase in hyperkalemia-associated morbidity/mortality in patients also being treated with
ACE-inhibitors. Data mining algorithms (DMAs) are being applied to spontaneous reporting system (SRS) databases in
hopes of obtaining early warnings/additional insights into post-licensure safety data. We applied two DMAs (i.e. multi-item
gamma Poisson shrinker [MGPS] and proportional reporting ratios [PRRs]) to spontaneous reporting system (SRS) data to
determine if these DMAs could have provided an earlier indication of a possible hyperkalemia safety issue.
Methods MGPS and PRRs were retrospectively applied to US FDA-AERS, an SRS database. Year-by-year analysis and
analysis of increasing cumulative time intervals were performed on cases in which both spironolactone and hyperkalemia and
possibly related cardiac events had been reported.
Results Neither of the DMAs initially provided a compelling signal of disproportionate reporting (SDR) for hyperkalemia
after publication of RALES. However, using events consistent with clinical sequelae of hyperkalemia (e.g,. sudden death),
SDRs were identified with PRRs.
Conclusions The quality and usefulness of data mining analysis is highly situation dependent and may vary with the
knowledge and experience of the drug safety reviewer. Our analysis suggests that contemporary DMAs may have significant
limitations in detecting increased frequency of labeled events in real-life prospective pharmacovigilance. There is a paucity
of research in this area and we recommend further research for new approaches to detecting increased frequency of labeled
events. Copyright # 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

In the third quarter of 1999, the Randomized
Aldactone Evaluation Study (RALES) concluded that
spironolactone, in addition to standard therapy,
substantially reduced the risk of both morbidity and

776

mortality among patients with severe heart failure.
Angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are
also indicated in these patients. However, when ACEinhibitors are used together with spironolactone, lifethreatening hyperkalemia can occur.1 Thus, a population-based time series analysis published after the
publication of RALES, reported that the positive
results of RALES were not merely associated with a
rapid increase in the number of prescriptions of
spironolactone for older patients with heart failure
already under treatment with an ACE inhibitor, but an
ecological secular analysis suggested that this
increased prescribing coincided with an increase in
the number of hospital admissions, morbidity, and
mortality related to hyperkalemia as well.2
Various computational signal detection algorithms,
also known as data mining algorithms (DMAs), are
being applied to spontaneous reporting system (SRS)
databases to screen for statistical dependencies between
drugs and reported adverse events in hopes of obtaining
early warnings of safety problems as well as gaining
additional insights into post-licensure safety data. If
observed statistical dependencies (i.e., high ‘scores’)
reliably help predict causal relationships, DMAs could
significantly improve our ability to detect early ‘signals’
from adverse drug events (ADEs).
There are basically two categories of contemporary
DMAs in use in pharmacovigilance for detecting
adverse events in SRS databases: ‘simple,’ nonBayesian (or frequentist) disproportionality analyses
such as proportional reporting ratios (PRRs)3,4 and
reporting odds ratios (RORs)4,5, and a second
methodology that uses additional statistical adjustments and Bayesian modeling, such as the multi-item
gamma Poisson shrinker (MGPS)6 and the Bayesian
confidence propagation neural network (BCPNN).7
Both approaches provide metrics related to the
background probability of drug (across all events)
and event (across all/most drugs) to derive the internal
control or model of expected reporting frequency in
the absence of external data on level of drug exposure,
a ‘pseudo observed to expected ratio’ or RR. Hence
these data mining methodologies are also called
disproportionality analyses (DA).
Due to the semantic ambiguity around terms such as
‘signals’ or ‘alerts,’ we hereafter refer to calculations
of DA exceeding certain pre-selected thresholds, as
‘signals of disproportionate reporting’ (SDR)8 This
emphasizes that DMAs merely highlight reporting
relationships that may not necessarily reflect causality,
but which may—depending upon the clinical context
in which they occur—generate hypotheses for further
investigation.

Both the databases and the algorithms have
significant limitations. Thus, SRS databases collect
data in an uncontrolled fashion and have many
inherent biases and data distortions at the level of the
individual cases and in the overall sampling mechanism. From a public health and a regulatory point of
view, the majority of reports in SRS databases
represent ‘noise,’ because the reports are associated
with treatment indications (i.e., confounding by
indication), co-morbid illnesses, protopathic bias,
channeling bias, and/or reporting artifacts or the
reported adverse events are already labeled or are
medically trivial.
Moreover, Bayesian DMAs may be associated with
some decreased capacity for early detection of SDRs
compared to frequentist disproportionality analyses,
when commonly cited thresholds of disproportionality
are used.9–12 This is not surprising because Bayesian
methodologies use a mathematical process to achieve
a statistical ‘shrinkage’ of SDRs associated with low
observed or expected frequency in hopes of improving
the ‘signal/noise’ ratio by down-weighting (shrinking)
scores based on small numbers of observed and/or
expected reports that are associated with higher
statistical variability. Expressed a little differently,
Bayesian approaches encapsulate a prior belief that
the observed to expected ratios of most drug-event
combinations (DECs) are closer to each other and
closer to one than the crude data indicate due to
sampling variability. In effect, the Bayesian algorithms have more initial ‘skepticism’ built in than the
frequentist methods. The degree of skepticism
depends on the prior probabilities that are chosen.
For reducing the number of spurious associations
presented to the user, Bayesian methods provide a
clear advantage. However, since the Bayesian models
do not have clinical criterion incorporated, clinically
relevant DECs might also be ‘shrunk’ along with
noise. It should be noted that many discussions about
statistical calculations on SRS data are based on
asymptotic arguments and assumption of a repeatable
sampling mechanism to determine an underlying
population parameter, assumptions that may not make
any sense in the context of SRS.13 As George Box said
‘all models are wrong, some are useful.’14
Because of the unique variety of events, that are of
legitimate interest in pharmacovigilance, detecting
and studying drug safety issues for marketed drugs
requires a multidisciplinary approach, using various
methodologies and datasets (including spontaneous
ADE reports and post-marketing clinical/(pharmacoepidemiological data).15 Therefore, the exact place
and potential uses of DMAs applied to a non-random

reports of hyperkalemia after publication of rales
convenience sample of SRS data is currently the
subject of considerable discussion.
The rationale of the current study was to analyze
whether DMAs applied to the FDA-AERS database
might have also directed the attention of safety
reviewers in a real-life pharmacovigilance setting to
an increase in hyperkalemia after the publication of
RALES similar to the rise described in the 2004 study.
Therefore, we retrospectively applied the empirical
Bayesian DMA, MGPS, and the frequentist DMA,
PRRs, to the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Adverse Event Reporting System
(AERS) database to evaluate whether these tools
would have provided an early indication of spironolactone-ACE inhibitor-associated hyperkalemia as
reported in the aforementioned population-based
study.

METHODS
Adverse event data set
The adverse event data set for this analysis consisted
of an extract of the FDA AERS database with
duplicate reports and drug redundancies removed or
reduced by the vendor according to a proprietary
cleaning algorithm.16 AERS is a computerized
information database for post-approval safety surveillance. It functions as an early warning system for
adverse drug reactions not detected during preapproval testing. It contains, mainly AE reports of
approved drugs and therapeutic biological products
submitted by pharmaceutical companies in accordance with mandatory reporting obligations as well as
reports submitted voluntarily by health care professionals and consumers. Reports are reviewed and
coded for data entry in accordance with the
standardized terminology of the Medical Dictionary
for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). FDA-AERS
was introduced in October 1997 to allow the FDA to
receive reports from pharmaceutical companies by
electronic submission. Historical data from its
predecessor, i.e., SRS, were migrated into AERS at
that time.
The data extract used for the current analysis
included data in AERS from 1968 through the third
quarter of 2003.16 Only anonymized encoded data are
provided by the FDA to the vendor. Quantitative drug
utilization information for spironolactone was
obtained from IMS Health. To convert the number
of prescriptions generated from IMS Health, to the
estimated person-time of exposure experience, we

assumed that the average daily dose of spironolactone
is 75 mg (http://www.whocc.no/atcddd/).
Selected drug-event combinations
Our analysis included 2-dimensional (2-D) analyses
(i.e., drug-event, instead of drug-drug-event, as in 3-D
analysis). Seven relevant MedDRA Preferred Terms
(i.e., event terms indicative of hyperkalemia: hyperkalaemia, blood potassium increased or event terms
indicative of fatal or life-threatening sequelae of
hyperkalemia: cardiac arrest, sudden death, sudden
cardiac death, ventricular tachycardia, ventricular
fibrillation) were selected. AERS reports listing
spironolactone as suspect drug and listing one or
more of these events were analyzed. All adverse
events in AERS for spironolactone, suspect drug only,
exceeding the pre-specified thresholds were examined
to prevent exclusion of important data.
Data mining process
The two data mining algorithms chosen for this
analysis were unstratified ‘standard’ PRRs12 and the
stratified MGPS.6 Data mining was performed
individually on the selected MedDRA Preferred
Terms.
Data mining algorithms
All variants of disproportionality analysis including
PRRs and MGPS focus on low-dimensional projections of very high dimensional data, typically 2dimensional contingency tables.
Proportional reporting ratio (PRRs). The PRR is a
simple metric relating the proportional representation
of an event of interest with a drug of interest compared
to the proportional representation of that event among
all other drugs in the database (Table 1). For this
analysis the commonly cited threshold, PRR > 2 with
an associated x2 > 4 (with Yates correction) and N > 2
was considered an SDR.3 The algorithm was applied

to the data for each year individually (year-by-year) in
the AERS database as well as to the data cumulatively
subsetted by year (i.e., the analysis by year included
that year as well as previous years) to include the
largest sample size in the latter instance.
Multi-item gamma poisson shrinker (MGPS). The
theoretical basis of MGPS has been described in detail
elsewhere.6,13,17
Briefly, all Bayesian statistical analyses begin with
a prior distribution for the parameters to be estimated.
In the case of MGPS, the ‘true’ RRs are the
‘unknowns.’ A standard Bayesian analysis specifies
the prior distribution before looking at the data. Via
Bayes’ theorem, the data then transform the prior
distribution into a posterior distribution. This posterior
distribution in a precise sense combines prior knowledge (that the prior distribution encapsulates) with the
evidence from the data. MGPS based on an empirical
Bayesian approach places a prior distribution on RRs
(see Table 1). The prior distribution encapsulates a
prior belief that most RRs are close to a value of one.
Only in the face of substantial evidence from the data
does MGPS return an RR estimate that is substantially
larger than one. For the specific Bayesian setup that
MGPS uses, observed counts in excess of 10 result in
RR estimates that typically receive essentially no
shrinkage although in practice larger differentials have
been observed depending on the thresholds
used.10,12,17 Also, in contrast to standard Bayesian
algorithms, empirical Bayesian algorithms, like
MGPS, use the observed data to construct the prior
distribution—in effect it double dips into the data.
Regardless of how the Bayesian analysis handles
the prior, the approach produces a posterior distribution for each RR. The EBGM is the mean of the
posterior distribution. Other summaries are possible.
For example, DuMouchel mentions ‘EB05’.17 This is
the 5th percentile of the posterior distribution—
meaning that there is a 95% probability that the ‘true’
RR exceeds the EB05. Since EB05 is always smaller
than EBGM this, in a sense, adds extra shrinkage and
represents a more restrictive choice than EBGM. A
number of studies have provided examples where
EB05 might be too conservative in the sense that it
could result in delayed detection of relevant signals
that other disproportionality methods detected earlier.10–12 The comparative utilities and penalties
associated with each method are unclear. For this
analysis, the commonly cited threshold, EB05 > 2 with
an N > 0 was considered an SDR.6 As with PRRs, the
algorithm was applied to the data for each year

individually as well as to the data cumulatively
subsetted by year.
Data mining parameters
A variety of data mining options and parameters are
provided by the vendor for MGPS including basic
covariate adjustment (stratification by age, sex, and
year of report). It is claimed that stratification tends to
reduce spurious associations due to confounding (e.g.,
Simpson’s paradox) and markedly decreases the
volume of disproportionalities.6,17 However, it would
be premature to assume that basic covariate stratification has been proven as the procedure of choice. Given
the nature of the data, particularly the enormous
amount of potential measured and unmeasured
confounders and/or biological effect modifiers, basic
covariate stratification could have different effects in
different instances. For the present analysis, the data
mining for EB05 calculations was performed on
suspect drug-ADE pairs, using stratification by age,
sex, and FDA year of report for cumulative subsetting
by year. MGPS was also applied to the data for each
year individually with similar stratification. The
software that we used for the current analyses did
not allow us to conduct stratified analysis for PRR, and
hence, all presented PRRs in this article are standard
unstratified PRRs, in contrast to MGPS. All analyses
were conducted with WebVDME (LincolnTechnologies, Waltham, MA).
Comparative analysis
Metrics for the comparative analysis included the
number of DECs that generated SDRs with PRRs,
MGPS, both or neither method, and the differential
timing of SDRs between the two methods.
Other analyses
Changes in crude reporting rates and a cumulative and
year-by-year analysis in which reporting rates were
obtained by dividing the number of spironolactonehyperkalemia cases by the estimated patient-time of
exposure experience from IMS-health data were also
calculated.
All the analyses were descriptive, and no inferential
statistics looking for trends in the data were applied.
RESULTS
There were no cases reported in FDA-AERS with the
MedDRA Preferred Term, sudden cardiac death. As

The current retrospective disproportionality analysis
on SRS data did not strongly highlight the possibility
of a coinciding increased frequency of spironolactoneassociated hyperkalemia reports post RALES. This is
in contrast to Juurlink and coworkers’ population
based time series analysis.2 It could be that the
findings reported by Juurlink et al. are spurious since
interpretation of aggregated data might be illusive, and
can be subject to severe pitfalls. However, a relative

DISCUSSION

MedDRA Preferred Term

of the third quarter of 2003 there were 449 cases of
hyperkalaemia, and 26 cases of blood potassium
increased (Table 2). Blood potassium increased, an
equivalent MedDRA Preferred term to hyperkalaemia, first appeared in FDA-AERS for any drug in
1997, and for spironolactone in 1999. The MedDRA
Preferred Term Blood potassium increased was used
far less often than hyperkalaemia in the entire FDAAERS database (6310 vs. 1228 reports).
Hyperkalaemia was the only event highlighted with
an SDR by both metrics over all time periods after
1999, in both the cumulative analysis and the year-byyear analysis (Tables 2 and 3, Figure 1a and b). Visual
inspection revealed no change point obviating the
need for statistical testing. These post-1999 SDRs
represented the continuation of persistent SDRs that
began in 1970 the year of the very first report.
Crude reporting frequencies for hyperkalemia postRALES generally increased. The largest increase in
crude reporting frequency (34%) was noted in 2000,
the year after publication of RALES and ranged from
16 to 24% in the ensuing three years of the current
analysis. In the 13 years prior to 1999, the average
increase in crude reporting frequency was 19%.
A cumulative by year and year-by-year analysis in
which reporting rates were calculated by dividing the
number of spironolactone-hyperkalemia cases by the
estimated patient-time of exposure experience from
IMS-health data, also demonstrated a coinciding trend
after 1999 (showing a two-fold increase going from
1999 to 2000).
For the remaining four selected events, there were
no SDRs with the more specific metric, MGPS, pre-,
or post-RALES. On the other hand, with the more
sensitive PRR metric, the cumulative analysis highlighted SDRs post-RALES for the MedDRA Preferred
Terms sudden death and ventricular fibrillation, both
for the first time in 2002 (Table 2). For the year-byyear analysis, SDRs were highlighted with PRR for
these latter two events as well in 2002, but not for the
remaining years of the current analysis (Table 3).

under-reporting of reports of hyperkalemia following
RALES or the large and persistent disproportionate
reporting of hyperkalemia with spironolactone over
the entire observational period, especially the period
pre-RALES after 1989, could have masked any postRALES changes. We believe the latter hypothesis to
be much more credible. In circumstances in which a
well-described ADE persistently accounts for a
significant number of reports with a drug, basic
disproportionality analyses may not be sensitive
enough to discern interval changes in reporting rates,
and hence more in depth analyses and/or alternative
methods may be necessary. For example, in a post
hoc—less obvious—analysis with MGPS using ACE
inhibitors rather than spironolactone as suspect drugs
(i.e., 17 ACE inhibitors in the FDA-AERS database,
13 of which had reports of hyperkalaemia), an
increase of the SDR for ramipril first occurring in
2001, was demonstrated. It should be stressed here,
that since RALES and the 2004 population-based time
series analysis did not provide any data on individual
ACE inhibitors, no inferences can be made with regard
to this finding with ramipril. Furthermore, post hoc
analyses and the interpretation of their subsequent
results may reflect confirmation bias and may not
reflect real-world performance in prospective pharmacovigilance; in other words, the performance of
DMAs may be highly situation dependent. Monitoring
crude reporting rates for hyperkalemia alone would
involve a more empirical assessment of significance.
In addition, year-by-year analysis in which reporting
rates were calculated by dividing the number of
spironolactone-hyperkalemia cases by the estimated
patient-time of exposure experience from IMS-health
data revealed a coinciding trend with the publication
of RALES, albeit that we only had IMS Health data
available for 5 years before RALES was published.
Therefore, it is not exactly known what the trend was
before 1994.
Even though the current data mining analysis did
not strongly highlight a coinciding increased frequency of spironolactone-associated hyperkalemia
reports post-RALES, it is possible that a safety
reviewer, in the course of routine pharmacovigilance
post-RALES, using a frequentist algorithm (in this
instance PRRs) and finding subsequently SDRs for
sudden death, ventricular fibrillation, ventricular
tachycardia, and cardiac arrest, the clinical sequelae
of hyperkalemia, along with information from the
published literature18–20 that already indicated broader
use of spironolactone in treatment of heart failure
subsequent to publication of RALES, might have been
able to identify the overall safety issue earlier than,

and independent of Juurlink and colleagues’ analysis.2
This underscores the importance of not using these
tools in a ‘biological vacuum’, which represents a
limitation of many previously published data mining
exercises. However, the utility of these approaches in a
given scenario would also be a function of the
opportunity costs associated with false positive
findings.
There are significant limitations to our analysis.
Real-life pharmacovigilance settings involve the use
of DMAs as potential supplements to and not
substitutes for traditional signal detection practices
based on the clinical and pharmacoepidemiological
domain expertise of the ‘prepared mind.’21 The
complex, subtle, and subjective cognitive processes
of the ‘prepared mind‘ operating alone or in
conjunction with a DMA, defy explicit characterization but are necessary for the holistic/multidisciplinary approach to drug safety and the optimal use of
these data mining techniques. There is a large space of

available choices in data mining (as described in ‘Data
Mining Parameters’)22 and the results may vary
accordingly, and therefore the optimum deployment of
DMAs with SRS data remains to be determined.
Herein, we have studied a very limited number of
possible implementations of each algorithm and
therefore our analyses should not be interpreted as a
definitive comparison of these tools. For instance, for
our retrospective analysis one could argue that for the
evaluation of the potentially fatal events with MGPS
where no SDRs were identified, a safety reviewer
could have used lower thresholds or even eliminated
thresholds in evaluation of these events in keeping
with traditional pharmacovigilance practice. Different
results may also have been obtained if the MedDRA
Preferred Terms were combined using Boolean logic.
This may particularly be a factor given the hypergranularity of the MedDRA dictionary.
The plethora of modifiable parameters introduces
the potential for confirmation bias because they create

the opportunity for a data miner to retrofit an analysis
based on the fit of the results to their pre-existing
expectations (a new form of multiple comparisons).
There is, however, also a logistical aspect to this issue
that does not receive attention, namely, which data
mining configurations should constitute a ‘standard
panel’ of data mining runs for general pharmacovigilance purposes. To name just a few possibilities,
each time a data mining analysis is scheduled the
safety reviewer could routinely perform both 2-D and
3-D runs, suspect versus suspect plus concomitant
medications, MedDRA Preferred Terms as well as
SMQs and ad hoc case definitions, internal, and public
data bases etc. The number of combinations of data
mining analyses can, therefore, grow exponentially.
While these emerging technologies allow users to
rapidly complete computationally intensive calculations, we are concerned that this aspect may be
slightly exaggerated. We are concerned that numerous
presentations and publications provide the impression
to people that are contemplating the use of these tools,
that the push of a button within a given data mining run
is all that is required to instantly obtain the
aforementioned combinations of data mining analysis.
In fact, each variation requires a new data mining run
and each data mining run does have resource
requirements in terms of time, manpower, and
memory space. We want potential users to have an
accurate understanding of the capabilities of these
impressive tools.
Additionally, the clinical events we pre-selected
were those we considered to be consistent with lifethreatening sequelae of hyperkalemia. In our review of
all adverse events in FDA-AERS for spironolactone
exceeding the pre-specified thresholds, the adverse
event atrioventricular block complete, (an effect of
hyperkalemia rarely documented in the literature) was
identified as an event exceeding the commonly cited
thresholds for both MGPS and PRRs after publication
of RALES. Hence one could argue that this event
should also have been pre-selected. It should also be
noted that a 3-D (drug–drug-event) approach might
have produced different results and might be a
superior approach for drug–drug interactions, such
as that between spironolactone and ACE-inhibitors.
We did not perform a 3-D analysis for a few reasons.
For this simple drug interaction we wanted to use a
simple and practical implementation of DMA that
would most closely mirror the real world pharmacovigilance scenario of a safety reviewer desiring a
simple and practical method of helping to screen the
SRS database. The version of software available to us
at the time of the analysis did not provide a graphical

interface for readily viewing time trends of 3-D
analysis within a single data mining run. In addition,
our anecdotal experience indicates that 3-D disproportionality analysis may highlight an overabundance
of associations.
Notwithstanding the specific limitations to our
analysis and more general limitations and biases
inherent to SRS data in general and consequently to
data mining in pharmacovigilance that have been
discussed elsewhere13, we believe—as illustrated by
our analysis—that there is a potential role of DMAs to
efficiently identify/refine an index of suspicion of
more subtle safety issues in addition to examining
relationships between a drug of interest and an event in
the reporting database. However, it also points out

KEY POINTS
 Two well-described DMAs—as commonly
implemented—failed to provide a signal of
increased hyperkalemia coincident with spironolactone use after publication of RALES
upon initial analysis. This was possibly due to
large and persistent disproportionate reporting
of hyperkalemia with spironolactone preRALES, masking any post-RALES changes.
 A supplemental analysis, using events consistent with clinical sequelae of hyperkalemia did
identify SDRs with one of the DMAs.
 If these techniques had been used at the time the
SDRs were generated, they might have directed
the attention of the drug safety expert to this
issue. However, this is highly contingent on the
knowledge and experience of the safety
reviewer and the methods, metrics, and
thresholds selected.
 Real-life pharmacovigilance settings involve
the use of DMAs as potential supplements to
and not substitutes for the multiple methods and
data streams and traditional signal detection
practices based on the clinical and epidemiological domain expertise of the ‘prepared
mind.’
 The principle concern of pharmacovigilance is
the detection of adverse events that are novel in
terms of their clinical nature, severity, and/or
frequency. There is a paucity of published
research on emerging change-point methodologies for detecting an increased frequency of
labeled events.

potential limitations of contemporary data mining
algorithms as commonly deployed for screening
increased frequency phenomena. The more routine
use of data mining in prospective pharmacovigilance
and the extension of collaborations between the
pharmacoepidemiologist and the drug safety reviewer
with the intent to do further research in this area, may
improve the performance of these potentially valuable
tools.
