The aim of this study has been to investigate the time-to-onset and onset-pattern of drug-induced interstitial lung
disease (DILD) after the administration of monoclonal antibodies through the use of the spontaneous adverse reaction
reporting system of the Japanese Adverse Drug Event Report database. DILD datasets for adalimumab, bevacizumab,
cetuximab, denosumab, golimumab, in‰iximab, nivolumab, panitumumab, pembrolizumab, tocilizumab, and
trastuzumab were used to calculate the median time-to-onset of DILD, as well as the Weibull distribution parameters.
The median time-to-onset of DILD for pembrolizumab and in‰iximab was within 1 month. The median time-to-onset of
DILD for cetuximab, nivolumab, panitumumab, bevacizumab, golimumab, trastuzumab, and tocilizumab ranged from
1 to 2 months. The median time-to-onset of DILD for denosumab and adalimumab was more than 2 months. In‰iximab, trastuzumab and tocilizumab, and denosumab were estimated to ˆt the early failure type proˆle of the Weibull distribution parameters. Cetuximab, nivolumab, panitumumab, bevacizumab, golimumab, and adalimumab were estimated to ˆt the random failure type proˆle. Pembrolizumab was estimated to ˆt the wear out failure type proˆle. Cluster
analysis was performed to classify the time-to-onset patterns of DILD. Hierarchical cluster analysis showed 3 clusters.
The ˆndings of this study established both the most likely time period and onset-pattern of DILD that can occur in
patients after the administration of monoclonal antibody agents.

INTRODUCTION
The Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency
(PMDA) has created and released a spontaneous adverse reaction reporting system for the Japanese Adverse Drug Event Report (JADER) database. The
JADER is a unitized large-scale database that re‰ects
the realities of clinical practice. This database has
been recognized as one of the primary tools for pharmacovigilance assessments, and it used to conduct
risk analysis of adverse reactions.16) Several studies
have previously indicated the time-to-onset of adverse
reactions using JADER and/or U.S. Food and Drug
Administration Adverse Event Reporting System.79)
The overall aim of this study has been to investigate
the time-to-onset and the onset-pattern of drug-induced interstitial lung disease (DILD) following the
administration of monoclonal antibody agents using
the JADER database.
DILD is one of the most serious adverse reactions
associated with the use of molecularly-targeted drugs.
Currently, there are more than 450 diŠerent drugs
that have been implicated in DILD.10) Suggested

DILD mechanisms include, 1) the induction of pulmonary ˆbrosis caused by a direct toxic reaction to
the drugs, 2) drugs acting as potential antigens or
haptens, and causing immune-mediated lung toxicity,
and 3) drugs causing phospholipidosis in alveolar
macrophages and in type 2 cells. Since DILD is considered to be a clinically serious and potentially lifethreatening toxicity, the immediate administration of
an appropriate treatment is required in these patients.
In addition, the clinical features of these early onset
cases are characterized by a rapid progression and
high mortality rate after the administration of
geˆtinib.11) Furthermore, an increase has especially
been noted in the amounts of data for DILD in tandem with several new biologic agents, such as epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors
(EGFR TKI), anti-EGFR antibody, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors, immune checkpoint inhibitors, Bcr-Abl TKI, and multi-kinase
inhibitors.1225) Several studies have also reported that
the incidence of DILD is higher in Japan versus other
countries, with this trend more prominently observed
in the post-marketing surveillance studies of EGFR
TKIs and the anti-EGFR antibody.1114,20,25)
Several studies have shown that the post-marketing

spontaneous reporting database can be a valuable
resource for estimating the time-to-onset of adverse
reactions for the Weibull analysis.2634) Furthermore,
we postulated that cluster analysis could be applied to
classifying the time-to-onset patterns of DILD.35,36)
Our previous study demonstrated that the median
time-to-onset of DILD for small molecule
molecularly-targeted drugs such as dasatinib, erlotinib, everolimus, geˆtinib, lapatinib, osimertinib,
and temsirolimus ranged from 1 to 2 months.37) In
addition, the median time-to-onset of the DILD for
alectinib, imatinib, and tofacitinib ranged from 2 to 3
months, while the median time-to-onset of the DILD
for sunitinib and sorafenib ranged from 8 to 9
months. The Weibull distributions for bortezomib,
crizotinib, erlotinib, afatinib, geˆtinib, dasatinib,
nilotinib, lapatinib, imatinib, and sorafenib were estimated to ˆt the early failure type proˆle, while those
for osimertinib and everolimus were estimated to ˆt
the wear out failure type proˆle. The Weibull distributions for temsirolimus, alectinib, tofacitinib, and
sunitinib were estimated to ˆt the random failure type
proˆle. Cluster analysis for small molecule
molecularly-targeted drugs showed that there were 4
clusters. It appears that the diŠerences observed between the clusters may be indicative of the mechanism
of action for some of these small molecule
molecularly-targeted drugs. Thus, it is important to
determine how the DILD occurrence varies over time
during the administration of molecularly-targeted
drug therapy.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
After accessing the PMDA website, the JADER
database was downloaded for the period from April
2004 to October 2017.38) This database, which consists of 4 data tables, includes a patient demographics
information table, drug information table, adverse
events table (REAC), and primary illness table. The
adverse events in REAC are coded according to the
terminology preferred by the Medical Dictionary for
Regulatory Activities/Japanese version (MedDRA/J
ver. 20.1).39) To extract the DILD from REAC, the
interstitial lung disease (Preferred Term: Standardized MedDRA Queries; 20000042) was used. The
lowest level term group for the interstitial lung disease
in MedDRA includes many diŠerent syndromes (e.g.,
acute diŠuse inˆltrative lung disease, chronic interstitial pneumonia, follicular bronchiolitis, interstitial

Vol. 138, No. 12 (2018)

lung ˆbrosis, interstitial pneumonia, pneumonia interstitial diŠuse, interstitial pneumonia aggravated,
etc.). Both the drug information (2998521 cases),
along with the adverse event and outcome information (749188 cases), were integrated into our time-toonset database using JMP 13.2 (SAS Institute Inc.,
Cary). However, duplicate cases are known to exist in
these tables, thus, these reports can have an impact on
evaluation and analysis. In order to exclude any overlap from these previously reported cases, all duplicate
reported cases based on the associated identiˆcation
number were removed. In addition, any forms in
which there were blanks or where the data were not
correctly described were excluded. All data within the
mean of ±3S.D. were used for the data analysis.
Time-to-onset of DILD was calculated from the time
of the patient's prescription to the ˆrst occurrence of
DILD. After data cleaning, any datasets for the timeto-onset of DILD for adalimumab, bevacizumab,
cetuximab, denosumab, golimumab, in‰iximab,
nivolumab, panitumumab, pembrolizumab, tocilizumab, and trastuzumab that had more than 50 cases
were then used to calculate the Weibull parameters.
The reporting odds ratio (ROR) was used for quantitative signal detection.3,4,6,8,2830) The RORs [95％
conˆdence interval ( 95 ％ CI )] of DILD for
adalimumab, bevacizumab, cetuximab, denosumab,
golimumab, in‰iximab, nivolumab, panitumumab,
pembrolizumab, tocilizumab, and trastuzumab were

The scale parameter of the Weibull distribution is
used to determine the scale of the data distribution
function, with the scale parameter deˆned as 63.2％
of the lower side of the Weibull distribution.2634)
Thus, when a larger value for the scale parameter is
present, this stretches the distribution, while the
presence of a smaller value for the scale parameter
will shrink the data distribution. The shape parameter
of the Weibull distribution can be used to deˆne a
hazard without having to refer to a reference population. For example, if the shape parameter is less than
1 and the 95％ CI of the shape parameter is also less
than the value 1, the hazard is considered to have
rapidly decreased over time (an early failure type pro-

RESULTS
The median time-to-onsets of DILD for pembrolizumab, in‰iximab, cetuximab, nivolumab, panitumumab, bevacizumab, golimumab, trastuzumab,
tocilizumab, denosumab, and adalimumab were 20,
31, 42, 47, 49, 50, 55, 55.5, 57, 64.5, and 126 d,
respectively (Table 1). The median time-to-onset of
DILD for adalimumab was 6 times longer than that
for pembrolizumab. The median time-to-onset of
DILD for pembrolizumab was signiˆcantly shorter
than that found for the other drugs. Similarly, the
median time-to-onset of DILD for in‰iximab was signiˆcantly shorter than that found for all of the other
drugs, with the exception of cetuximab. The median
time-to-onset of DILD for denosumab was signiˆcantly longer than that observed for cetuximab
and nivolumab. In addition, the median time-to-onset of DILD for adalimumab was signiˆcantly longer
than that observed for all other agents, with the exception of denosumab.
The histograms of the time-to-onset of DILD for
in‰iximab, trastuzumab, denosumab and tocilizumab, showed rapid decreases with time (F, G, I,
and J in Fig. 1). Since the upper 95％ CI for the
shape parameter was less than 1, the DILD onset time
proˆles of these drugs were estimated to be similar to
the early failure type proˆles of the Weibull distribu-

Analysis

tion (Table 2). The DILD onset time proˆles for
cetuximab, nivolumab, panitumumab, bevacizumab,
golimumab, and adalimumab were estimated to ˆt the
random failure type proˆle based on the 95％ CI of
the shape parameter including the value 1 (B, C, D,
E, H, and K in Fig. 1). The time-to-onset of DILD
cases for pembrolizumab demonstrated that there was
broad distribution along with a maximum value at a
speciˆc time (A in Fig. 1). Both the estimated shape
parameters and the 95％ CI of the shape parameter
for pembrolizumab exceeded 1. Therefore, the onsetpattern of DILD for pembrolizumab was estimated to
be the wear out failure type proˆle.
Figure 2 shows the hierarchical cluster analysis that
generated the dendrogram for estimation of the 3
clusters. Cluster 1, which included pembrolizumab,
in‰iximab, cetuximab, nivolumab, panitumumab,
and bevacizumab, exhibited a median time-to-onset
of DILD that ranged from 20 to 50 d. With regard to
the proˆles, in‰iximab showed an early failure type
proˆle, while cetuximab, nivolumab, panitumumab,
and bevacizumab showed random failure type proˆles, and pembrolizumab showed a wear out failure
type proˆle. Cluster 2, which included golimumab,
trastuzumab, tocilizumab, and denosumab, showed a
median time-to-onset of DILD that ranged from 55 to
64.5 d. With regard to the proˆles, trastuzumab,
tocilizumab and denosumab exhibited early failure
type proˆles, while golimumab exhibited a random
failure type proˆle. Cluster 3 included only
adalimumab, which exhibited a random failure type
proˆle with 126 d as its median time-to-onset of
DILD.
DISCUSSION
Many reports of post-marketing surveillance stud-

Vol. 138, No. 12 (2018)

YAKUGAKU ZASSHI

ies (special drug use-results survey and long-term use
studies) for monoclonal antibody agents indicated
the incidence, grade, and/or time-to-onset of
DILD.11,12,14,20,25) The ˆndings of this study established both the most likely time period and onset-pattern of DILD that can occur in patients after the administration of speciˆc monoclonal antibody agents.
The median time-to-onset and onset-pattern of the
DILD after administration of monoclonal antibody
agents in this study, and small molecule molecularlytargeted drugs in our previous study with the same
mechanism of action, were compared.37) The median
time-to-onset of DILD for the monoclonal antibodies
of EGFR, cetuximab (42 d) and panitumumab (49
d), showed that these occurred later than those observed for the small molecule molecularly-targeted
drugs of the EGFR TKIs, erlotinib (21 d), geˆtinib
(24 d), and osimertinib (34.5 d). In addition, the
DILD onset time proˆles for cetuximab and
panitumumab were estimated to be the random
failure type. However, the proˆles for erlotinib and
geˆtinib were estimated to be the early failure type,
while osimertinib was estimated to be the wear out
failure type proˆle. The median time-to-onset of
DILD for the monoclonal antibody of HER2,
trastuzumab, was 55.5 d, while those for the small
molecule molecularly-targeted drugs of the HER2
receptor inhibitors, afatinib and lapatinib, were 26.5
and 53 d, respectively. The DILD onset time proˆles
for trastuzumab, afatinib, and lapatinib were estimated to ˆt the early failure type proˆle. The median
time-to-onset values of DILD for both monoclonal
antibody and small molecule molecularly-targeted
drug for HER2 were almost the same. Furthermore,
the onset-pattern of DILD for the agents used to target HER2 represented the early failure type proˆle.
Bevacizumab, which is the monoclonal antibody of
vascular endothelial growth factor receptors
(VEGFR), inhibited the wound healing process during recovery from a lung injury.40) The median timeto-onset of bevacizumab-induced DILD was 50 d
with a random failure type proˆle, while the median
time-to-onset of DILD for the small molecule
molecularly-targeted agents, sunitinib and sorafenib,
which inhibit multiple receptor tyrosine kinases including VEGFR inhibitors, were 247 d with a random
failure type proˆle and 262 d with an early failure
type proˆle, respectively. The present study showed
that there was also a wide range for the time-to-onset

1591

of DILD for the monoclonal antibody agents for
tumor necrosis factor a (TNFa)-targeted therapy.
The median time-to-onsets of DILD for in‰iximab
and golimumab, were 31 and 55 d, respectively, while
it was 126 d for adalimumab. Several studies have
reported that the time-to-onset of DILD for
monoclonal antibody agents for the immune checkpoint that blocks the interaction between
programmed death 1 (PD-1) and its ligands (PD-L1
and PD-L2), nivolumab and pembrolizumab, ranged
from 3 to 8 weeks.18,2224) The median time-to-onset
of DILD for nivolumab in this study was 47 d, with a
random failure type proˆle, while it was 20 d for pembrolizumab with a wear out failure type proˆle.
Cluster analysis was performed to classify the timeto-onset patterns of DILD. The cluster analysis for
small molecule molecularly-targeted drugs showed
that there were 4 clusters in our previous study.37)
Cluster 1 described a subgroup with early to later onset DILD and an early or a random failure type proˆle, which included the proteasome inhibitor, BcrAbl TKI, JAK inhibitor, and ErbB family TKI.
Cluster 2 described a subgroup with early onset DILD
and early failure or a random failure type proˆle,
which included EGFR TKI, ALK TKI, ErbB family
inhibitor, and mTOR inhibitor. Cluster 3 described a
subgroup with a later onset time and random or wear
out failure type proˆles, which included EGFR TKI,
mTOR inhibitor, and ALK TKI. Cluster 4 was
described as a subgroup with the latest onset DILD
and an early or a random failure type proˆle, which
included the multiple receptor TKI with both PDGFR
and VEGFR inhibition. Thus, it appears that the
diŠerences observed between the clusters may indicate
the mechanism of action for some of these small
molecule molecularly-targeted drugs. The present
cluster analysis for monoclonal antibody agents
showed that there were 3 clusters. Cluster 1 describes
a subgroup with a median onset time from 20 to 50 d
and early, random, or wear out failure type proˆles;
these include the chimeric antibody (in‰iximab, and
cetuximab ) , the humanized antibody ( pembrolizumab and bevacizumab), and the human-type
antibody (nivolumab and panitumumab). Cluster 2
describes a subgroup with a median onset time from
55 to 64.5 d and early or random failure type proˆles;
these include the humanized antibody (trastuzumab
and tocilizumab), and the human-type antibody
(golimumab and denosumab). Cluster 3 includes

1592

adalimumab (human-type antibody), which exhibited a random failure type proˆle with a median timeto-onset of the DILD of 126 d. Based on these ˆndings, further research is required to examine the associations between the physicochemical and/or other
properties of monoclonal antibody agents and the
time-to-onset of the DILD.
Abe et al. reported that any interpretation of data
from small sample sizes (notably, less than 100 case
reports) should be performed cautiously, as the variance of the regression line estimated by the Weibull
analysis would be increased when small sample sizes
are present.29) Thus, since there were fewer than 100
case reports for pembrolizumab, golimumab, and
denosumab in this study, the present ˆndings for
these agents may not be conclusive. Secondly, the fact
that the time-to-onset of the DILD in this study was
performed using only 11 agents also needs to be taken
into consideration. It should be noted, however, that
there has been a recent increase in the amount of data
reported for monoclonal antibody agents responsible
for causing DILD, with these cases including information on certolizumab pegol, ipilimumab,
ramucirumab, and other new agents in the JADER
database.
While post-marketing spontaneous reporting of
suspected adverse reactions has been shown to be a
valuable resource, there are several problems associated with spontaneous reporting databases, such
as the JADER, that need to be taken into consideration. These problems include: 1) the size and characteristics of the target population are often unclear,
which indicates that the range of adaptation of the
obtained results cannot be deˆnitively deˆned;
2) despite bias in the information, it is di‹cult to
evaluate the magnitude of the in‰uence; 3) countless
prognostic factors and covariates are confounded,
thereby making it hard to investigate which of these
might have truly in‰uenced the results; 4) there is no
means for conˆrming the causal relationship, even if
a suspected side eŠect is found; and 5) there is
di‹culty ascertaining the accuracy of the report. As a
result, careful attention needs to be paid to any interpretation of the results from the JADER database.30)
In conclusion, the results of our present study
showed that with the exception of denosumab (64.5
d) and adalimumab (126 d), the time-to-onset of
DILD for monoclonal antibody agents ranged from 1
to 2 months after the initial administration. Further-

more, with the exception of pembrolizumab, the onset-patterns for the monoclonal antibody agents were
estimated to be either the early failure type proˆle or
the random failure type proˆle. Perhaps more importantly, our present study was able to demonstrate
the likely range of time in which DILD might be
found, in addition to the most likely time period that
DILD could actually occur in patients after the administration of monoclonal antibody agents. As a
result, these ˆndings could potentially lead to more
concrete pharmacovigilance in the use of these agents.
Finally, to determine the onset of drug-induced
blood disorders at an early stage, the speciˆc time of
monitoring laboratory tests is described in the package insert of small molecule molecularly-targeted
drugs.41) Although the incidence of DILD is described
in the package insert, and included in the interview
form, of monoclonal antibody agents, the time to onset of DILD is not described. During the administration of monoclonal antibody agent therapy, it is important to determine how DILD occurrence varies
over time. It is considered necessary to describe, both
in the package insert and on the interview form, not
only the incidence of side eŠects, but also the time to
onset.
