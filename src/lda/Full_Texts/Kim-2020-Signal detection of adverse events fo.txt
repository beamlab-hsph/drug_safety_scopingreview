Purpose: We aimed to analyze the surveillance reports of adverse events (AEs) due to different types of pneumococcal vaccines,
in addition to detecting and validating signals of pneumococcal vaccines by comparing AEs with labels.
Materials and Methods: We analyzed the percentages of AEs according to vaccine type [pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccines
(PPSVs) and pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCVs)] in children and adults using data from the Korea Adverse Event Reporting System (KAERS) database from 2005 to 2016. A signal was defined as an AE that met all three indices of data mining: proportional reporting ratio (PRR), reporting odds ratio (ROR), and information component (IC). We validated the detected signals by
calculating sensitivity, specificity, as well as positive and negative predictive values of the signals against label information.
Results: Of the 39933 AE reports on vaccination, 5718 (7.0%) were related to pneumococcal vaccine. The most frequent AE after
vaccination with PPSV was fever (23.9%) in children and injection-site reaction in adults. The most frequent AE after vaccination
with PCV in children was pharyngitis (26.2%). In total, 13 AEs met all three indices for signal detection. Among these, hypotension,
apathy, sepsis, and increased serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase level were not listed on vaccine labels. In validation analysis, PRR and ROR performed slightly better than IC for adults who were vaccinated with PPSVs.
Conclusion: Overall, 13 new signals of PPSVs, including four signals not listed on the labels, were detected. Further research
based on additional AE reports is required to confirm the validity of these signals for children.

Korea in 2017, and Streptococcus pneumonia was the leading
cause of bacterial pneumonia.1,2 Despite the use of antibiotics
and intensive care over the past 50 years, the case fatality rate
of pneumococcal bacteremia has remained at 15–20% in children and young adults, and at 30–40% in the elderly.3-5 Moreover, the rates of antimicrobial resistance in various pneumococci have been steadily increasing. Under these circumstances,
vaccination has become the most cost-effective way to prevent
pneumococcal infections.6 The two main types of pneumococcal vaccines are 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide
vaccines (PPSVs) and pneumococcal conjugate vaccines
(PCVs), in which polysaccharides are conjugated to a protein.7
The National Immunization Program (NIP) of South Korea introduced 23-valent PPSVs in 2013 for people aged 65 years and
older,8 and PCVs in 2014 for children under 5 years of age.9
The expansion of NIP appears to have benefited both children

and adults in recent years; in 2017, more than 2 million doses
of pneumococcal vaccines have been administered to both
adults and children.10
Amidst the widespread use of pneumococcal vaccines, it
would be interesting to analyze the difference in adverse events
(AEs) between the two types of vaccines. While the most common adverse reactions after receiving PPSVs were local reactions, such as injection-site pain (soreness, tenderness) (60%),
local swelling or induration (20.3%), headache (17.6%), local
erythema (16.4%), asthenia and fatigue (13.2%), and myalgia
(6.1%), less than 1% of the recipients developed fever or more
severe local reactions.11 In comparison, injection-site reactions
(erythema) occurred in approximately 10% of PCV recipients,
and there may have been an increase in milder injection-site
reactions with subsequent doses in older age groups (12–15
months of age).12 Overall, there was no difference between
PCVs and PPSVs in terms of the incidence of serious adverse
events (SAEs) reported within 1 month of an initial study dose.
While these aforementioned studies evaluated the immunogenicity and safety of PPSVs and PCVs in adults who were older
than 65 years, these studies were limited in that they were randomized clinical trials involving only 1000 older patients.13,14
Therefore, the objective of this study is to analyze AEs after vaccination with different types of pneumococcal vaccines (PPSVs
and PCVs) using a spontaneous AE reporting system, and to
determine the signals of pneumococcal vaccines by comparing the identified signals with data on vaccine labels in South
Korea.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Data sources
The spontaneous AE reporting system was first introduced in
South Korea in 1988 when the Ministry of Food and Drug
Safety started collecting spontaneous AE reports. In 2012, the
Korea Institute of Drug Safety and Risk Management (KIDS)
developed the Korea Adverse Event Reporting System (KAERS)
to facilitate computerized reporting and management of AE
reports.
Data on the AEs of pneumococcal vaccines were taken from
KAERS. The KAERS database contained a total of 39933 reports on AEs after vaccination with pneumococcal vaccines
from January 2005 to December 2016. We classified all reported
AEs into two subgroups: AEs after receiving PPSVs and those
after receiving PCV. We then calculated the percentage of AEs
according to vaccine type by dividing the number of AEs after
receiving each vaccine type (i.e., PPSV and PCV) by the number of AEs after receiving all vaccines, and analyzed the temporal trends of AEs according to the year from 2005 and 2016.
We excluded cases without basic patient data, such as age.

244

Definition of covariates
When comparing the AEs between PPSVs and PCVs, we included a number of covariates such as age, sex, type of reporter, SAE, and degree of causality. Age was divided into following
groups: children aged 0 to 18 years and adults aged ≥19 years
for PPSVs, and only children aged 0 to 18 years for PCVs. This
was because there was only a single case of AE after receiving
PCVs in an adult aged over 18 years in our data. As a result, we
could not compare AEs in adults between PPSVs and PCVs.
Reporters of AEs were categorized into four groups: physician,
pharmacist, nurse, and consumer. SAEs were classified into
death and non-fatal categories. The degree of causality was
classified into seven terms: certain, probable, possible, unlikely, unclassified, unassessable, and not applicable. This categorization was based on the “World Health Organization-Uppsala Monitoring Centre System for standardized case causality
assessment.”15

Coding of AEs
All drug names in the database were coded using the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical classification system, and AEs
were coded using the World Health Organization Adverse Reaction Terminology (WHO-ART, ver. 092). The WHO-ART, developed to serve as a terminology for coding adverse reaction
terms, covers most medical terms needed in AE reporting. Following a hierarchical structure, WHO-ART uses system-organ
classes and preferred terms as the main and sub-categories, respectively. Symptoms that matched the same preferred terms
were treated as the same event. Two or more preferred terms
reported for one patient were counted as different vaccine AEs.
According to the WHO criteria, SAEs were defined as one of
three cases: fatal, causing hospitalization or persistent disability,
and life-threatening.

Signal detection and validation
In pharmacovigilance analyses, data mining is a process of detecting signals to find statistical associations and patterns between drugs and AEs in a large database. Three indicators are
used to detect signals from spontaneously reported data: proportional reporting ratio (PRR), reporting odds ratio (ROR),
and information component (IC). PRR is the proportion of
specific AEs for a particular vaccine divided by the proportion
of specific AEs for other vaccines. ROR is calculated by dividing
the odds of target AEs for patient exposure to a specific vaccine
by those for exposure to other vaccines. For PRR and ROR, a
signal is detected if PRR and ROR values are 2 or higher, χ2 (chisquared) values are 4 or higher, and the number of occurrences is 3 or greater. IC is a logarithmic metric of the value calculated by dividing the probability of target AEs associated with
a target vaccine with the probability of all AEs associated with
all vaccines in the database.16 It is given by a Bayesian confidence propagation neural network. The IC criterion was set at
the lower limit of 95% confidence interval greater than 0. A

signal was defined as the AE that met all three indices of PRR,
ROR, and IC.
The detected signals for each vaccine were compared with
the information on vaccine labels in South Korea to determine
whether the signal was listed on the vaccine label. Assuming
the AE listed on the vaccine label is a true value, we examined
how accurately the signal detected by data mining discriminated the known AE on the label. The detected signals were
validated by calculating four indicators: sensitivity, specificity,
positive predictive value, and negative predictive value.

Statistical analysis
We calculated the frequency and percentage (%) of all categorical variables. The Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel chi-squared test
was used to compare the demographic characteristics. For testing the difference in proportions, we conducted the exact twosided chi-squared test based on the test score.17 All variables
were considered statistically significant if the p-value was lower
than 0.05. SAS (Windows version 9.30, SAS Institute Inc., Cary,
NC, USA) and Excel 2013 (Microsoft Corp., Redmond, WA,
USA) were used to create a dataset and perform all statistical
procedures.

RESULTS
Among the patients vaccinated with PPSVs, females accounted for 62.3% (n=820) of the adult population and 44.9% (n=
801) of the children population (Table 1). An equal number of
male and female children was vaccinated with PCVs. Physicians reported 47.9% and 80.9% of AEs in adults and children
vaccinated with PPSVs, respectively. Moreover, 0.5% (n=6) of
adults and 0.9% of children (n=16) died after receiving PPSVs.
Among the patients vaccinated with PPSVs, 2.9% and 16.2% of
AEs were unlikely to be caused in adults and children, respectively; the causality of another 2.7% and 12.0% of AEs, respectively, was not assessable. Among the children vaccinated
with PCVs, 2.4% of AEs were assessed to be possible to have
been caused by the vaccines, and the causality of another 0.4%
and 0.0% of AEs was assessed as probable and certain, respectively. Most (89.2%) of the adults who were vaccinated with
PPSVs received only one pneumococcal vaccine, whereas 56.7%
and 47.8% of the children who were vaccinated with PPSV
and PCV, respectively, received another vaccine. The median
interval between vaccination date and onset date of AEs was
7, 320, and 532.5 days for adults and children receiving PPSVs
and children receiving PCV, respectively.
Of all the 39933 AE reports after pneumococcal vaccination,
5718 (14.3%) AEs were pneumococcal vaccine-related (Fig. 1).
Injection-site reaction was the most common AE in adults
vaccinated with PPSVs, accounting for 25.0% of all AEs. Respiratory system disorders, as a category, were the most frequent
AEs in children vaccinated with PPSVs or PCVs (Table 2). Fehttps://doi.org/10.3349/ymj.2020.61.3.243

ver occurred frequently in both children and adults vaccinated with PPSVs, accounting for 23.9% and 18.4% of AEs, respectively. The most frequent AE occurring in children after
receiving PCVs was pharyngitis (26.2%), followed by rhinitis
(23.2%).
We summarized the AEs to compare the signals obtained
through this study and labels in Tables 3, 4, and 5. In this study,
signals were considered meaningful when all three criteria
were significant. These signals were detected only in patients
vaccinated with PPSVs. In the case of adults vaccinated with
PPSVs, the most frequently reported AEs, such as injection-site
reaction and fever, were labeled and represented as signals (Table 3). However, in the case of children vaccinated with PPSVs,
the frequently reported respiratory system disorders, such as
pharyngitis and rhinitis, were not mentioned on the labels and

not detected as signals (Table 4).
A total of 13 AEs after pneumococcal vaccination met the criteria of three data mining indices for signal detection. Twelve
AEs reported for adults vaccinated with PPSVs satisfied all
three indices for signal detection; three AEs (hypotension, sepsis, and apathy) were not listed on the vaccine label (Table 3).
In the case of children vaccinated with PPSVs, only one AE
[increased serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT)
level] satisfied all three indices, and it was not listed on the
vaccine label (Table 4). No AE satisfied the criteria for signal
detection in children vaccinated with PCVs (Table 5).
The results of validation analysis show that PRR and ROR
had a sensitivity ranging from 0% to 40% and a specificity from
66.7% to 100% (Table 6). IC had a sensitivity ranging from 0%
to 36% and a specificity from 0% to 100%. For adults vaccinated with PPSVs, PRR and ROR indices performed better than
IC, albeit slightly. However, in comparing the signals for children, the results were not significant as there were cases of
these indices having a value of 0.

DISCUSSION
This study represents a post-marketing safety review of pneumococcal vaccines based on AE reports in KAERS database
between 2005 and 2016. The most common AE was pharyngitis in children vaccinated with PCVs and injection-site reaction in adults vaccinated with PPSVs. These results were consistent with the data on labels of PPSVs and PCVs.18-21 Respiratory

disorders, such as pharyngitis and rhinitis, in children receiving PCVs were mentioned on the vaccine labels in South Korea based on reassessment results. The result that injectionsite reaction was the most frequent AE in adults after receiving
PPSVs was consistent with the findings of previous studies.22-24
A controlled clinical trial involving adults reported that the
degree of injection-site pain was higher for 23-valent PPSVs
than for 13-valent PCVs, but there was no difference in the
percentage of systemic AEs.14 However, a safety profile comhttps://doi.org/10.3349/ymj.2020.61.3.243

parison would yield different results according to research
conditions and target patients. Our comparison of AE reports
showed that the proportion of SAEs reported among children
was similar for both PPSVs and PCVs. However, cases of death
were only reported for PPSVs. In PPSV group, SAEs were reported for a greater proportion of adults than that of children
(18.1% and 7.6%, respectively). Most adults (89.2%) received
only one vaccine whereas 56.7% and 47.8% of the children
vaccinated with PPSVs and PCVs, respectively, received other

vaccines. Nonetheless, the percentage of AEs, for which the
degree of causality was assessed to be more than possible,
was higher for adults than for children. Our findings suggest
that SAEs after pneumococcal vaccination are more frequent
and probably more causal in adults than in children.
We identified 13 new signals for which all three of the data
mining methods used (PRR, ROR, and IC) indicated significant results. Among these, four AEs (hypotension, apathy, sepsis, and increased SGOT level) after PPSV administration were
not listed in the approved label. Hypotension and apathy after
receiving PPSV have not been reported in South Korea or elsewhere, suggesting the need for further studies. Several cases
of sepsis were reported after pneumococcal vaccination; however, they were presumed to have been caused not by the vaccination itself, but by the weakened immunity of the patients.25
Our finding of increased SGOT level was consistent with the
finding of a previous study, which showed that elevated C-reactive protein level after vaccination may cause an increase in
the serum level of hepatic enzymes.26 According to the results
of our validation analysis, PRR and ROR were slightly better
than IC for adults vaccinated with PPSVs. The same results
could not be obtained for children due to the existence of 0 values for these indices in some cases. A future study with more
cases is needed to determine which indicator is appropriate for
signal detection in children.
In our data, pneumonia was reported in both adults and
children who were vaccinated with pneumococcal vaccines.
Although the labels of pneumococcal vaccines list pneumonia as one of the AEs, they only refer to pneumonia caused by
serotypes that are not included in the vaccine. The actual case
of compensation for the occurrence of pneumonia was rejected since the vaccine did not cause systemic infections.27 Therefore, in order to establish the causality between pneumococcal
vaccination and pneumonia, recipients experiencing pneumonia after vaccination should be followed up for serological
studies.
To date, there has been no epidemiological study on AEs
due to pneumococcal vaccinations in South Korea. To the best
of our knowledge, this study is the first to detect signals of AEs
after pneumococcal vaccinations by mining KAERS data. The
KAERS database contains AE data and reassessment results
collected from 27 local monitoring centers in South Korea. In
order to increase the rigor of the current study, we used three
different data mining methods to detect and validate signals
after pneumococcal vaccinations. Due to these strengths, the
findings of this study may be useful for analyzing post-marketing AEs of pneumococcal vaccines.
However, this study had a few limitations. The limitations
with spontaneous reporting data used in this study include
underreporting, inconsistent quality of reports (for example,
reports may lack details and important information or contain
errors), and the lack of non-vaccinated control groups.28 Furthermore, the data we used did not provide information about
https://doi.org/10.3349/ymj.2020.61.3.243

other underlying diseases affecting patients or their recovery
from SAEs. Therefore, additional studies, including literature
reviews, randomized clinical trials, and cohort studies, are required to assess the causality. Moreover, KAERS data did not
provide the specific brand names of the vaccines. As a result,
AE data were analyzed based on vaccine type (PPSVs and PCVs)
only. Finally, although PCVs are currently used for both adults
and children, we could not compare the safety profiles of PCVs
between adults and children, since only a single case of AE in
an adult after receiving PCV was reported in 2016. Further research based on recent data is required to compare the AEs
between children and adults after receiving PCVs. Even for
children who received PCVs, no significant difference was observed between signal information obtained from our data and
the approved label. Addressing the deficiencies highlighted in
this study could lead to better management of AE cases in the
future.
In conclusion, we identified 13 new signals of PPSVs for
which all three data mining methods of PRR, ROR, and IC indicated significant results. Among these, four signals (i.e., hypotension, apathy, sepsis, and increased SGOT level) were
not listed in the approved vaccine label. The results of our validation analysis showed that PRR and ROR were slightly better
than IC for adults vaccinated with PPSVs, although the same
results could not be obtained in children. A future study based
on a larger number of AE reports is needed to confirm the validity of the detected signals for children receiving pneumococcal vaccination.
