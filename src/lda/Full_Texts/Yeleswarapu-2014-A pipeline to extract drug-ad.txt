from multiple data sources

Abstract
Background: Pharmacovigilance aims to uncover and understand harmful side-effects of drugs, termed adverse
events (AEs). Although the current process of pharmacovigilance is very systematic, the increasing amount of
information available in specialized health-related websites as well as the exponential growth in medical literature
presents a unique opportunity to supplement traditional adverse event gathering mechanisms with new-age ones.
Method: We present a semi-automated pipeline to extract associations between drugs and side effects from
traditional structured adverse event databases, enhanced by potential drug-adverse event pairs mined from
user-comments from health-related websites and MEDLINE abstracts. The pipeline was tested using a set of
12 drugs representative of two previous studies of adverse event extraction from health-related websites and
MEDLINE abstracts.
Results: Testing the pipeline shows that mining non-traditional sources helps substantiate the adverse event
databases. The non-traditional sources not only contain the known AEs, but also suggest some unreported AEs for
drugs which can then be analyzed further.
Conclusion: A semi-automated pipeline to extract the AE pairs from adverse event databases as well as potential
AE pairs from non-traditional sources such as text from MEDLINE abstracts and user-comments from health-related
websites is presented.

Background
With the large and growing set of medication drugs, it is
very essential to assess the effects of medication on the patient population at large via information gathering and
analysis. Since there are practical limits on the degree to
which safety of drugs can be established prior to marketing
approval, it is only through such mechanisms that can we
understand the safety and harmful side effects of administered drugs. Typically, pre-marketing safety studies such as
clinical trials are spread over a short duration and restricted to a small and mostly homogeneous study population. Furthermore, side effects of drugs are often revealed
after the drug is out in the market being administered to a

population, sometimes concomitantly with other drugs.
Thus, it is critically important to constantly monitor the
safety of drugs that have been launched in the market. To
provide an objective basis for assessing the safety of marketed drugs, regulatory agencies have in place a postmarketing surveillance mechanism called Pharmacovigilance (PV) [1]. As per World Health Organization (WHO),
PV is defined as “the science and activities relating to the
detection, assessment, understanding, and prevention of
adverse effects or any other drug-related problems” [2,3].
PV is required for systematically identifying causal associations between drugs and side-effects and taking corrective actions, both for new drugs being launched, as well as
for drugs already in use. It is based on the collection of
spontaneously reported Adverse Event (AE) reports. Report initiation by health professionals and consumers is
generally voluntary. However, pharmaceutical companies

are legally obliged to follow up on reports received, and to
cascade these to various regulatory authorities [3,4]. The
Adverse Event Reporting System database maintained by
the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), formerly
called the Adverse Event Reporting System (AERS) and
now referred to as the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) [5], collates all such reports and makes them
available to the public at large [6]. Adverse events can be
reported by pharmaceutical companies, health-care professionals as well as the general public. Such Spontaneous
Reporting Systems (SRS) have certain limitations such as
the potential AE reports being incomplete or inaccurate as
a result of voluntary reporting; cases of biased reporting
or under-reporting; or “Patient Reporter Event and Drug”
(PRED) requirements for submission, geographic marketing and population varying for different drugs [1].
Mining of probable AE pairs in the FDA SRS has also
been well studied [6]. Various studies have also looked at
mining potential AEs from unstructured text sources
such as Electronic Health Records (EHR), health-related
websites and the MEDLINE database [7], serving as a
complement to the SRS systems. Some studies have been
done taking into account electronic health record databases to analyze drug safety such as EU-ADR [8,9],
OMOP [10], Mini-Sentinel [11] as well as databases such
as MEDLINE and Drugbank [12]. These studies show
that combining the same types of data from multiple
sources could help in better detection of potential AEs.
Of course, sources such as EHR are not easily accessible
due to privacy concerns. Another study was done involving the knowledge collected from publicly available
drug-related information sources, UMLS [13], FAERS
and SemMed [14], focusing on the ‘drug-indication’ association [15]. A key aspect when detecting potential
AEs or extracting facts from unstructured text is to verify the results manually. Other studies have focused on
using machine learning-based systems for the identification and extraction of potential AE pairs from MEDLINE case reports and generation relevant corpora
[16,17]. van Mulligen et al. [18] describe the creation of
a database which contains associations between drugs,
disorders and targets mined from MEDLINE abstracts.
These associations at the sentence-level in texts were
further refined and corrected using human annotators.
The motivation for using unstructured text from
health-related websites to extract AE associations are a
consequence of the recent trend of people tending to
blog about their personal experiences more frequently
than reporting them to physicians. Health-related websites allow people to discuss their medical conditions
with one another. A system of informal support in terms
of forums facilitates online discussions among people administered the same/similar drug. Patients and the general
public write about treatment they are undergoing, as well

Page 2 of 16

as respond to queries on treatment, side effects and related issues [9]. Such blogs also serve as indicators to the
usage of drugs which might not be strictly in accordance
with the recommended practices. Monitoring the conversations on these websites can alert pharmaceutical companies and regulatory bodies across the world to potential
AE. A study was conducted by annotating 3600 comments
from the health-related website DailyStrength [19,20]. This
study showed that though user-comments pose a significant Natural Language Processing (NLP) challenge, they
do contain useful information which could be prove beneficial on further exploration.
The studies of Wang et al. [1] and Leaman et al. [20]
are significant for mining potential AEs from unstructured text sources. Wang et al. focused on demonstrating the feasibility of using narrative text in EHRs and
association statistics for PV to detect novel AEs using
NLP. They used the MedLEE (Medical Language Extraction and Encoding) system for extracting and encoding
information in clinical narratives such as the discharge
summaries of inpatients. Their study was built on their
previous work by adapting a combination of NLP and
statistical methods to acquire potential AE associations.
A chi-square test adjusted with volume was used on the
co-occurring AE pairs to determine possible signals from
them [1]. This work provided a possible method to establish safety profiles from unstructured patient data for
a drug during its market life. However, it does not leverage the large amount of data available in health-related
websites.
Leaman et al. [20] studied the validity of identifying
associations between drugs and AEs reported by patients
in the user comments of health-related websites. They
implemented an automatic web crawler in their study
that efficiently gathered user comments about specific
drugs from the DailyStrength website. A dictionary compiled from four different sources viz COSTART vocabulary [21], SIDER side effects [22], the Canadian Drug
Adverse Reaction Database MedEffect [23] and UMLS
concept identifiers [13] - was used to extract the adverse
drug reactions from these user comments. This work
concluded that while mining user comments does pose
significant challenges, these comments contain information that could prove to be useful in PV. However, the
study does not include mining MEDLINE abstracts, as
also using AE pairs from traditional SRS databases.
There is a need for a pipeline that can integrate data
from traditional SRS databases such as the FAERS, usercomments from health-related websites as well as MEDLINE abstracts to detect potential AEs and provide
biological context to these potential AEs. These potential
AE pairs should then be compared with those listed in
the label information of the drugs. Finally, statistical
techniques will be used to determine the significant AE

pairs. Our objective in this study is to develop a pipeline
that can handle these requirements.

Methods
The following steps were carried out:
1. Creating the complete pipeline.
2. Running the pipeline on the sources of data like the
MEDLINE abstracts and the user comments from
health-websites, respectively. As a pre-processing
step, this involved obtaining the drug-AE pairs from
each of the three sources. For MEDLINE abstracts
and user-comments, these pairs are obtained using
the Association Map module of PV-TPX. For the
FAERS database, the drug pairs were obtained from
the FDA datasets.
3. Running the BCPNN algorithm on the drug-AE
pairs from individual sources.
4. Comparative analysis of the results from the
BCPNN results in order to identify the potential
adverse events for the drugs.
TPX framework

We have previously developed TCS Pubmed eXplorer
(TPX) [24], a web-based tool that supports conceptassisted search and navigation based on PubMed as the
underlying search engine, to search the MEDLINE database. Although the focus of the TPX pipeline is better
search of MEDLINE using PubMed, certain components
of the TPX pipeline are generic and can be re-used in
many biomedical tasks. We have taken relevant components of TPX for the semi-automated pipeline for AE
event detection. In addition, we have developed new modules for tasks. TPX has 16 concept types, of these the drug,
disease and symptom dictionaries were used in this study.
Additionally, the annotation server was re-used with major
modifications. A modified version of the TPX framework,
hereon referred to as PV-TPX, was used in this study.
Named-entity-recognition

One of the most significant tasks was the identification
of drug and adverse event mentions in text from both
MEDLINE as well as health-related websites using
Named-Entity-Recognition (NER). The NER module of
PV-TPX is based on that of TPX and uses dictionarybased NER techniques for identifying various biological
entities in text. The PV-TPX NER module is part of the
Annotation server that receives the unstructured textual
content and performs a wide range of text-mining tasks.
It was implemented in Java and used as a REST/SOAP
based Web Service [25,26]. The following components
of the NER module were used for processing the text:

Page 3 of 16

 Part-Of-Speech (POS) Tagger: PV-TPX uses the Java

implementation of the open source MedPost POS
tagger [27] from NCBI, which is an HMM based
POS tagger for parts-of-speech tagging in medical
text.
 Stemmer and Tokenizer: PV-TPX uses the Porter
stemmer algorithm for stemming [28]. An in-house
implementation of tokenizer and sentence splitter
is used for tokenization and sentence splitting
respectively.
 Acronym Handler: PV-TPX also identifies local
abbreviations by keeping track of such abbreviation
definitions. The expansion of the abbreviations is
usually specified in the article abstract, while the
abbreviated form is used in the article title. Hence
the abstract is tagged before the title and all the local
abbreviations detected in the abstract were extended
to the title tagging.
Dictionary compilation

An inherent task for accomplishing NER was building
the dictionaries to be used in the pipeline. While TPX
uses dictionaries for various biological entities such as
genes, proteins, diseases and drugs, none of them could
be used as-is for this study. Instead, a drug dictionary
and an event dictionary consisting of disease and symptom terms for identifying AEs were built as follows:
1. A drug dictionary is based on the TPX drug dictionary
but enhanced with synonym/variants/brand names.
The additional synonyms or variants for each of these
that were compiled from sources such as MeSH [29].
Although not a formal input source, Wikipedia [30]
data was used to cross-check some of the brand
names as it proved to have significant brand names
mentioned.
2. An event dictionary that consists of disease and
symptom terms for identifying AEs. The event
dictionary is primarily derived by merging TPX
disease dictionary and TPX symptom dictionary [24].
Further, MedDRA [31] was used as an important
source for enhancing the event dictionary since
medication errors reported to FAERS are coded to
terms in the MedDRA terminology. Hence, the
MedDRA Preferred Term (PT) and Low Level Term
(LLT) were also added to the event dictionary. To
reconcile disparate mentions of named entities,
normalization was done on the event dictionary as
follows. For an exact match of the MedDRA term
with the dictionary term, all the synonyms of that
MedDRA PT were added as synonyms to the
dictionary term. For MedDRA terms that do not
have an exact match in the dictionary, the terms
were added as separate entries in the dictionary.

Yeleswarapu et al. BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making 2014, 14:13
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6947/14/13

Only exact matches were handled here and no
pattern matching was involved. For instance,
MedDRA terms such as ‘abdominal discomfort’,
‘abnormal dreams’ and ‘acute psychosis’ that did not
have an exact match in the dictionary were added to
it as separate entries.
Entity association module

TPX has a pairwise concept association module incorporated. The Concept association module reads the entity
annotations for the entire MEDLINE and then computes
pairwise associations between the biological entities.
Thus, these associations are pre-computed and ranked
according to their relevance to the whole of the tagged
MEDLINE corpus. Additionally, the associations are
scored based on co-occurrence within the abstracts. The
scoring method is as follows: For an entity e, let A(e) =
{a1, …., ak} denote the set of abstracts e is mentioned.
Let t1, …, tm denote the set of all entities other than e
mentioned in abstracts belonging to A(e). Let A denote
the set of all abstracts. For an entity ti, let N(ti, A) denote
the total number of occurrence of ti in the abstracts in
A. Similarly let N(ti, A(e)) denote the corresponding
number of occurrence of ti in the abstract collection A
(e). The association score P(ti|e) denotes the probability
that ti is relevant given the entity e, is estimated using
the standard tf-idf score as follows:
Bðt i jeÞ
Pðt i jeÞ ¼ Xm 
B t j jeÞ
j¼1
where Bðt i jeÞ ¼ N ðt i ; AðeÞÞ log



N þ1
N ðt i ; AÞ



where N is the sum total of the frequency of all the
entities in the abstract collection A.
In PV-TPX, the pairwise associations between the
identified entities were calculated using a PV-TPX specific pairwise entity association map. These pairwise associations are computed for the MEDLINE corpus as
described above, where each abstract accounts for one
document. However, each individual user comment and
its responses from the health-related websites is considered as one document while computing the pairwise associations for this corpus. The resultant set for each
corpus contains the drug-disease and drug-symptom
pairs which were then processed to identify the potential
AE pairs.
BCPNN algorithm

The statistical BCPNN algorithm is used as the means
for signal detection in the pipeline. It uses a neural network architecture to measure dependencies between entities in a dataset of AE pairs. BCPNN can be used to

Page 4 of 16

detect unexpected patterns in input data and to examine
how such patterns vary over time [32]. It uses a disproportionality measure known as Information Component
(IC). In BCPNN, node activations represent probability
or confidence in the presence of input features, and synaptic weights are based on estimated correlations and
the spread of activation corresponds to calculating posterior probabilities [33]. The variance values are relevant
when the data is varying and not static.
The BCPNN algorithm has been implemented in Java
for this pipeline, which takes as input, a matrix of the
drug-AE associations and their frequency of occurrence
in that particular source. The output from this is an IC
variance value for each drug-AE pair, which is analyzed
manually to obtain the potential drug-adverse event
pairs. After the identification of drug and symptom or
disease pairs from each source, this data arranged in a
matrix form, which is the required input format for running the BCPNN algorithm. This implementation provides the ‘variance’ values for the IC for each of the AE
pairs. The IC value in each source is based on the total
number of documents in the set with drug X (Cx); the
total number of documents with AE entity Y (Cy); the
number of documents with the specific AE combination
(Cxy); and the total number of documents in that source.
A variation in the data may cause the IC to either increase or decrease. The standard deviation for each IC
provides a measure of the robustness of the value. Large
values of Cx, Cy and Cxy indicate smaller confidence
intervals.
The IC is thus a measure of the strength of the dependency between a drug and an AE [33]. A positive IC
value indicates that a particular AE combination is reported to the database more often than expected from
the rest of the reports in the database. An IC value of
zero indicates that there is no quantitative dependency
between the AE combinations while a negative IC value
indicates that the combination is reported to the database less frequently than statistically expected. The
higher value of the IC, the more the combination stands
out from the background. If the IC value increases over
time and the value is positive, the positive quantitative
association between the drug and the adverse e is likely
to be high.
Data acquisition

Data acquisition, which involved identifying the structured and unstructured sources of data for these drugs
and collecting the data to be mined from them. Data acquisition from unstructured sources was done using the
PV-TPX pipeline, which in turn involved processing the
data from the different sources to identify entities and
finding the associations amongst these entities. The drug
and event dictionaries were used to identify entities.

Structured-data acquisition

The FAERS database was used as the source of structured data. The FDA releases Adverse Event Reaction information on a quarterly basis. The drug, reaction,
indication, outcomes, report sources, therapy and demographics files have been extracted from each quarter’s
archive and loaded into a relational database. The drugAE pairs have been obtained from the drug and reaction
tables based on the Individual Safety Report (ISR) field.
Duplicates were eliminated and unique drug-AE pairs
were obtained for each ISR and case-id. Demographics
information such as ISR, case-id, initial or follow-up
code, age, gender, event date and reporting date were
used for selecting unique records. The initial and followup cases were considered as two different instances of
the association.
Before performing association mining on the data,
normalization was done by comparing each of the drug
and AE entities with the baseline dictionary and using
the generic names or common synonyms for them. If
the reaction or AE entity matched with the dictionary
term, then the dictionary entry was used, otherwise the
reaction entity was used as-is for further processing.
The FAERS files from the first quarter of 2008 to the first
quarter of 2012 were obtained from the FDA website for
this study. Therefore, the data was divided into three categories to observe the variance. The three categories are:
1. The complete set of data for each data source:
FAERS data for all quarters from Q1 2008 to Q1
2012, all the blogs from the three health-related
websites and all the abstracts from MEDLINE.
2. Data between January 01, 2008 and December 31,
2009: The FAERS drug-PT pairs with the FDA
reported date within the given date range, the blogs
from PatientsLikeMe and Mediguard with dates in
the given range, the complete Dailystrength blogs
and AE pairs from MEDLINE abstracts that have
publication dates in the given range.
3. Data between January 01, 2010 and March 31, 2012:
Similar to the above set.
Unstructured-data acquisition

The user comments from health-related websites “PatientsLikeMe” [34], DailyStrength [19] and MediGuard [35]
were used as sources of unstructured text. These blogs
were crawled using Web-Harvest, an open-source web
data extraction tool [36]. The user comments, reviews and
replies were retrieved from these websites for the predefined set of drugs. These blogs also provide some user
information such as the user-name, age, gender and
demographics. However, since the study does not aim at
categorizing the results based on these parameters, none
of this additional information was used for processing.

Page 5 of 16

The other source of unstructured text is the MEDLINE
database, which has over 23 million abstracts [7] Figure 1.
Testing the pipeline

The pipeline takes about 36 hours for processing the entire MEDLINE corpus and nearly 20 minutes for the
13,500 user comments from the health-related websites.
This includes the steps involving NER tasks such as POS
tagging, stemming, tokenization, acronym handling and
computing the entity association pairs.
A set of 12 drugs, which is the union of drugs that were
used by Wang et al. [1] and Leaman et al. [20] in their
study, was used for testing the pipeline (Table 1). The drugs
include: Bupropion, Carbamazepine, Olanzapine, Ciprofloxacin, Trazodone, Ziprasidone, Aspirin, Ibuprofen, Warfarin,
Paroxetine, Rosiglitazone and Morphine. Bupropion is an
atypical anti-depressant and a smoking cessation agent
[37]. Carbamazepine, Olanzapine, Trazadone, Ziprasidone
and Paroxetine are different kinds of anti-psychotic or antidepressant drugs. Ciprofloxacin is an anti-biotic; Aspirin,
Ibuprofen and Morphine are different types of analgesic or
anti-inflammatory drugs. Rosiglitazone is an anti-diabetic
and Warfarin is an anticoagulant.
The label information for each of these 12 drugs was obtained from the FDA website. These sections containing
the prescribing or label information vary from drug-todrug. Therefore depending on the information available
in the files obtained from the FDA website, the sections
used were the “Adverse Reactions”, “Warnings”, “Boxed
Warning”, “Precautions” and “Use in Specific Populations”. A comparative analysis of the label information for
each of the drugs was done with the AE pairs obtained.
The BCPNN algorithm was applied to the AE associations from the three sources - FAERS, health-related websites and MEDLINE abstracts. The AE pairs with positive
variance values across these categories were considered as
potential signals for further analysis. PERL scripts were
used to create a tabular view of results for comparison
and analysis. Further, the results were grouped manually
for reporting.

Results
Table 2 shows the results of the pipeline for Bupropion, in
comparison with the results indicated by Wang et al. A
comparative analysis of the results is reported for Bupropion as a representative out of the 12 drugs used for testing the pipeline. Wang et al. depict their qualitative
evaluation of the results under four classes of associations
into which the experts categorize the results obtained
from their methods. The results for the other drugs is
available as supplementary file (Additional file 1).

Also, unique AEs were reported for Bupropion, such as
“airway obstruction” and “breathlessness” in blogs, which
might result from known reactions such as “angioedema”.
One of the common trends noticed from these top
scoring events for the drugs used in this study as listed
in Table 4 is that in FAERS only the side effects or adverse events were high scoring, while in the other two
sources some of the drug indications came up with a
high score. This is possible because in these unstructured sources, the patients could have mentioned the
reason for which the drug was administered or the early
signs and symptoms they noticed for which the drug
was prescribed.
Table 5 contains the top scoring adverse events across
the three sources for anti-depressant/anti-psychotic class
of drugs used in this study, which are prescribed for
neurological problems. There are a few noticeable results. For example, side effects such as cardiac disorders,
sleep disorders and priapism come up as high scoring
ones for an anti-depressant drug such as Trazadone.
Heart diseases also show up as high-scoring adverse
events for an anti-diabetic drug such as Rosiglitazone.
The results also show the association pairs WarfarinINR, Warfarin-BCR and Warfarin-Vitamin K among the
top scoring ones. Warfarin is an anti-coagulant commonly
used to prevent thrombosis and thromboembolism, the formation of blood clots in the blood vessels and their migration elsewhere in the body, respectively. International
Normalized Ratio (INR) is a measure of a pathway of coagulation while BCR is the test for blood clotting response.
And, it is known that vitamin K is required for blood coagulation. Hence, the addition of MedDRA terms to the

-

entity dictionary has contributed to Vitamin K showing up
as a top scoring result, even though it is not really a disease or symptom term or even an adverse event by itself.
The supplementary material contains the comparative
analysis of the pipeline results with the label information
for some of the drugs, along with the top scoring results
for the remaining drugs.

Discussion
A semi-automated PV pipeline was built in this study,
which includes an in-house application TPX. This pipeline
serves as a framework for normalization of input from
multiple sources and a semi-automated extraction of potential AE pairs from them. The pipeline was tested with a
set of 12 drugs drawn from Wang et al. [1] and Leaman
et al. [20]. An analysis of the top scoring results for each
of these drugs shows that the three sources individually
contribute to the identification of drug-adverse event pairs
and that no single source caters completely to the potential drug-adverse event pairs all by itself. However, two
patterns emerge from the comparative analysis of the
BCPNN results of blogs with the label and FAERS results:
1. Some of the AEs reported in blogs were more
specific when compared to the label information.
2. Some unique AEs were found in the health-related
websites
The data sources used in this study are the validated
set of AE pairs from FAERS, medical literature from
MEDLINE and blog content health-related websites
PatientsLikeMe, Mediguard and DailyStrength. These
selected sources are only examples for each type of data

and by no means implies that these are the authoratative sources for such data. There are other medical
literature sources (PMC) or social media (other healthrelated websites) that could be of equal, if not more,
value.
The blogs in health-related websites are not grammatically correct by nature. The language used can be very
complex with varying writing styles. The format, structure, and style continuously evolve over time. Moreover,
these blogs may not completely abide by the guidelines
for AE reporting such as fulfilling the basic PRED criteria; which may not be entirely reliable. Also, they may
not be validated by a trained investigator, the seriousness
of the AE may not be explicitly specified, there might
occur a considerable time-delay before being mentioned
in the blog, they could be reported by a third-party or
may have occurred concomitantly. However, the main
topics of discussion in blogs of the health-related websites are medications, physiology and disorders. It has
been observed that patients are concerned by medication, while physicians rather focus on illnesses [38].
Some components of the pipeline involve manual
tasks. The pre-processing stage that involves data preparation contains a few manual steps. The user comments
from the health-related websites were obtained using the
Web-Harvest tool. This tool requires the scripts for data
extraction to be written in xml. The user comments,

thus obtained for each drug, were further broken down
into individual records using a Perl script. PV-TPX is
run on these individual records, each considered as a
document. The post-processing stage, after the identification of drug and symptom or disease pairs, also involves some manual tasks such as preparing this data in
a matrix form, which is the required input format for
running the BCPNN algorithm. Also, the results obtained from the BCPNN algorithm were sorted based on
their IC variance values and were then manually analyzed to identify the potential drug-adverse event pairs,
for each drug across each of the sources.
Mining user comments from health-related websites
helps avoid the time-consuming process of getting formal
ethical approval for involving patients in direct primary research [39]. However, there is the issue of ethics as a concern while using data from such websites. In fact, a
number of ethical considerations concerning the reporting
of data obtained from the Internet have already been discussed and reported at great length by others [40-42].
There is however a growing consensus among researchers
that if Internet data is freely and publicly accessible, then
it can be used for considered research without prior
approval. Based on this, data taken from the Internet have
in fact been widely used already [39]. Most often users
post to health-related websites with their user-names or
other handles without disclosing any personal information.

Since such personal information of the reporting person
such as name, age and other demographics are not used
or reported as part of the results of the study, the ethical
issues such as privacy should not pose a significant
concern.
Spam and malicious posts could affect to the content of
such health-related websites and hence bias the results of
any such analysis. However, unlike most regular blogs and
bulletin boards, these health-related websites have moderators looking at content posted by users and removing
such content, when encountered. For example, DailyStrength has a policy against both spammers and trolls.
It defines spammers and trolls as follows: a spammer is
someone who posts prolifically on dailystrength and on
the comment systems in order to promote links or products, often of a commercial interest while a troll is someone who posts with the intent to rile up communities,
provokes others into arguments or attacks, steers discussions off-topic and prevents them from being helpful, or
disrupts and pollutes a support group with negativity.
There has been an increase in the number of commercial
websites developed aiming to aggregate user comments

from various health-related websites to obtain potential AE
pairs. Treato is an example of one such website, which
automatically collects the large amount of patient-written
health experiences from health-related websites and uses
advanced NLP to extract relevant information and create a
comprehensive picture of what people say about their
medications and conditions [43]. The website displays all
the AE pairs as part of the results. An important aspect of
our pipeline, when compared to Treato, is the grouping of
AEs based on different criteria, such as synonyms or variants of other AEs. In the absence of an ontology for
normalization, this step is critical for the identification and
comparative analysis of AEs in the final results. Lack of
such grouping results in presenting an incorrect picture.
Treato, for example, displays the results for individual AEs
separately with no grouping For example, “drowsy” and
“sleepy” are reported as two separate AEs for Bupropion in
Treato, thus displaying a larger number of AEs, even
though they are inter-related.
The statistical algorithm BCPNN, which was applied
in this work, generates association rules based on frequency. Many such quantitative methods have been used

The scores here are the variance values obtained from running the BCPNN algorithm on the drug-AE pairs.

on SRS databases to detect and predict potential AE pairs.
For example, the FDA uses Multi-item Gamma Poisson
Shrinker (MGPS) to detect potential AE signals in its MedWatch program [44]. The UK Medicines Control Agency
adopts Proportional Reporting Ratio (PRR) and Chi-square
statistic to identify AE signals [45]. The Netherlands Pharmacovigilance Centre Lareb uses the Reporting Odds Ratio
[46] and the Uppsala Monitoring Center employs Bayesian
Confidence Propagation Neural Network (BCPNN) as its
signal detection method on the WHO database [47]. While
all these different methods have the ability to detect potential AE pairs, BCPNN is seen to have the best performance when compared to PRR and MGPS [48]. Hence, we
decided to implement and incorporate BCPNN in our
pipeline.
Of course, there are some drawbacks of using BCPNN
or some statistical algorithms in general. The IC value in
BCPNN does not give any information about the causality of an AE combination. The positive quantitative association between the drug and the AE is likely to be high,
although clinical assessment remains essential. Typically,
rare associations are not frequently reported. However,
BCPNN works sufficiently well as the data augmentation
from blogs and MEDLINE abstracts add up for these associations, which were traditionally viewed only from
FAERS as rare ones. Hence, even to detect infrequent
signals from multiple sources, we propose that our pipeline can be used.
The pipeline is not a fully-automated one. Some components of the pipeline involve manual tasks. The preprocessing stage that involves data preparation contains a
few manual steps. The user comments from the healthrelated websites were obtained using the Web-Harvest
tool. This tool requires the scripts for data extraction to be
written in xml. The user comments, thus obtained for each
drug, were further broken down into individual records

using a Perl script. PV-TPX is run on these individual
records, each considered as a document. The postprocessing stage, after the identification of drug and
symptom or disease pairs, also involves some manual
tasks such as preparing this data in a matrix form,
which is the required input format for running the
BCPNN algorithm. Also, the results obtained from the
BCPNN algorithm were sorted based on their IC variance values and were then manually analyzed to identify
the potential drug-adverse event pairs, for each drug
across each of the sources.

Conclusion
We have built a semi-automated pipeline to extract the AE
pairs from adverse event databases, enhanced by potential
drug-adverse event pairs mined from non-traditional
sources such as text from MEDLINE abstracts and usercomments from health-related websites. Testing the pipeline shows that although these non-traditional sources by
themselves cannot be alternatives for AE detection, mining
such sources helps substantiate the adverse event databases. They not only contain the known AEs, but also suggest unknown and unreported AEs for drugs, which can
be analyzed further. While pharmaceutical companies may
not want to incorporate these kinds of tools in their PV
programs, the pipeline could prove to be useful for better
PV by regulatory agencies, albeit with greater validations
in place.
Future work

The amount of automation in the pipeline can be increased, thus extending the semi-automated pipeline
used for the current study. However, manual intervention will always be required. A weighting scheme for
assigning more weight to associations from FAERS over
associations from unstructured text can be designed and

Table 5 Top scoring adverse events for a class of drugs in this study, which are anti-depressant/ antipsychotic drugs prescribed for neurological problems,
across the three different sources

The scores here are the variance values obtained from running the BCPNN algorithm on the drug-AE pairs.

incorporated into the system before associations are reported. Another challenge is to successfully differentiate
between indications, symptoms of these indications, and
known contraindications. Also, a hierarchical representation or an ontology of the AEs can be built, in order to
group them for further analysis.
