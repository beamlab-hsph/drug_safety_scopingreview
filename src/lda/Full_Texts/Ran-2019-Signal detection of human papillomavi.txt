Abstract
Background Adverse events (AEs) not listed on drug labels have recently been reported in young girls vaccinated against HPV,
but signal detection related to the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine has never been conducted in South Korea using the
Korea Adverse Event Reporting System database of Korea Institute of Drug Safety & Risk Management at Ministry of Food
and Drug Safety. Objective To analyze signals associated with HPV vaccines using the Korean spontaneous AEs reporting
system and data-mining methods and compare the results to current vaccine label information in South Korea and the United
States of America, United Kingdom, European Union, and Japan to detect signals not currently listed on the labels. Setting
We evaluated the Korea Institute of Drug Safety & Risk Management database from January 2005 to December 2016. After
pre-screening the data, the adjusted total numbers of HPV-related AE reports and AEs were 2566 and 4748 and those of all
other vaccine-related AE reports and AEs were 21,878 and 120,688, respectively. Methods Three data mining algorithms
(proportional reporting ratio, reporting odds ratio and information component) were used to assess AEs. A signal was defined
when the criteria for all three indicators were satisfied. The detected signals were compared to the label information of HPV
vaccines from South Korea, the United States of America, United Kingdom, European Union, and Japan. Main outcome
measure Signals of AE after HPV vaccination, which met all three data mining indices. Results In this study, we found a total
97 signals of AE after HPV vaccination. Of these, 78 AEs were already present on the HPV vaccine labels of South Korea
and the following 19 AEs were not listed: neuralgia, tremor, neuritis, depersonalization, axillary pain, personality disorder,
increased salivation, peptic ulcer, circulatory failure, hypotension, peripheral ischemia, cerebral hemorrhage, micturition
disorder, facial edema, ovarian cyst, weight increase, pain anxiety, oral edema, and back pain. Moreover, AE information on
the current HPV vaccine labels of South Korea, the United States of America, United Kingdom, European Union, and Japan
was inconsistent. When comparing the 19 AE signals that were not listed on the drug label in South Korea with the labels
from the other countries, neuritis, axillary pain, cerebral hemorrhage, facial edema, pain anxiety, and back pain appreared
on the U.S. Food and Drug Administration HPV vaccine labels but not on the United Kingdom labels, and hypotension was
listed only on labels in the European Union and Japan. Conclusions South Korea should develop a system for proactively
updating HPV labels. These results also suggest potential research directions such as vaccination label expansion, pharmacovigilance studies, and identification of causality in AEs associated with HPV vaccination.

Introduction
Cervical cancer is the fourth most common cancer among
women worldwide, causing approximately 266,000 deaths
each year [1]. Since the introduction of the first human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine, cervical cancer has become one
of the few cancers that can be prevented. More than 200
million doses of HPV vaccines have been administered to
women [2], and HPV vaccines are included in the immunization programs of 71 countries [3]. Many HPV vaccine
safety studies have reported no safety concerns and a favorable risk-benefits profile of HPV vaccines [3–12]. However,
numerous countries have received reports alleging the association of HPV vaccination with a variety of adverse events
(AEs); recently, the media reported a case of hypokinesia
(abnormally decreased motion), serious neurological deficits (paraparesis and paraplegia), brain disease, and death
in young women administered the HPV vaccine [2, 13–15].
Most of AE listed on HPV vaccine labels were observed
in clinical trials and post-marketing surveillance studies;
however, additional AEs may occur in the ‘real-world’. In
fact, AEs recently reported by the media in young girls who
have been vaccinated for HPV are new and not listed on the
current HPV vaccine label in South Korea. A signal in pharmacovigilance is a hypothesis regarding the risk of medicine
use, with supporting data and arguments. The World Health
Organization Uppsala Monitoring Center (WHO-UMC)
defined a signal as “Reported information on a possible
causal relationship between an AE and a drug; the relationship being unknown or incompletely documented previously
[16].” The evidence for a signal is not conclusive, but the
signal detection process may reveal previously unrecognized
or incompletely documented suspected adverse drug reactions (ADRs) [17]. However, signal detection related to HPV
vaccine has never been conducted in South Korea using the
Korean spontaneous AE reporting system database. Therefore, we analyzed signals associated with HPV vaccines by
using the Korean spontaneous AEs reporting system and
data-mining methods and compared the results with current
vaccine label information in South Korea and the USA, UK,
EU, and Japan to detect signals not currently listed on the
labels. These results provide the latest safety information on
HPV vaccines in South Korea and further research directions
for unlabeled signal information.

Aim of the study
The purpose of this study was to detect signals of AEs after
HPV vaccination using the Korea Adverse Events Reporting
System (KAERS) database.

Methods
Database and study drug
The KAERS system was developed by Korea Institute of Drug
Safety & Risk Management (KIDS) to facilitate the reporting
and management of AE reports in South Korea. All spontaneous AE reports have been added to the KAERS since 1988.
We therefore used data for spontaneous AEs reports related to
HPV vaccines and all other vaccines listed in the KAERS database. The data were collected from January 2005 to December
2016 and were pre-screened for missing medication information, missing Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) codes,
and initially unreported cases by drug and AE information
before performing statistical analysis. The provided KAERS
database included general information, suspected drug information, adverse drug reaction codes, serious adverse drug
reaction cases, reporter information, and causality assessment information. The drugs were coded according to the ATC
classification system, which is managed by the World Health
Organization Collaborating Center for Drug Statistics Methodology. We also coded suspected AEs according to the System
Organ Class and Preferred Terms, which are two out of four
classified levels of the WHO Adverse Reactions Terminology
092 (WHO-ART 092). The WHO-ART was developed and
maintained by the WHO-UMC for approximately 30 years for
coding adverse reaction terms, including most medical terms
required to report AEs [18].

Definition of AE reports and AEs
In general, more than one AE can be listed in each AE report.
For example, after vaccine administration, patient ‘A’ can
report multiple symptoms at once, such as dizziness, headache, and injection site pruritus. In this case, the number of AE
reports is one, but several AEs are listed on each AE report.
In this study, we investigated the frequency of AEs associated
with HPV vaccines and all other vaccines (all other vaccines
include adolescent vaccines and infant vaccines) using Preferred Term codes.

Data mining indices
Data mining is a technique used to detect signals in large
databases, which includes the proportional reporting
ratio (PRR), reporting odds ratio (ROR), and information

International Journal of Clinical Pharmacy (2019) 41:1365–1372

1367

component (IC) of the Bayesian Confidence Propagation
Neural Network. The PRR is the ratio of the proportion
of a specific AE divided by all AEs observed for the drug
of interest to the proportion of this AE divided by all AEs
observed for all other drugs in the database. The ROR is the
odds of a specific AE occurring in a patient exposed to a
drug of interest divided by the odds of occurrence of an AE
specific to another drug. The IC is a logarithmic metric of
the value which is calculated by dividing the probability of
drug use and a specific AE by the product of the probability of drug use and probability of a specific AE occurring
when drug use and specific AE occurring are independent.
The criteria for signal detection were a PRR or ROR ≥ 2,
χ2 values (Chi square value) ≥ 4, and number of AEs ≥ 3.
The IC value was set as the 95% confidence interval, and
the lower limit was greater than 0 [19–22]. PRR, ROR, and
IC were calculated using 2 × 2 contingency tables for drugevent counts; that is, HPV vaccines and all other vaccines
were placed on the rows and specific AEs and all other AEs
were categorized in columns. In this study, we used three
data mining algorithms (PRR, ROR, and IC) to assess AEs,
and a signal was defined when it satisfied the criteria for all
three indicators (PRR, ROR, and IC).

Results

Label information for HPV vaccines was confirmed using
the website of the Korea Ministry of Food and Drug Safety
(MFDS), U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Medicines
and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency in the UK,
European Medicines Agency, and Pharmaceuticals and
Medical Devices Agency in Japan [23–34].

Statistical analysis
We analyzed the number of AE reports and AEs following administration of the HPV vaccine and all other vaccines. The demographic characteristics of gender, age, and
reporter among the basic reports’ information were analyzed. In South Korea, the ages at which men and women
were administered the HPV vaccine were 9–26 years, but the
inoculated available age was up to 54 years old; therefore,
subjects were divided into 5 sub-groups based on age: under
9, 9–27, 28–45, and over 46 years and unknown (Table 1).
Signals satisfying the criteria for all three indicators
(PRR, ROR, and IC) were selected and compared to the
label information of the HPV vaccine from South Korea, the
USA, UK, EU, and Japan. All statistical analyses were performed using SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC, USA)
and Excel 2010 (Microsoft Corp., Redmond, WA, USA).

The total numbers of AE reports and AEs for all vaccines
accumulated in the KEARS between January 2005 and
December 2016 were 25,010 and 131,113, respectively.
After pre-screening of the data (excluding data with missing ATC/AEs codes and only the initially reported case),
the adjusted total numbers of AE reports and AEs for all
vaccines were 24,104 and 125,436, respectively. During
the same period, the numbers of HPV-related AE reports
were 2566 and AEs were 4748, while those of all other
vaccine-related AE reports and AEs were 21,878 and
120,688, respectively (Fig. 1).
The characteristics of AEs for HPV vaccines are presented in Table 1. All characteristics differed between
HPV vaccines and all other vaccines. In terms of gender,
the proportion of women was higher than that of men:
4540 (95.6%) subjects were female and 44 (0.9%) were
male. In subgroup analysis by age, HPV-related AEs were
reported as follows: 2 reports in subjects under 9 years
(0.0%), 1713 reports in subjects 9–27 years (36.1%), 737
reports in subjects 28–45 years (15.5%), 115 reports in
subjects over 46 years (2.4%), and 2181 reports in subjects of unknown age (45.9%). A large proportion of AEs
was generated by health professionals [physicians in 2435
cases (51.3%), pharmacists in 50 cases (1.1%), and nurses
in 601 cases (12.7%)] (Table 1).

The frequency of AEs associated with HPV vaccines
and all other vaccines with respect to the WHO-ART System Organ Class are presented in Supplementary Table 1.
Among the 4748 AEs, the most common events associated
with HPV vaccines were 1278 cases (28%) of application
site disorders, followed by 564 cases (13%) of body as a
whole/general disorders, 439 cases (9%) of central and
peripheral nervous system disorder, 277 cases (7%) of gastrointestinal system disorders, and 262 cases (6%) of skin
and appendage disorders. Among the 120,688 cases of AEs
reported for all other vaccines, the most common were
application site disorders (19,468 cases, 17%), followed by
19,248 cases (16%) of body as a whole/general disorders,
4688 cases (4%) of reproductive disorder, 3642 cases (3%)
of resistance mechanism disorders, 3000 cases (2%) of gastrointestinal system disorders, 2210 cases (2%) of central
and peripheral nervous system disorders, and 2196 cases
(2%) of fetal disorders.
In data-mining analysis, the number of signals detected
by the PRR and ROR method was 97 individually and 220
by the IC method. Finally, 97 signals satisfied the criteria
of all three data mining indices. Among them, 78 AEs are
already presented on the HPV vaccine labels of South Korea
and 19 AEs were not listed: tremor (49 cases), back pain (15
cases), neuritis (12 cases), hypotension (12 cases), circulatory failure (11 cases), pain axillary (11 cases), neuralgia (9
cases), facial edema (7 cases), ovarian cyst (6 cases), micturition disorder (6 cases), cerebral hemorrhage (5 cases),

increased salivation (4 cases), personality disorder (4 cases),
axillary pain (4 cases), oral edema (4 cases), depersonalization (3 cases), peptic ulcer (3 cases), peripheral ischemia
(3 cases), and weight increase (3 cases), (Table 2). Additionally, 19 signals not listed on the current labels in South
Korea were compared to the labels from 4 other countries
(the USA, UK, EU, and Japan). Six of the above 19 signals
(neuritis, axillary pain, cerebral hemorrhage, facial edema,
pain anxiety, and back pain) were listed on the U.S. Food
and Drug Administration HPV vaccine labels and none were
listed on the labels in the UK and 1 signal (hypotension) was
listed on the labels in the EU and Japan (Table 2 and Supplementary Table 2).

Discussion
This study describes signal detection after HPV vaccination
based on KEARS data between January 2005 and December 2016. In this study, approximately 51.6% of AEs were
reported in the 9–27 years-olds group. Such result appears
to be associated with the HPV vaccine campaign targeting
women between the ages of 9 and 27 years who have had no
sexual experiences. In addition, consumer AE reporting for
all other vaccine groups is approximately 2.6%, while that
for HPV vaccine group is approximately 20%. High percentage of consumer spontaneous reporting is correlated with the
type of medical institutions where vaccination takes place.

As vaccines are usually administered at primary and secondary hospitals and clinics rather than tertiary hospitals,
it is assumed that spontaneous AE reports have been more
frequently made by consumers.
The major finding of this study was the detection of 13
signals that are not listed on the drug label in South Korea,
the USA, UK, EU, and Japan, such as neuralgia, tremor,
depersonalization, personality disorder, increased salivation, peptic ulcer, circulatory failure, peripheral ischemia,
micturition disorder, ovarian cyst, weight increase, and oral
edema. Our study also showed that the AE information presented on the current HPV vaccine labels in South Korea,
the USA, UK, EU, and Japan was inconsistent. AE information is initially reported during clinical trials and is updated
by pharmacovigilance studies and real-world data; therefore,
the information on the drug label may vary between countries and over time [35]. In this regard, numerous studies
have been conducted to compare safety information from
different countries. Shimazawa and Ikeda [36] conducted
a cross-sectional study using 189 new molecular materials
approved in the USA, UK, and Japan and found inconsistencies in the safety information in drug labeling across countries. Lee and Shin [37] compared label information for 50
cardiovascular drugs in 4 countries, including South Korea,
the USA, UK, and Japan, and found that label information in
pregnancy varies greatly. Jeong et al. [35] also showed that
the label information regarding drug interactions in drug
labels was inconsistent for 38 drugs in the USA, UK, China,
Japan and South Korea. Different regulations and guidance
regarding drug labeling in various countries explain some of
this inconsistent information. In South Korea, safety information is reported to KEARS, but labeling updates are not
required by law, and thus the latest safety communications
and warnings may not be included on the product label [35].
Neuritis is listed on the USA label, but not on the labels in
South Korea, the UK, EU, and Japan. Sridhar et al. reported
that patients with a history of autoimmune disease have a
higher incidence of optic neuritis, and Chang et al. estimated
that the association between the production of neuromyelitis
optica antibody and HPV vaccination was related to recurrent optic neuritis [38, 39]. In cardiovascular groups, 11
cases of circulatory failure and 12 cases of hypotension were
reported. A MedAlerts search of the US vaccine adverse
event reporting system databased in March 2018 revealed
74 cases of orthostatic hypotension and 391 cases of low
blood pressure incidents in patients administered the HPV
vaccine [40]. In this study, 23 cases of cardiovascular disorder including hypotension and circulatory failure were also
reported. However, circulatory failure is not listed on the
label of all studied countries and hypotension is on the label
of only the EU and Japan. The exact mechanism of circulatory failure and hypotension caused by the HPV vaccine
are unclear, and the causal relationship of these AEs and

13

International Journal of Clinical Pharmacy (2019) 41:1365–1372

HPV vaccination has not been determined, but a variety of
studies are underway to determine the common items and
mechanisms of each AE. Furthermore, cerebral hemorrhage
is an AE that has recently become a social issue along with
“paraplegia and death cases” [41–43] and negatively impacts
the vaccination rate. However, this AE is also not listed on
the labels from all studied countries except for the USA.
The current major controversies regarding HPV vaccine
safety involve autoimmune diseases [44]. A large cohort
study of more than 2 million young girls in France revealed
an increased risk of Guillain–Barre syndrome (GBS) following HPV 2 and 4 vaccination (adjusted hazard ratio: 3.78
[1.79–7.98]) and no increase in the risk of several autoimmune disease other than GBS [45]. In contrast, several other
studies reported no increased risk of GBS following HPV
vaccination. Grimaldi-Bensouda et al. [46] conducted a
large case control study to assess the risk of autoimmune
disorders following HPV 4 vaccination of young French
female subjects and found no increased risk of all autoimmune diseases (idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, central demyelination, connective tissue disorders, GBS, type
1 diabetes mellitus, and autoimmune thyroiditis). Andrews
et al. [47] conduced a self-controlled case-series study of
females in England administered the HPV 2 and 4 vaccines.
In 101 cases, the relative incidence (RI) of GBS at 3, 6,
and 12 months were 1.04 [0.47–2.28], 0.83 [0.41–1.69], and
1.10 [0.57–2.14], respectively, indicating that HPV vaccination did not increase the risk of GBS [47]. Geier et al.
[48] also conducted a case–control study to assess the risk
correlation between HPV 4 vaccines and serious autoimmune adverse events and found that the risk of GBS was
not high compared to in the control group (odds ratio 0.839
[0.601–1.145]).
This study has a few strengths. First, we used a large
spontaneous AE reporting database, which contains the data
of nearly 1.2 million patients which has been collected for
over 10 years. Second, by comparing current drug labels
between South Korea and the USA, UK, EU, and Japan, we
identified signals not listed on the labels of all studied countries and observed some differences between them.
This study also had some limitations. First, the KAERS
database is a passive spontaneous adverse event reporting system. The frequency and impact of a given ADR is
underestimated in this system, and thus the sensitivity for
detecting ADRs may be decreased by underreporting [49,
50]. Second, because of the characteristics of spontaneous
reporting, this study may provide limited information or
partial information on the cases. This may have influenced
our analysis. Additionally, some patient information, drug
information, and AEs, among other factors, were missing,
making it difficult to confirm the causality of AEs with
HPV vaccination. Third, the signal results of data-mining
(PRR, ROR, IC) do not support that HPV vaccine causes an

International Journal of Clinical Pharmacy (2019) 41:1365–1372

increased risk of AEs or new safety concerns, and thus this
study is insufficient to confirm whether the detected signal
is causally related to HPV vaccination. Therefore, further
studies should be conducted to assess the causal relationship
between HPV vaccine and signals.
Although we did not conduct causality assessment, early
detection of signals is meaningful for securing public health
and providing up-to-date information on drug safety.

Conclusion
In this study signals were identified that had not been previously reported in South Korea, but some of these signals
(e.g., neuritis, hypotension, circulatory failure, and cerebral
hemorrhage) are already listed on the drug labels in other
countries. South Korea should have a system that can update
the label more proactively, and global harmonization of label
information is needed for healthcare professions and consumers. The current study suggests further research directions such as expanding vaccination labels, greater pharmacovigilance, and identifying the causality of AEs associated
with HPV vaccination. Additionally, this information may
help health professionals provide better care to patients
based on the scientific data.
