The recent emergence of multidrug-resistant pathogens and/or pharmacokinetics-pharmacodynamics
considerations may result in off-label use of a certain class of antibacterials, including tigecycline. This study
was performed to clarify the safety proﬁle of tigecycline in the user-derived manner and to compare it with
the prescribing information provided by the manufacturer. Numerous spontaneous adverse event reports
(AERs) submitted to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) were analyzed after a revision of arbitrary drug names and the deletion of duplicated submissions. Standardized ofﬁcial pharmacovigilance tools
were used for quantitative detection of signals, i.e., drug-associated adverse events, including the proportional reporting ratio, the reporting odds ratio, the information component given by a Bayesian conﬁdence
propagation neural network, and the empirical Bayes geometric mean. Based on 22017956 co-occurrences,
i.e., drug-adverse event pairs, found in 1644220 AERs from 2004 to 2009, 248 adverse events were suggested
as tigecycline-associated ones. Adverse events with a relatively high frequency included nausea, vomiting,
pancreatitis, hepatic failure, hypoglycemia, and increase in levels of alanine aminotransferase, bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, aspartate aminotransferase, and gamma-glutamyltransferase. It is noted that cholestasis,
jaundice, an increase in International Normalized Ratio, and Stevens–Johnson syndrome were also, although
they were infrequent. The adverse events suggested were in agreement with information provided by the
manufacturer, suggesting that off-label use hardly results in unexpected adverse events, presumably due to
usage with extreme caution.

Tigecycline (Tygacil, Pﬁzer), a glycylcycline-class antibacterial, was developed in 2005 in the U.S.A., and its indications
include: 1) complicated skin and skin structure infections; 2)
complicated intra-abdominal infections; and 3) communityacquired bacterial pneumonia.1,2) With the emergence of multidrug-resistant Gram-negative pathogens,3–5) tigecycline has
attracted attention due to its in vitro activity against them.5–7)
Tigecycline is not yet approved for treating infections with
Acinetobacter baumannii and/or ventilator-associated pneumonia, and the experts have warned that its off-label use is
increasing globally.8–10)
Prescribing information provided by the manufacturer
suggests that this new drug is well-tolerated with mild-tomoderate gastrointestinal adverse events, including nausea,
vomiting, and diarrhea.11) However, extensive off-label use
may affect the safety proﬁle of tigecycline. Additionally, pharmacokinetics-pharmacodynamics considerations, i.e., comparisons between the usual minimum inhibitory concentration
for pathogens and plasma concentration after intravenous infusion, strongly suggest the need for dose escalation.1,9,12) This
may also accelerate the off-label use of tigecycline.
The present study was performed to clarify the safety proﬁle of tigecycline in a user-derived manner and to compare it
with the information provided by the manufacturer. Data on
adverse event reports (AERs) submitted to the U.S. Food and
Drug Administration (FDA) were reveiwed. This database relies on reports of spontaneous adverse events submitted to the
FDA generated by health professionals, consumers, and manufacturers; the system is referred to as the Adverse Event Reporting System (AERS). A statistically signiﬁcant association

with an adverse event was detected as a signal by applying
standardized ofﬁcial pharmacovigilance methods,13–19) where a
signal means a drug-associated adverse event.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Data Sources Input data for this study were taken from
the public release of the FDA’s AERS database, which covers
the period from the ﬁrst quarter of 2004 through the end of
2009. The data structure of the AERS is in compliance with
international safety reporting guidance ICH E2B, consisting
of 7 data sets: patient demographic and administrative information (ﬁle descriptor: DEMO); drug/biologic information
(DRUG); adverse events (REAC); patient outcomes (OUTC);
report sources (RPSR); drug therapy start and end dates
(THER); and indications for use/diagnosis (INDI).20) The
outline of 7 data sets is shown in Fig. 1. In the ASCII format,
ﬁle names have the format ‹ﬁle descriptor›yyQq, where “yy”
is a 2-digit identiﬁer for the year, and “q” is a 1-digit identiﬁer for the quarter. All ASCII data ﬁles are linked using ISR,
a unique number for identifying an AER. Three of 7 ﬁles are
linked using DRUG_SEQ, a unique number for identifying a
drug for an ISR. The adverse events in REAC are coded using
preferred terms (PTs) in the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) terminology. MedDRA ver. 13.0
was used in this study.
Prior to analysis, all drug names were uniﬁed into generic
names by a text-mining approach, because AERS permits the
registering of arbitrary drug names, including trade names
and abbreviations. Spelling errors were detected by GNU

the IC025 metric, a criterion indicating the lower limit of the
95% two-sided conﬁdence interval of the IC, and a signal is
detected when the IC025 value exceeds 0.15) Finally, with the
EB05 metric, a lower one-sided 95% conﬁdence limit of the
EBGM16) is used, and a signal is detected when the EB05 is
greater than or equal to the threshold value 2. In this study,
adverse events were extracted when at least 1 of 4 indices met
the criteria indicated above.

Data Structure of AERS

The data consists of 7 subsets: patient demographic and administrative information (ﬁle descriptor: DEMO); drug/biologic information (DRUG); adverse events
(REAC); patient outcomes (OUTC); report sources (RPSR); drug therapy start and
end dates (THER); and indications for use/diagnosis (INDI).20) In the ASCII format, ﬁle names have the format ‹ﬁle descriptor›yyQq, where “yy” is a 2-digit identiﬁer for the year, and “q” is a 1-digit identiﬁer for the quarter. The data ﬁles are
linked using ISR, a unique number for identifying an adverse event report (AER),
or DRUG_SEQ, a unique number for identifying a drug for an ISR.

Aspell and carefully conﬁrmed by working pharmacists.
Foods, beverages, treatments (e.g., X-ray radiation), and unspeciﬁed names (e.g., beta-blockers) were omitted for this
study. Duplicated reports were deleted according to the FDA’s
recommendation of adopting the most recent CASE number, resulting in the reduction of the number of AERs from
2231029 to 1644220. The total number of co-occurrences, i.e.,
drug-adverse event pairs, in the 1644220 AERs was 22017956.
Data Mining In pharmacovigilance analyses, data mining
algorithms have been developed to identify drug-associated
adverse events as signals that are reported more frequently
than expected by estimating expected reporting frequencies
on the basis of information on all drugs and all events in a
database.17–19) For example, the proportional reporting ratio
(PRR),13) the reporting odds ratio (ROR),14) the information
component (IC),15) and the empirical Bayes geometric mean
(EBGM)16) are widely used, and indeed, the PRR is currently
used by the U.K. Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency, the ROR by the Netherlands Pharmacovigilance
Centre, the IC by the World Health Organization, and the
EBGM by the FDA.
All of these algorithms extract decision rules for signal detection and/or calculate scores to measure the associations between drugs and adverse events from a two-by-two frequency
table of counts that involve the presence or absence of a particular drug and a particular event occurring in case reports.
These algorithms, however, differ from one another in that
the PRR and ROR are frequentist (non-Bayesian), whereas the
IC and EBGM are Bayesian. In this section, only the scoring
thresholds used in the present study are given, and the reader
is referred to review articles for more extensive details of each
statistical test.17–19)
Here, we deﬁne how a drug and associated adverse event
is classiﬁed as a signal when using each statistical test. Using
the PRR, a signal is detected if the count of co-occurrences
is 3 or more, and the PRR is 2 or more with an associated χ2
value of 4 or more.13) For the ROR, a signal is detected if the
lower limit of the 95% two-sided conﬁdence interval of the
ROR exceeds 1.14) Signal detection using the IC is done using

The total number of co-occurrences with tigecycline was
1906. In total, 248 adverse events were suggested as tigecycline-associated ones with 1182 co-occurrences. Tigecyclineassociated adverse events are listed in Table 1, and those with
relatively high frequency included nausea (PT10028813), vomiting (PT10047700), an increase in the alanine aminotransferase level (PT10001551), pancreatitis (PT10033645), an increase
in the blood bilirubin level (PT10005364), an increase in
the blood alkaline phosphatase level (PT10059570), an increase in the aspartate aminotransferase level (PT10003481),
hepatic failure (PT10019663), an increase in the gammaglutamyltransferase level (PT10017693), and hypoglycemia
(PT10020993). Albeit infrequent, cholestasis (PT10008635),
jaundice (PT10023126), an increase in the International Normalized Ratio (PT10022595), and Stevens–Johnson syndrome
(PT10042033) were also extracted (not shown in Table 1).

DISCUSSION
In this study, 248 adverse events were suggested as tigecycline-associated ones. Although experts have warned that offlabel use of tigecycline is increasing globally,8–10) the adverse
events suggested here were in agreement with the prescribing
information provided by the manufacturer,11) suggesting that
off-label use hardly results in unexpected adverse events, presumably due to usage with extreme caution.
The AERS database is considered a valuable tool; however,
some limitations inherent to spontaneous reporting have been
pointed out.17) First, the data occasionally contain misspellings
and miswording, although the structure of AERS is in compliance with international safety reporting guidance. Second,
the system was started more than 10 years ago, and reporting
patterns have changed over time. Third, the adverse events
are coded using hierarchical terms of PTs in MedDRA, and
changes in terminology over time may also affect the quality
of the database. Finally, there are a number of duplicate entries in the database. To overcome problems with data quality,
we manually corrected mistakes in the data entities and deleted duplicates according to the FDA’s recommended method.
Previously, the AERS was used to conﬁrm the adverse
events accompanying the administration of platinum agents.21)
The data obtained were consistent with clinical observations, suggesting the usefulness of the system.21) Additionally,
this system was applied to evaluate the susceptibility of 14
anticancer agents to hypersensitivity reactions, and it was
found that the number of co-occurrences was an important
factor in signal detection.22,23) Very recently, this system has
been applied to evaluate muscular and renal adverse events
induced by statins,24) and adverse events associated with
capecitabine.25) The reproducibility of clinical observations

was again conﬁrmed, providing that the number of co-occurrences was sufﬁciently large to detect a signal.
It is noted that Stevens–Johnson syndrome was suggested
as a tigecycline-associated adverse event. This adverse event
was only added to the prescribing information published in
January 2011. However, the AERS database from 2004 to

2009 was used in the present study, suggesting that this system may contribute to the early detection of association with
a speciﬁc adverse event. Providing that this database is useful
in terms of the reproducibility of clinical observations, etc.,
the prescribing information could be revised based on information in this database. On the other hand, another concern

970

Vol. 35, No. 6

arose about the use of the AERS database: the analysis cannot exclude the adverse events other than the drug-associated
ones. For example, death, multiple-organ failure, sepsis, renal
failure, and respiratory failure listed in Table 1 were expected
to be due to infection rather than to tigecycline. Thus, there is
an urgent need to establish a ﬁltering method to extract drugassociated adverse events from all adverse events extracted.
