Abstract
Purpose: Voltage-gated sodium channels (VGSCs) are drug targets for the treatment of epilepsy.
Recently, a decreased risk of cancer associated with sodium channel-blocking antiepileptic drugs
(AEDs) has become a research focus of interest. The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that the use of sodium channel-blocking AEDs are inversely associated with cancer, using
different methodologies, algorithms, and databases.
Methods: A total of 65,146,507 drug-reaction pairs from the first quarter of 2004 through the end
of 2013 were downloaded from the US Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting
System. The reporting odds ratio (ROR) and information component (IC) were used to detect an
inverse association between AEDs and cancer. Upper limits of the 95% confidence interval (CI) of
< 1 and < 0 for the ROR and IC, respectively, signified inverse associations. Furthermore, using a
claims database, which contains 3 million insured persons, an event sequence symmetry analysis
(ESSA) was performed to identify an inverse association between AEDs and cancer over the period of January 2005 to May 2014. The upper limit of the 95% CI of adjusted sequence ratio (ASR)
< 1 signified an inverse association.
Results: In the FAERS database analyses, significant inverse associations were found between
sodium channel-blocking AEDs and individual cancers. In the claims database analyses, sodium
channel-blocking AED use was inversely associated with diagnoses of colorectal cancer, lung
cancer, gastric cancer, and hematological malignancies, with ASRs of 0.72 (95% CI: 0.60 – 0.86),
0.65 (0.51 – 0.81), 0.80 (0.65 – 0.98), and 0.50 (0.37 – 0.66), respectively. Positive associations
between sodium channel-blocking AEDs and cancer were not found in the study.
Conclusion: Multi-methodological approaches using different methodologies, algorithms, and
databases suggest that sodium channel-blocking AED use is inversely associated with colorectal
cancer, lung cancer, gastric cancer, and hematological malignancies.
Key words: Voltage-gated sodium channels

Introduction
Voltage-gated sodium channels (VGSCs) are
drug targets for the treatment of epilepsy [1]. Recently, the expression of VGSCs has been identified in a
number of major cancers [2, 3], and many studies have
indicated that VGSCs promote in vitro cellular behaviors associated with metastasis, including migration and invasion [4-9]. VGSCs are up-regulated in

human metastatic disease, and VGSC activity potentiates metastatic cell behavior [6, 10, 11]. Therefore,
blockage of these channels may be effective for
treatment of cancer. Cancer is a leading cause of death
worldwide, and metastasis is a major concern with
cancer treatment, as metastatic cancer is rarely responsive to treatment. Inhibition of tumor growth and

metastasis is the most practical goal for those patients
who are unable to tolerate radical surgery or are
deemed unsuitable for surgery. Therefore, better
strategies for prevention of metastasis are desired. In
recent years, the focus has been on the role of ion
channels in the development and progression of cancer. A few mechanisms have been suggested for the
role of VGSCs in migration and invasion of cancer
cells. The effects of VGSCs have been associated with
regulation of pH, gene expression and intracellular
calcium levels [5, 12, 13]. However, the mechanism(s)
regulating functional VGSC expression in cancer cells
remains unknown.
Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) including phenytoin,
carbamazepine, lamotrigine, topiramate, valproic acid, and ethotoin are representative sodium channel-blocking drugs. Therefore, use of AEDs is expected to delay the development of metastasis and
thus prolong survival in patients with cancer. However, the relationship between sodium channel-blocking AEDs and survival of cancer patients has
remains unclear. Recently, a cohort study using a
medical database comprising 100,000 patients diagnosed with breast, colorectal or prostate cancer was
designed to test the hypothesis that sodium channel-blocking drugs delay the development of metastasis and thus prolong survival of cancer patients [14].
However, at present, no definitive evidence exists to
support this hypothesis.
In recent years, data mining utilizing different
methodologies, algorithms, and databases has been
used to identify risk signals within medical databases,
including spontaneous adverse drug reaction databases, claim databases, and prescription databases.
We applied these methodologies and algorithms to
the detection of inverse signals of cancer associated
with sodium channel-blocking AED use.

Methods
Data from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Adverse Event Reporting System
(FAERS)
The FAERS is a computerized information database designed to support the FDA’s post-marketing
safety surveillance program for all approved drugs
and therapeutic biological products. The system contains all reports of adverse events reported spontaneously by health care professionals, manufacturers,
and consumers worldwide. The FAERS consists of
seven datasets that include patient demographic and
administrative information (file descriptor DEMO),
drug and biological information (DRUG), adverse
events (REAC), patient outcomes (OUTC), report
sources (RPSR), start of drug therapy and end dates

49
(THER), and indications for use/diagnosis (INDI).
Unique identification numbers for each FAERS report
allow linkage of all information from different files.
The raw data from the FAERS database can be
downloaded freely from the FDA website
(http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/InformationOnDrugs/
ucm135151.htm).
The present study included FAERS data from the
first quarter of 2004 through the end of 2013. A total of
4,866,160 reports were obtained. Reports with a
common case number were identified as duplicate
reports and were excluded from the analyses. Finally,
a total of 65,146,507 drug-reaction pairs were identified among 4,081,582 reports. The preferred terms
(PTs) of the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA® version 17.0) were used to classify
adverse events.

Identifying AEDs and cancers
The FAERS permits the registration of arbitrary
drug names including trade and generic names and
abbreviations. All drug names were extracted from
the DRUG file of the FAERS and recorded. An archive
of drug names that included the names of all preparations, generic names, and synonyms of drugs marketed worldwide was created using the Martindale
website
(https://www.medicinescomplete.com/mc/login.ht
m). Phenytoin, carbamazepine, lamotrigine, topiramate, valproic acid, and ethotoin were identified by
linking this archive with the FAERS database. All
records that included AEDs in the DRUG files were
selected, and the relevant reactions from the
REACTION files were then identified.
Adverse events in the FAERS database were
coded using the MedDRA® PTs, which are grouped
by defined medical condition or area of interest. We
identified PTs related to cancer using the Standardized MedDRA® Queries (SMQ). PTs related to 10
cancers (bladder cancer, colorectal cancer, lung cancer, pancreatic cancer, gastric cancer, esophageal
cancer, hematological malignancies, melanoma, breast
cancer, and prostate cancer) were identified in the
SMQ category of malignant tumors.

Data mining (disproportionality analysis)
The reporting odds ratio (ROR) and information
component (IC) were utilized to detect spontaneous
report signals. Signal scores were calculated using a
case/non-case method [15, 16]. ROR and IC are
widely used algorithms that have been employed by
the Netherlands Pharmacovigilance Centre and the
World Health Organization, respectively [17, 18].
Those reports containing the event of interest were

http://www.medsci.org

Int. J. Med. Sci. 2016, Vol. 13
defined as the cases; all other reports comprised the
non-cases.
Applying these algorithms and using a
two-by-two table of frequency counts, we calculated
signal scores to assess whether or not a drug was significantly associated with cancer diagnosis. However,
these calculations or algorithms, so-called disproportionality analyses, differ from one another in that the
ROR is frequentist (non-Bayesian)[17], whereas the IC
is Bayesian[18]. For the ROR, an inverse signal was
defined if the upper limit of the 95% two-sided confidence interval (95% CI) was < 1. For the IC, an inverse signal was defined if the upper limit of the 95%
CI was < 0. In the current study, two methods were
used to detect inverse signals, and the association
between AED and cancer was listed as an inverse
signal when the two indices met the criteria outlined
above. Data management and analyses were performed using Visual Mining Studio software (version
8.0; Mathematical Systems, Inc. Tokyo, Japan).

Claims data
Data source
A large and chronologically organized claims
database constructed by the Japan Medical Data
Center Co., Ltd (JMDC; Tokyo, Japan), using standardized disease classifications and anonymous record
linkage, was employed in this study [19]. In total, this
database includes approximately 3 million insured
persons (approximately 2.5% of the population),
comprised mainly of company employees and their
family members. The JMDC claims database includes
monthly claims from medical institutions and pharmacies submitted from January 2005 to May 2014. The
database provides information on the beneficiaries,
including encrypted personal identifiers, age, sex,
International Classification of Diseases 10th revision
(ICD-10) procedure and diagnostic codes, as well as
the name, dose, and number of days supplied of the
prescribed and/or dispensed drugs. All drugs were
coded according to the Anatomical Therapeutic
Chemical classification of the European Pharmaceutical Market Research Association. An encrypted
personal identifier was used to link claims data from
different hospitals, clinics, and pharmacies. For the
event sequence symmetry analysis (ESSA), we utilized cases extracted from the JMDC claims database
for whom sodium channel-blocking AEDs were prescribed at least once during the study period and for
whom a diagnosis of cancer was made.
This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Kinki University School of Pharmacy. All
personal data (name and identification number) from
the JMDC claims database were replaced by a univocal numerical code, rendering the database anony-

50
mous at the source. Therefore, there was no need to
obtain informed consent in this study.

Definition of AEDs and cancers
Six sodium channel-blocking AEDs (phenytoin,
carbamazepine, lamotorigine, topiramate, valproic
acid, and ethotoin) were analyzed. The ICD-10 codes
of C18 (malignant neoplasm of colon), C19 (malignant
neoplasm of rectosigmoid junction) and C20 (malignant neoplasm of rectum) were selected as those defining colorectal cancer. In addition, the ICD-10 codes
of C67 (malignant neoplasm of bladder), C34 (malignant neoplasm of bronchus and lung), C25 (malignant
neoplasm of pancreas), C16 (malignant neoplasm of
stomach), C15 (malignant neoplasm of esophagus),
C81-96 (malignant neoplasms, stated or presumed to
be primary, of lymphoid, hematopoietic and related
tissue), C43 (malignant melanoma of skin), C50 (malignant neoplasm of breast), and C61 (malignant neoplasm of prostate) were selected as those defining
bladder cancer, lung cancer, pancreatic cancer, gastric
cancer, esophageal cancer, hematological malignancies, melanoma, breast cancer, and prostate cancer,
respectively.

Data mining (symmetry analysis)
ESSA was performed to evaluate whether sodium channel-blocking AEDs decrease the risk of
cancer. The ESSA method has been described in detail
in several published studies investigating the associations between the use of certain targeted drugs and
potential adverse events [20, 21]. Briefly, the ESSA
evaluates asymmetry in the distribution of an incident
event before and after the initiation of a specific
treatment. Asymmetry may indicate an association
between the specific treatment of interest and the
event. In this study, the inverse association between
sodium channel-blocking AED use and the diagnosis
of cancer was analyzed.
The crude sequence ratio (SR) is defined as the
ratio of the number of patients newly diagnosed with
cancer after relative to before the initiation of sodium
channel-blocking AEDs. ASR < 1 signified an inverse
association of sodium channel-blocking AED use with
a risk of cancer. The SR is sensitive to prescribing or
event trends over time. Therefore, the SRs were adjusted for temporal trends in sodium channel-blocking AEDs and events, using the method
proposed by Hallas [20]. The probability that sodium
channel-blocking AEDs were prescribed first, in the
absence of any causal relationship, can be estimated
by a so-called null-effect SR [20]. The null-effect SR
generated by the proposed model may be interpreted
as a reference value for the SR. Therefore, the
null-effect SR is the expected SR in the absence of any
http://www.medsci.org

Int. J. Med. Sci. 2016, Vol. 13

51

causal association, after accounting for incidence
trends. By dividing the crude SR by the null-effect SR,
an adjusted SR (ASR) corrected for temporal trends is
obtained. A slightly modified model was used to account for the limited time interval allowed between
sodium channel-blocking AED use and cancer diagnosis [21].
All incident users of sodium channel-blocking
AEDs and all newly diagnosed cancer cases were
identified from January 2005 to May 2014. Those patients were followed up until May 2014; therefore,
different patients were followed-up over different
periods. Incidence was defined as the first prescription of sodium channel-blocking AEDs. To exclude
prevalent users of sodium channel-blocking AEDs,
the analysis was restricted to users whose first prescription was administered in July 2005 or later (after
a run-in period of 6 months). Likewise, the analysis
was restricted to cases whose first diagnosis was in
July 2005 or later. To ensure that our analysis was
restricted to incident users of sodium channel-blocking AEDs and cases newly diagnosed with
cancer, we also performed a waiting time distribution
analysis [22]. An identical run-in period was also applied to patients enrolled in the cohort after June 2005.
Incident users were identified by excluding those patients who received their first prescription for sodium
channel-blocking AEDs before July 2005, and cases
newly diagnosed with cancer were identified by excluding those patients whose first diagnosis of cancer
was before July 2005. Those patients who had initiated
a new treatment with sodium channel-blocking AEDs
and whose first diagnosis of cancer was within a
36-month period of treatment initiation were identified. Patients who had received their first prescription
for sodium channel-blocking AEDs and whose first
diagnosis of cancer was within the same month were
not included in determination of the SR.
The results of the analyses are expressed as
means ± standard deviations (SD) for quantitative
data and as frequencies (percentages) for categorical
data. The 95% CI for the ASR was calculated using a
method for exact CIs for binomial distributions [23].

Results
FAERS database
A total of 5,174 PTs were found in reports on
phenytoin, 6,353 for carbamazepine, 5,908 for
lamotrigine, 5,544 for topiramate, 6,625 for valproic
acid, and 79 for ethotoin. The total number of
drug-reaction pairs for sodium channel-blocking
AEDs was 694,785, including 98,049 for phenytoin,
126,868 for carbamazepine, 170,433 for lamotrigine,
112,454 for topiramate, 186,889 for valproic acid, and
92 for ethotoin. The number of drug-reaction pairs
was 17,495 for bladder cancer, 32,240 for colorectal
cancer, 75,759 for lung cancer, 20,801 for pancreatic
cancer, 10,207 for gastric cancer, 5,792 for esophageal
cancer, 147,183 for hematological malignancies, 15,447
for melanoma, 165,170 for breast cancer, and 27,026
for prostate cancer.
The statistical data on sodium channel-blocking
AED-associated cancers are presented in Table 1. The
signal scores of individual cancers showed an inverse
association with sodium channel-blocking AEDs
(Figure 1). In the analysis of individual sodium
channel-blocking AEDs, significant inverse signals
were found for bladder cancer with phenytoin, carbamazepine, lamotrigine, topiramate, and valproic
acid, for colorectal cancer with carbamazepine,
lamotrigine, topiramate, and valproic acid, for lung
cancer with phenytoin, carbamazepine, lamotrigine,
topiramate, and valproic acid, for pancreatic cancer
with phenytoin, carbamazepine, lamotrigine, topiramate, and valproic acid, for gastric cancer with
phenytoin, lamotrigine, topiramate, and valproic acid,
for esophageal cancer with lamotrigine, for hematological malignancies with phenytoin, carbamazepine,
lamotrigine, topiramate, and valproic acid, for melanoma with phenytoin, carbamazepine, lamotrigine,
topiramate, and valproic acid, for breast cancer with
phenytoin, carbamazepine, lamotrigine, topiramate,
and valproic acid, and for prostate cancer with carbamazepine, lamotrigine, topiramate, and valproic
acid. No significant positive associations were found
in this analysis.

JMDC claims database
The ESSA characteristics of the study population
are summarized in Table 2. The number of claims
pertaining to sodium channel-blocking AEDs during
the study period was 729,441. Among 34,473 sodium
channel-blocking AED users, 17,610 incident users
were identified, the mean age of whom was 35.1 ± 16.7
years. Table 3 shows the associations between sodium

channel-blocking AED use and the risk of cancers. Of
the 17,610 incident sodium channel-blocking AED
users, there were 158 with a diagnosis of bladder
cancer, 647 with colorectal cancer, 408 with lung cancer, 265 with pancreatic cancer, 487 with gastric cancer, 40 with esophageal cancer, 299 with hematological malignancies, and 20 with melanoma. Of the 9,120
female and 8,490 male incident sodium channel-blocking AED users, 262 and 146 had a diagnosis
of breast cancer and prostate cancer, respectively,
before or after the initiation of sodium channel-blocking AEDs. Sodium channel-blocking AED
use was inversely associated with diagnoses of colorectal cancer, lung cancer, gastric cancer, and hematological malignancies, with ASRs of 0.72 (95% CI:
0.60 – 0.86), 0.65 (0.51 – 0.81), 0.80 (0.65 – 0.98), and
0.50 (0.37 – 0.66), respectively (Figure 2). Analyses of
bladder cancer, pancreatic cancer, esophageal cancer,
melanoma, breast cancer, and prostate cancer diagnoses showed no significant inverse associations with
sodium channel-blocking AED use. In the analyses of
individual sodium channel-blocking AEDs, phenytoin
was inversely associated with diagnoses of colorectal
cancer (ASR: 0.53, 95% CI: 0.33 – 0.83), lung cancer

(0.30, 0.17 – 0.50), gastric cancer (0.49, 0.29 – 0.83),
hematological malignancies (0.25, 0.13 – 0.47), and
breast cancer (0.35, 0.12 – 0.86). Carbamazepine was
inversely associated with a diagnosis of colorectal
cancer (0.74, 0.56 – 0.97). Valproic acid was inversely
associated with diagnoses of colorectal cancer (0.63,
0.49 – 0.81), lung cancer (0.60, 0.44 – 0.82), and hematological malignancies (0.45, 0.30 – 0.66). No signifi-

cant inverse associations were found in the analyses
of lamotrigine, topiramate, and ethotoin. No
significant positive associations were found in this analysis.
A summary of the inverse signals detected for
sodium channel-blocking AED-associated cancers is
presented in Table 4.

Discussion
In analyses of both the FAERS and JMDC claims
databases, significant inverse signals for colorectal
cancer, lung cancer, gastric cancer, and hematological
malignancies were found for sodium channel-blocking AEDs as a class. Consistent findings
from the independent analyses involving different
methodologies, algorithms, and databases suggest
that sodium channel-blocking AED use is inversely
associated with the risks of these cancers. For bladder
cancer, pancreatic cancer, esophageal cancer, melanoma, breast cancer, and prostate cancer, significant
inverse associations with sodium channel-blocking
AEDs as a class were found in the analysis of the
FAERS database, but not the JMDC claims database.
Therefore, we determined that sodium channel-blocking AEDs as a class have no inverse association with these cancers.
In the analyses of individual sodium channel-blocking AEDs, significant inverse associations
were found for colorectal cancer with both carbamazepine and valproic acid, for lung cancer with both
phenytoin and valproic acid, for gastric cancer with
phenytoin, for hematological malignancies with both
phenytoin and valproic acid, and for breast cancer
with phenytoin. Of note, significant positive signals
between sodium channel-blocking AEDs and cancer
risk were not found in the analyses. Although there
has been no definite clinical evidence at the present
time, we have clearly showed an inverse association
between sodium channel-blocking AEDs and several
cancers by analyzing different databases using different methodologies. These consistent findings may
suggest that sodium channel-blocking AEDs are associated with decreased risk of certain cancers.
Yang et al. reported that phenytoin suppresses
Na+ currents in VGSC-expressing metastatic breast
cancer cells, thus blocking VGSC-dependent migration and invasion [13]. This experimental study has
suggested that phenytoin may have potential chemopreventative effects against breast cancer. Recently,

Nelson et al. reported that treatment with phenytoin
significantly reduced breast tumor growth and metastasis in vivo [24]. Although phenytoin is expected
to be a potential anticancer drug candidate, there is no
clinical evidence that phenytoin use is associated with
a decreased risk of cancer. In our study, a significant
inverse association between breast cancer and phenytoin was found in analyses of the FAERS and JMDC
claims databases. This accumulation of evidence, including our study, supports the hypothesis that
phenytoin use may be associated with a decreased
risk of breast cancer. Additionally, some studies have
suggested that phenytoin also inhibits migration and
secretion in prostate cancer cells [10, 25]. In our study,
an inverse association of phenytoin with prostate
cancer risk was not found, but associations with lung
cancer, gastric cancer, hematological malignancies,
and breast cancer were detected in analyses of the
FAERS and JMDC claims databases. These findings
support the hypothesis that phenytoin may be a possible anticancer drug candidate.
Significant inverse associations were found for
valproic acid with colorectal cancer, lung cancer, and
hematological malignancies in analyses of both the
FAERS and JMDC claims databases. Valproic acid is a
VGSC-targeting AED, but several experimental and
clinical studies have also been performed to evaluate
the anticancer effects of valproic acid as a histone
deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor. Histone acetylation
represents an epigenetic change and plays important
roles in the initiation and progression of cancer [26,
27]. Meanwhile, deacetylation of histones induces
transcriptional repression through chromatin condensation. HDACs play important roles in transcriptional regulation and pathogenesis of cancer and have
also been shown to downregulate angiogenesis-related gene expression in endothelial and tumor
cells [28, 29]. HDAC inhibitors induce differentiation,
cell growth arrest and apoptosis by promoting gene
transcription in different cancer cell types [30, 31].
Thus, HDAC inhibitors are considered to be potential
drug candidates for differentiation therapy of cancer.
http://www.medsci.org

Int. J. Med. Sci. 2016, Vol. 13
A number of in vivo and in vitro studies demonstrated that VPA is a strong HDAC inhibitor and is
effective for regulating the growth, differentiation,
and apoptosis of cancer cells as well as for blocking
angiogenesis [32-35]. To date, three HDAC inhibitors
(vorinostat, romidepsin, and belinostat) have been
approved by the FDA for the treatment of cutaneous
T-cell lymphoma [36]. Currently, these three drugs are
undergoing further evaluation in other diseases, including hematological malignancies and solid tumors,
either as a single agent or in combination with other
drugs [36].
Experimental and clinical investigations have
investigated VPA as a potential anticancer drug candidate [37-39]. In addition, clinical studies have been
designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of combination therapies involving VPA and anticancer
agents, including demethylating or hypomethylating
agents, in patients with advanced-stage cancers
[40-42]. Recently, a retrospective cohort study by
Kang et al. showed that use of VPA is associated with
a lower risk of developing head and neck cancer [43].
However, data from these studies are inadequate to
determine whether the use of VPA reduces the risk of
cancer. Although no definite clinical evidence exists at
the present time, our study supports the hypothesis
that valproic acid may be a potential anticancer drug
candidate.
Few studies have addressed the potential anticancer effect of VPA as a sodium channel-blocking
agent. However, the anticancer effects of VPA might
be attributable to the effects of both HDAC inhibitor
and sodium channel-blocking agent. Further studies
are needed to evaluate this.
To date, there have been no reports of an association between carbamazepine and cancer risk in humans. However, in our study, a significant inverse
association between carbamazepine and colorectal
cancer was found in analyses of the FAERS and JMDC
claims databases. This result suggested that carbamazepine may also be a potential anticancer drug candidate. Further study is required to confirm this
finding.
For lamotrigine and topiramate, significant inverse associations were found for several cancers only
in the analysis of the FAERS, but not the JMDC, database. To date, there has been no report regarding the
association between these AEDs and cancer risk. In
this study, the detection of significant inverse signals
from analyses of both databases was applied as a strict
criterion for defining significant associations. Consequently, associations between sodium channel-blocking AEDs and these cancers are unclear.
Further studies are required to evaluate whether these
AEDs reduce the risk of cancer.

57
Although the analysis of spontaneous reports is
a useful method for identifying signals, there are
several potential limitations that should be taken into
account when interpreting results obtained from
spontaneous reporting databases. First, there is no
certainty that the reported event was actually due to
the drug. Second, not every adverse event or medication error that occurs with a drug product is reported.
Third, the database is missing data and has frequent
misspellings of drug names. Fourth, no individual
algorithm is adequate to detect signals, and the concurrent use of other algorithms is essential. Therefore,
ROR and IC algorithms were used in the analysis of
the FAERS database, and the adverse events were
listed as drug-associated when the two indices met
the criteria in the current study. Furthermore, in the
current study, a different methodology, ESSA of the
JMDC claims database, was used to confirm the
findings of the FAERS database analyses. Of course,
the ESSA is associated with several potential limitations due to its application to a claims database. First,
our study population was selected from beneficiaries
covered by the employees’ health insurance system.
Because most beneficiaries are working adults or their
family members, the proportion of elderly patients
aged ≥65 years is low. Second, the diagnoses listed in
the claims were not validated. We generally needed to
consider the diagnosis contained in the claim, which
is listed for health insurance claims. However, it is
obvious that serious diseases such as cancer may not
be listed in the claim only for the purpose of health
insurance claims; that is, the patient is likely to actually have the disease. Third, individual cases were not
reviewed, and other causes were not considered. Potential confounding factors, including smoking history, health history, race/ethnicity, body mass index
and occupation, which are associated with cancer,
could not be controlled in this study. Lack of data on
these potential confounding factors should be considered as a limitation when interpreting our findings.
Mean age of antiepileptic drug users identified in the
study was younger compared to the common cancer
patients. Advanced age is the most important risk
factor for cancer. Therefore, study patients for ESSA
may be less likely to develop cancer. However, the
ESSA is based on within-subject comparisons, and
this method allows patients to serve as their own
comparator. Therefore, the ESSA is similar to the
case-crossover design, in which exposures during a
fixed period before the case date (date when the target
outcome occurred) and prior dates were compared in
the same individual. These within-subject comparisons can thus be fully controlled for potential confounding
between-subject
differences
and
time-invariant characteristics, including age, gender,

genetic factors, mental health status, and other unknown confounding factors [44, 45].
Although these potential limitations should be
taken into account when interpreting the results obtained from this study, it is noteworthy that the multi-methodological approaches used, comprising different algorithms and databases, detected significant
inverse associations between sodium channel-blocking AEDs and certain cancers. Disproportionality and symmetry analyses were originally developed to detect unknown adverse events for pharmacovigilance. We applied these methodologies and
algorithms to the detection of inverse signals of cancer
associated with sodium channel-blocking AED use,
and our study detected inverse associations between
sodium channel-blocking AED use and several cancers. If these inverse signals reveal unknown effects of
sodium channel-blocking AED, these methodologies
may be potential tools to detect unknown clinical effects. Further studies are required to validate or
evaluate the potential of these methodologies.

Conclusions
Multi-methodological approaches using different methodologies, algorithms, and databases suggest
that sodium channel-blocking AED use is inversely
associated with several cancers. Although a number
of experimental studies suggest that sodium channel-blocking AEDs are potential candidates for anti-cancer agents, no definitive evidence exists. The
present study demonstrated an inverse association
between sodium channel-blocking AED use and the
risk of certain cancers. Further epidemiological and
observational studies are required to confirm our
findings. In addition, further studies are required to
verify the hypothesis that multi-methodological approaches using different methodologies, algorithms,
and databases may be useful tools to explore unknown clinical effects of drugs.
