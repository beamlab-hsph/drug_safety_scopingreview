Backgrounds: Immune-related adverse events were reported in patients treated with immune checkpoint in­
hibitors (ICIs). However, with the increasing number of immune-related adverse events (irAEs), the differences of
each immune checkpoint inhibitor regimen had not been fully assessed.
Methods: Disproportionality analysis was used in data mining of the suspected adverse events after ICIs
administration based on the Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) from
January 2004 to December 2019. The onset time and fatality proportion of ICI-associated irAEs were further
evaluated.
Results: A total of 32,441 reports of ICI-associated irAEs were gathered. This study showed that all ICI regimens
generated lung toxicity and endocrine toxicity signals. Colitis, pneumonitis and interstitial lung disease were the
most common ICI-associated irAEs. Five regimens including durvalumab monotherapy, ipilimumab mono­
therapy, ipilimumab plus nivolumab, ipilimumab plus pembrolizumab, durvalumab plus tremelimumab were
associated with irAEs. Anti-PD-1 agents generated more signals of ocular toxicities than anti-PD-L1 agents, while
anti-PD-L1 agents reported more signals of hematologic toxicities. Anti-CTLA-4 agents showed more signals of
gastrointestinal toxicities compared with anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 agents. The highest fatality proportion of lung
toxicities with durvalumab monotherapy, hematological toxicities with avelumab monotherapy, renal and skin
toxicities with cemiplimab monotherapy were found.
Conclusion: Our results demonstrated that each ICI regimen had different characteristics of irAEs. Pembrolizumab
had the highest fatality proportion. Ipilimumab plus pembrolizumab had the shortest median time to onset irAEs.
Further studies were expected to assess whether there were clinically relevant differences exist among ICIs.

1. Introduction
Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) were a novel class of cancer
treatment drugs including cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4:
ipilimumab, tremelimumab), programmed cell death 1 (PD-1: nivolu­
mab, cemiplimab, pembrolizumab), and programmed cell death ligand
1 (PD-L1: atezolizumab, avelumab, durvalumab) [1]. By removing the
inhibitory effect and releasing the restrained anti-tumor immune
response [2], ICIs had shown significant efficacy and changed the
therapeutic landscape of a variety of solid tumors including non-small
cell lung cancer (NSCLC) [3], hepatocellular carcinoma [4], renal cell
cancer [5], urothelial carcinoma [6], and others. Beside impressive

clinical effects, a unique spectrum of side effects referred to as immunerelated adverse events (irAEs) was reported [7]. It had been found that
anti-PD-1/PD-L1 and anti-CTLA-4 had differences in terms of types,
rates, time to onset and severity of irAEs [8]. For example, ICI-associated
colitis occurred earliest in ipilimumab among all monotherapies [9].
With the rapid expansion of oncology indications of ICIs, clinicians were
increasingly facing more complex and rarer irAEs. In line with the
mechanism of action mediated by the immune system, irAEs resembled
classic autoimmune disease and involved any organ system [10].
Frequently reported irAEs involved lung, liver, skin and gut [11].
Common irAEs could be found in pre-market clinical trials of ICIs, but it
was difficult to evaluate profiles of irAEs and obtain accurate data on

incidence or prevalence, due to strictly diagnosis standards, selection
criteria, relatively small sample sizes and limited duration of follow-ups
[12]. Hence, post-marketing monitoring was necessary to obtain un­
common AE reporting data. Real-world data played an important role in
assessing irAEs associated with ICIs. Generally speaking, life-threatening
irAEs were rare and may be considered other well-known conditions.
Through investigating pharmacovigilance databases, especially largesamples of real-world data, it could possible to better obtain clinical
characterization of irAEs, such as timing, outcomes and prognosis [13].
People could better monitor the safety profile of medicines, timely
detection of rare and life-threatening irAEs.
Food and Drug Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) was one of
the largest pharmacovigilance databases with a large number of adverse
events and personal information of patients related to immune check­
point inhibitors. Data mining techniques were increasingly used to
explore and analyze massive data to identify potential associations be­
tween drugs and adverse events. This study aimed to conduct data
mining to comprehensively evaluate and characterize ICI-associated
irAEs by FAERS databases, serving as a reference for further preven­
tion and management.

(OUTC), report sources (RPSR), therapy start dates and end dates for
reported drugs (THER), and indications for drug administration (INDI).
A total of 13,638,964 reports were retrieved from the FAERS database.
According to the FDA’s recommendation, we removed duplicated re­
cords before performing statistical analysis, by selecting the latest
FDA_DT when CASEID were the same, and choosing the higher PRI­
MARYID when the CASEID and FDA_DT were the same, reducing the
data to 11,450,529 (Fig. 1). All the data downloaded from the U.S. FDA
website was imported into SQL server for further analysis.
2.2. Target drug and irAEs
We searched ICIs using brand names and generic names approved by
FDA to search for ICIs in the FAERS database including CTLA-4 (ipili­
mumab, tremelimumab), PD-1 (nivolumab, cemiplimab, pem­
brolizumab), and PD-L1 (atezolizumab, avelumab, durvalumab) (S1
Table for detail).
AEs in the FAERS database were coded in terms of Preferred Terms
(PTs) from the ICH Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (Med­
DRA). The structure of MedDRA allowed PTs dividing into five levels.
Researchers had conducted studies on different ICIs associated irAEs
based on the pharmacovigilance database. However, there was no
consensus on the definition of irAEs. The reported incidence of any
grade adverse events was as high as 90% in ipilimumab therapy [14].
The most common irAEs were colitis, dermatitis, thyroiditis, pneumo­
nitis or hepatitis [15]. In addition to the above irAEs, irAEs were widely
reported to have effects on kidneys, cardiovascular, nervous system and
eyes, but the frequency was low [16]. Some papers had studied certain
category of irAEs such as endocrinopathies toxicities [17], neurologic
toxicities [18], cardiovascular toxicities [19], ocular toxicities [20],
hematological toxicities [21], cardiotoxicities [22], myositis [23], hep­
atitis [24] and so on. Shiori Hasegawa et al classified PTs according to

2. Methods
2.1. Data source
The data of the retrospective pharmacovigilance study was from
FAERS database. FAERS not only collected data from the US but also
from other countries and regions. We screened a total of 64 quarterly
documents covering the period from January 2004 to December 2019.
The FAERS data files contained seven types of datasets: patient de­
mographic and administrative information (DEMO), drug information
(DRUG), coded for the adverse events (REAC), patient outcomes

the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities and evaluated profile of
irAEs based on the Japanese Pharmacovigilance Database [25]. Besides
these, some societies had formulated corresponding treatment or man­
agement guidelines. For example, the clinical guidelines of American
Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) indicated recommendations for
specific organ system-based toxicity diagnosis and management [26].
The Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC) Toxicity Management
Working Group presented their recommendations on managing toxic­
ities associated with immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy [16]. Based
on clinical treatment guidelines, systematic reviews, meta-analyses and
ICI-related toxicity articles [7,11,14–30], IrAEs were divided into 11
groups: Skin Toxicities, Gastrointestinal Toxicities, Hepatitis, Endocrine
Toxicities, Lung Toxicities, Musculoskeletal Toxicities, Cardiovascular
Toxicities, Hematologic Toxicities, Renal Toxicities, Nervous System
Toxicities, Ocular Toxicities and select PTs for each group (S2 Table for
detail).

2.3. Data mining
The current study used disproportionality analysis including
Reporting odds ratio (ROR) and proportional reporting ratio (PRR) for
signal detection. Disproportional AEs and drug combinations were
identified by a two-by-two table (S3 Table). We assessed the association
between the target drug and the target AE, by comparing the proportion
of interested AE of target drug with the proportion of the same AE of a
control group of drugs in the database. The detected signal was defined
as the signal simultaneously detected by ROR and PRR. The equations
and signal criteria of ROR and PRR were shown in Supplementary
Table 4.
We analyzed the association among ICI regimens (monotherapy and
combination therapy) and irAEs. In order to obtain accurate results, we
restricted specific ICI as “primary suspect (PS)” in the “ROLE_COD” field
of “DRUG” files. Monotherapy was defined as the application of a spe­
cific ICI with no other ICI being listed as “second suspect”, “concomi­
tant” or “interacting”. Combination therapy was defined as the
concurrent usage of PD-1, PD-L1 or CTLA-4 inhibitors which meant a
specific ICI was “primary suspect”, with another ICI being listed as
“second suspect”, “concomitant” or “interacting”.
The time to ICI-associated irAEs onset was evaluated for each ICI
regimen. It was defined as the time interval between the START_DT
(date of ICIs treatment initiation) and EVENT_DT (date of adverse event
onset). Inaccurate data entry, missing specific data and input error re­
ports (EVENT_DT earlier than START_DT) were excluded. Besides, re­
ports with fatal events attributed to drug toxicity were counted, and the
fatality proportion was calculated as dividing the fatal outcomes by the
total number of reported events.
2.4. Statistical analysis
We used descriptive analysis to summarize the clinical features of the
ICI-associated irAEs from the FAERS database. Time to irAEs onset
among different ICI regimens was compared using the Kruskal-Wallis
test. Pearson’s chi-squared test or Fisher’s exact test was used to
compare the fatality proportion across different ICI regimens. The P
value less than 0.05 indicated a statistical significance. All the data
analysis processes were performed by SPSS 24.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL,
USA).

of reported cases had gradually increased from 2007 to 2019. The
country with the most reports was America (42.36%), followed by Japan
(19.64%), France (8.09%), Germany (5.40%) and Britain (2.81%). Most
reports were submitted by health-care professionals, including physician
(36.64%), pharmacist (4.95%) and other health-professionals (30.30%).

A total of 72,667 ICI-associated adverse events were documented in
the FAERS database, among which 32,441 reports were related to
immune-related adverse events. We summarized the clinical character­
istics of patients; these features were described in Table 1. The number

More male than female patients (57.55% vs. 33.25%) were reported.
Malignant melanoma was the most reported indication (19.24%), fol­
lowed by non-small cell lung cancer (16.31%). Among the 8 ICI mono­
therapies, nivolumab counted the most report (n = 15450, 49.90%),
followed by pembrolizumab (n = 7177, 23.18%), ipilimumab (n = 4604,
14.87%), atezolizumab (n = 2195, 7.09%), durvalumab (n = 1190,
3.84%), avelumab (n = 199, 0.64%), cemiplimab (n = 142, 0.46%) and
tremelimumab (n = 3, 0.01%). In combination therapy the highest
number of reports was for ipilimumab plus nivolumab (n = 1376,
92.91%), followed by ipilimumab plus pembrolizumab (n = 98, 6.62%).

Nivolumab plus ipilimumab increased the signal of Gastrointestinal
toxicities compared with nivolumab alone. Pembrolizumab plus ipili­
mumab increased signals of skin toxicities, gastrointestinal toxicities
and musculoskeletal toxicities compared with pembrolizumab alone.
The most frequently reported AEs in ICI regimens were the Colitis (2426,
8.21%), pneumonitis (2039, 6.90%), Interstitial lung disease (1392,
4.71%), Hypothyroidism (1272, 4.30%) and Diarrhea (1239, 4.19%) in
which Colitis, pneumonia and interstitial lung disease generated signals
across all ICI treatment regimens. In addition, myocarditis and myositis
generated signals in all ICIs. Only 3 cases of tremelimumab mono­
therapy and 7 cases of tremelimumab plus durvalumab were reported,
their signal could not be calculated by disproportionality analysis.

3.2. Disproportionality analysis

3.3. Time to irAEs onset

Among all ICI regimens, the signals were detected in five regimens.
The combination therapy of ipilimumab plus pembrolizumab had the
strongest statistical association with ICI-associated irAEs. It was worth
noting that all anti-CTLA-4 regimens and the combination regimens had
generated signals. The detail of signal detection was described in
Table 2.
A total of 53 signals of ICI-associated irAEs in 11 groups were
detected for all ICI regimens. We listed the signals among all ICI regi­
mens in Supplementary Table 5. The differences among anti-PD-1, antiPD-L1 and anti-CTLA-4 had attracted our attention. Anti-PD-1 generated
more signals of ocular toxicities than anti-PD-L1, while anti-PD-L1 re­
ported more signals of hematologic toxicities. Compared with anti-PD-1
and anti-PD-L1, the signal of gastrointestinal toxicities had been re­
ported in almost all CTLA-4 regimens. Furthermore, Endocrine toxicities
and lung toxicities were detected in all ICI regimens. Except for cemi­
plimab monotherapy, all regimens were detected nervous system tox­
icities. There were no signal of cardiovascular toxicities. For
musculoskeletal toxicities and skin toxicities, only the regimen of
pembrolizumab plus ipilimumab generated the signal. Compared with
monotherapy, combination therapy obviously generated other signals.

A total of 14,732 ICI-associated irAEs reported onset time. The me­
dian onset time was 42 days (interquartile range [IQR] 16–98 days). We
showed the onset time of irAEs for each ICI regimen in Fig. 2 (there were
few data on tremelimumab, ipilimumab plus pembrolizumab and dur­
valumab plus tremelimumab, they were not shown in Fig. 2). Among all
ICI regimens, we found that there was a significant difference in the
onset time of irAEs across different ICI regimens (Kruskal-Wallis test, P
< 0.05). The shortest median onset time of irAEs was 27 days for ipili­
mumab plus pembrolizumab (IQR 7.5–57), and the longest of 73.5 days
for avelumab (IQR 27–170.75). in addition, the median time to onset
was 30 days for pembrolizumab (IQR 12–84), 34 days for durvalumab
(IQR 15–82), 36 days for atezolizumab (IQR 13–105), 42 days for
nivolumab (IQR 16–112), 48 days for cemiplimab (IQR 12.75–110) and
43.5 days for ipilimumab plus nivolumab (IQR 21–90). It could be seen
from the data that patients treated with ipilimumab plus nivolumab
appeared to have earlier onset time than those receiving ipilimumab
alone (43.5 [IQR 21–90] VS 44 [IQR 16–112]). The onset time of ipili­
mumab plus pembrolizumab was also earlier compared with ipilimumab
alone (27 [IQR 7.5–57] VS 44 [IQR 24–71]). But there were no signifi­
cant differences in the onset time between monotherapy and combina­
tion regimen (ipilimumab VS ipilimumab plus nivolumab, p = 0.527,
ipilimumab VS ipilimumab plus pembrolizumab, p = 0.145. nivolumab
VS nivolumab plus ipilimumab, p = 0.732. pembrolizumab VS pem­
brolizumab plus ipilimumab, p = 0.622). Since there were only two
reports of tremelimumab and seven reports of tremelimumab plus dur­
valumab available for the calculation, it was difficult to make a com­
parison between tremelimumab and tremelimumab plus durvalumab.

3.4. Fatality proportions
To determine the prognosis of patients with adverse events after ICIs
use, we assessed the outcome of reports including fatality proportions.
All results were shown in Fig. 3. It was worth noting that the result was
fatality proportion rather than incidence because the data in our study
were from patients with adverse events, not all the drug users.
According to our analysis, Fatality proportions accounted for
19.12%. The high mortality of ICIs was frequently reported by clinical
trials [31] and ICI-associated irAEs portended poor outcomes. Among all
monotherapies, the highest fatality proportion occurred in pem­
brolizumab (20.84%, 1496 death out of 7177 cases), following by
nivolumab (20.73%, 3203 death out of 15,450 cases), and the lowest
one was cemiplimab (12.68% 18 death out of 142 cases). Based on the
collected data, Fatality proportions existed significant differences
among different ICI regimens (Pearson’s chi-squared test for overall
comparison, p < 0.05). Among combination therapies, the fatality pro­
portion of nivolumab plus ipilimumab was lower than nivolumab alone
(13.44% VS 20.73%, p < 0.05). THE fatality proportion of pem­
brolizumab plus ipilimumab was also lower than pembrolizumab alone
(9.18% VS 20.84%, P < 0.05). In addition, the fatality proportion of
various toxicities were compared (S6 table). We found gastrointestinal
toxicities and lung toxicities had a higher fatality proportion, while

ocular toxicities and skin toxicities were lower in all ICI regimens. As an
anti-CTLA-4 agent, ipilimumab monotherapy reported the highest fa­
tality proportion of gastrointestinal toxicities, close to 50%, while lung
toxicities were lower compared with anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 agents.
Patients treated with ipilimumab plus pembrolizumab accounted for a
higher fatality proportion in terms of endocrine toxicities, nervous sys­
tem toxicities and skin toxicities. Lung toxicities of durvalumab mono­
therapy, hematological toxicities of avelumab monotherapy, renal and
skin toxicities of cemiplimab monotherapy reported the highest fatality
proportion. The number of reports of tremelimumab and tremelimumab
plus durvalumab were not enough to draw a conclusion.

have listed these emerging findings in Table 3.
Immune checkpoint inhibitors represented a huge shift in cancer
treatment from the traditional chemotherapy model to the immuno­
therapy model. Besides their impressive and durable effect in clinical
practice, the risk of ICIs was significant. Some studies indicated that ICIs
had a delayed onset and prolonged duration of irAEs compared with the
AEs caused by chemotherapy [32]. So timely identification and early
personalized management were important [33].
The characters of ICI-associated irAEs varied with the type and
combination of ICIs. In our study, the onset time of different ICI regi­
mens were significantly different (Kruskal-Wallis test, P < 0.05). The
majority of ICI-associated irAEs occurred in the first few weeks after
medication and then possibility gradually decreased, but it was still
possible for patients to have irAEs in the later course of treatment, even
months or years [34]. Avelumab had the longest median onset time
among ICIs, and even 24.59% of adverse events were reported after 25
weeks of treatment.
In our analysis, we found significant statistical differences in the
fatality proportion. On the whole, fatality proportion of anti-PD-1 and
anti-PD-L1 agents were remarkably similar except lung toxicities. AntiCTLA-4 treatments were commonly associated with gastrointestinal

4. Discussion
This was an updated comprehensive study to describe and charac­
terize irAEs with ICIs following the use of various ICI regimens. We
analyzed ICI-associated adverse events from FAERS database by mea­
sures of disproportionality and identified characteristics and differences
between ICI regimens and ICI-associated irAEs to update the safety in­
formation. The results of our study may help medical staffs and patients
to detect ICI-associated irAEs early and reduce the potential risks. We

and interstitial lung disease (ILD). Limited evidence on ICI-associated
ILD (ICI-ILD) was published and mainly focused on Nivolumab and
Pembrolizumab [42]. However, as the analysis results showed that all
ICI regimens might induce the interstitial lung diseases, it was vital to
raise vigilance on the safety issue on ICI-ILD for all approved ICIs rather
than focus on Nivolumab and Pembrolizumab only. Another urging
question on ICI-ILD was how to diagnose ICI-ILD, and how to make a
differential diagnosis between ICI-ILD and pneumonia in cancer pa­
tients, especially under the circumstance of COVID-19 pandemic. The
diagnosis of ICI-ILD was difficult because the symptoms were not spe­
cific compared with pneumonia. ICI-related pneumonitis was one of the
most frequent lung toxicities which was defined as focal or diffuse
inflammation of the lung parenchyma [26]. In a network meta-analysis,
pneumonitis was also the most common cause of grade 5 treatmentrelated adverse events (TRAEs) [43].Symptoms of dyspnea, cough,
fever, and chest pain were often reported in patients with ICI-related
pneumonitis in the literature, which are similar to pneumonitis [44].
Some characters of ICI-ILD might help in diagnosis and differential
diagnosis as listed below. DELAUNAY et al. showed that the median time
to ICI-ILD onset was 2.3 (0.2–27.4) months. And 56.3% (27 of 48)
experienced grades 1–2 and 43.8% (21 of 48) experienced grades 3–5
[45]. Also, the most predominant lesions were ground-glass opacities
found on a lung CT scan and organizing pneumonia was the most
common pattern, thus high-resolution computed tomography scan
pattern was highly recommended for patients with newly detected
interstitial lung disease [46] but the onset time of ILD might be not
related to radiographic patterns [45]. Broncho-alveolar lavage might
also help to identify it when T-lymphocytic alveolitis happens [45] and
in some cases, flow cytometry results of Broncho-alveolar lavage fluid
showed the elevation of proportions of CD8+ T cells positive for both
PD-1 and TIM-3 or for TIGIT which also helps to identify [47]. Consid­
ering risk factors when diagnosing ICI-ILD was also important. Smoking
(especially ≥ 50 pack-year) [48], chronic obstructive pulmonary dis­
ease, Pre-existing interstitial lung abnormalities [49] (for example,
ground glass attenuation [50,51]), and pulmonary fibrosis may enhance
the drug-related lung toxicity [52]. Furthermore, in a meta-analysis,
patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) had a significantly
higher incidence of ILD compared with melanoma patients [53].
Epidemiological studies had provided clues to the population suscepti­
bility of ILD and indicated ILD may be more common in Japanese
population [54]. Genetic polymorphisms may help to explain this phe­
nomena. A study of familial interstitial lung disease in Japan found
mutations in SFTPC and ABCA3 [55]. In another study, In another study,
researchers found that a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in intron
2 of the telomere-associated gene of TERT was significantly associated
with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) in Japanese patients [56].
Geographic isolation could lead to the development and accumulation of
genetic polymorphisms in the Japanese population [57]. This may
explain why Japan had the second number of reports. Due to the limi­
tation of the FAERS database, the majority of reports came from the
United States although it was a global pharmacovigilance database [58],
the genetic susceptibility after ICI treatment still needed further study.
Lung sarcoidosis were frequent complications in lung cancer [59].
Interestingly, sarcoidosis caused by ICI regimens had recently attracted
researchers’ attention. Signals of sarcoidosis (S7 table) involving mul­
tiple organ systems induced by ICIs were also generated in our research
which was similar to the results of AUBART et al.’s research [59].
AUBART et al. conducted the study based on VigiBase of WHO including
130 countries’ data. Their results showed that ipilimumab, nivolumab
and pembrolizumab were involved in sarcoidosis, pulmonary sarcoid­
osis and cutaneous sarcoidosis. The relationship between the occurrence
of sarcoidosis and the ICI administration was hard to conclude as it may
be a delayed diagnosis of lung cancer complications or pre-existing
sarcoidosis. However, once ICI-related sarcoidosis was diagnosed by
excluding other reasons, it was recommended to stop the ICI treatment.
Furthermore, Durvalumab monotherapy reported the highest PRR value

toxicities, and the risk of lung toxicities was lower than anti-PD-1 and
anti-PD-L1 agents. Furthermore, compared with monotherapy, combi­
nation therapy accounted for a higher fatality proportion in terms of
endocrine toxicities (9.18% VS 6.43%), which may be related to the
reason that pituitary and the thyroid gland were most frequently
affected by combination therapy [35]. In terms of lung toxicities, dur­
valumab had the highest fatality proportion compared with other ICIs,
which had caught our attention. Serval clinical trials of durvalumab
were terminated on account of severe lung toxicities including pneu­
monitis and interstitial lung disease [36–39]. One of the trials on dur­
valumab combined with AZD9291 reported that 14.7% of patients
occurred grade 3–4 interstitial lung disease. However, according to our
data, up to 65.39% patients used durvalumab for treating no-small cell
lung cancer, so death may be related to disease progression rather than
durvalumab toxicity. A variety of hematological toxicity signals was
related to ICIs. Although the mechanism of ICI-associated hematological
toxicities was unclear, ICI-related abnormal T-cell activation may be
related to the hematological toxicities [21]. A systematic review sug­
gested that avelumab caused a lower risk of treatment-related adverse
events (TRAEs) [40], but according to our study, avelumab showed the
highest fatality proportion of hematological toxicities and much higher
than other anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1agents. This may be caused by
avelumab enhanced antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity
(ADCC) instead of the PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibition [41]. Although some
studies suggested that the safety profile of cemiplimab was comparable
with other anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 agents, our study indicated that
cemiplimab-induced renal and skin toxicities, even if they were rare,
seemed to have a worse outcome. Further safety studies were necessary.
According to disproportionality analysis, we obtained some unique
findings. Firstly, lung toxicities and endocrine toxicities generated sig­
nals in all ICI regimens. Secondly, the most frequently reported ICIassociated irAEs were colitis, pneumonitis and interstitial lung disease
that generated signals in all ICI regimens.
With the study of the ICI-related lung toxicities gradually deepening,
interstitial lung disease attracted the attention of researchers. Our study
also supported the association between immune checkpoint inhibitors

in terms of lung toxicities which might be related radiation pneumonitis
(RP), as radiation pneumonitis contributed the most cases of durvalu­
mab with lung toxicities. As PACIFIC trial showed great benefits using
consolidation durvalumab following concurrent chemoradiation (CCRT)
[60], the concurrent regime of chemoradiotherapy plus durvalumab was
recommended by national comprehensive cancer network (NCCN) for
patients with unresectable stage III non-small-cell lung cancer. Some
studies suggested that durvalumab increased the risk of RP [61].
Although using consolidation durvalumab following CCRT achieved
great clinical benefits, active monitoring and appropriated management
for RP were necessary for patients who use durvalumab and receive
radiotherapy.
Although atezolizumab, one of novel anti-PD-L1 agent, was reported
to have the best general safety for severe or life-threatening AEs [40,62],
more signals were generated for atezolizumab than other anti-PD-L1
agents in this study such as hepatitis and renal toxicities. Few clinical
trials reported the above AEs. However, we noticed that some cases of
atezolizumab-associated hepatitis and renal toxicities had been reported
[63–65]. The toxicities of atezolizumab deserved further attention of
clinicians.
Theoretically, the combination of anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1/L1
agents could show further clinical benefits due to their different mech­
anisms [66]. But compared with monotherapy, irAEs of combination
therapy had a shorter median onset time and affected more organs and
tissues [67,68], such as gastrointestinal toxicities, skin toxicities and
endocrine toxicities. In a systematic review and network meta-analysis,
the main ipilimumab-associated irAEs were gastrointestinal toxicities
[62], which were consistent with our results that all regimens related to
ipilimumab generated the signal of gastrointestinal toxicities. The skin
toxicities with combination therapy were worthy of attention, especially
ipilimumab plus pembrolizumab with few reports in previous study.
However, skin toxicities on the safety and efficacy of immunotherapy
treatments seemed to be controversial [69]. Some studies had associated
skin toxicities with improved clinical outcomes and suggested that skin
toxicities reflected systemically enhanced T cell function [70–72]. But
no more clinical benefit had been reported in patients with severe skin
toxicities related AEs. This might be due to the treatment with cortico­
steroids after severe skin toxicities, which reduced the clinical benefits
of immunotherapy. Given the impressive benefits from ICI combination
therapy, there was considerable interest in minimizing irAEs and
maintaining efficacy. Current studies had found that ipilimumab had
dose-dependent effects. The risk of the 3 mg/kg ipilimumab regimens
was significantly lower than that of the 10 mg/kg ipilimumab regimens
[73]. Therefore, altering the dose of ipilimumab was an appealing
strategy. The CheckMate 511 trial showed that raising the dose of ipi­
limumab from 3 mg/kg to 1 mg/kg leaded to better safety profile
without affecting the efficacy in combination therapy [74]. More studies
were needed to assess the benefits. In some meta-analysis, the incidence
of hypophysitis notably depended on different ICI regimens [30,75].
Hypophysitis were considered to be the most frequent endocrine irAEs
treated with ipilimumab administration [28]. Our research supported
this view in terms of the number of reports or signal strength (S8 Table).
The incidence of hypophysitis in patients receiving combination ther­
apy, especially ipilimumab plus nivolumab was significantly higher than
that of ipilimumab monotherapy. Symptoms of endocrine toxicities
could be non-specific, making great challenges to clinicians. Hormonal
test and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) were recommended for
differential diagnosis [76,77]. But for patients treated with anti-PD-1/
anti-PD-L1agents, no abnormalities on MRI may be common [28].
This was one of the potential reasons that endocrine toxicity of PD-1 and
PD-L1 were underestimated. The endocrine toxicity of PD-1 and PD-L1
inhibitors was controversial. PD-L1, theoretically, might be less toxic
due to PD-L2 specificity [78]. But PD-L1 had been on the market later
and had fewer indications approved by FDA. So, PD-L1 inhibitors were
less frequently used than PD-1 inhibitors. These observations needed to
be further studied in the future.

Although this research had advantages based on real-world data and
the data mining techniques, we must admit that the analysis of AEs had
certain limitations based on the US FDA adverse event reporting system:
A) confounding in disproportionality: the actual differences in drug
utilization and multiple unmeasured confounders such as potential
drug-drug interactions, comorbidities and combination medications
[79]. B) reporting bias: underreporting, overreporting, duplication,
missed data, misspelled drug names and inadequate data on population
exposure. For this study, a large number of reports lacked the infor­
mation of gender and age, which leads to the difficulty of the statistical
analysis as well as the inaccuracy of the results [11,80,81]. C) clinical
information such as the severity of the patient’s cancer and other
treatment measures were lacking. D) the limitation of reported outcome:
there was no certainty between death and ICIs use, and death may be
more related to disease progression. E) inability to infer firm causality:
disproportionality measures of PRR and ROR neither quantified risk nor
existed causality, but only provided an estimate of the signal strength,
which was only statistically significant [82]. So PRR and ROR were in­
dicators of increased risks in AE reporting [83], whether there was a
causal relationship remains to be further proved by experimental
studies.
Notwithstanding these limitations of this study, pharmacovigilance
assessment based on SRS represented an important way to monitor drug
safety and find new signals. Our results would provide valuable clues to
further assess clinically relevant differences exist among ICIs.
5. Conclusion
Signals of lung toxicities and endocrine toxicities were generated in
all ICI regimens. Colitis, pneumonitis and interstitial lung disease were
the most frequently reported ICI-associated irAEs. Overall, each ICI
regimens had different characteristics. The ocular toxicities of anti-PD-1
agents, the hematologic toxicities of anti-PD-L1 agents, and the gastro­
intestinal toxicities of anti-CTLA-4 agents were all worthy of attention of
clinicians. Compared with monotherapy, combination therapy had a
higher risk of irAEs. Further studies were encouraged to evaluate clinical
differences in ICI regimens.
