Abstract
Background Although the use of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) has been reported in patients with atrial fibrillation
(AF), there is currently no consensus on the occurrence or characteristics of the hemorrhage risk in different antithrombotic regimens.
Methods Disproportionality and Bayesian analyses were performed in mining data of suspected hemorrhagic events after
antithrombotic drug use from the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) from January 2004 to September 2019.
The time to onset and fatality rate of hemorrhage following different antithrombotic regimens were also compared.
Results A total of 84,998 reports of hemorrhage-related adverse events with the use of antithrombotic drugs were identified.
The patients included were mostly from the Americas (80.87%) and Europe (13.22%), with most data submitted by
nonhealthcare professionals. Among the seven antithrombotic drug monotherapies, betrixaban had the highest association
with hemorrhage based on the highest reporting odds ratio (ROR, 829.95; 95% CI = 113.61-6063.15), proportional reporting
ratio (PRR, 24.68, χ2 = 804.24), and multi-item gamma Poisson shrinker (MGPS, 24.68, 95% one-sided CI = 4.67). The
combination therapies of clopidogrel plus new oral anticoagulants had higher RORs, PRRs, and empirical Bayesian geometric means (EBGMs) than the antithrombotic drug monotherapies. Hemorrhage associated with rivaroxaban plus
clopidogrel appeared to have an earlier onset (171 days vs 219 days, 95% two-sided CI =68.68-27.34, p < 0.0001) and a
lower fatality rate (15.30% vs 17.74%, p<0.05) than that associated with rivaroxaban monotherapy.
Conclusion This study provides a relevant overview of the hemorrhagic complications/fatalities associated with different antithrombotic regimens in their real-world use. Among the combination therapies, clopidogrel plus DOACs were found to have
stronger associations with hemorrhage than traditional dual antithrombotic therapies. Rivaroxaban showed a stronger association
with hemorrhage than other antithrombotic drug monotherapies, and apixaban monotherapy appeared to have weaker associations with hemorrhage than others.

Drugs that interfere with blood coagulation are of interest
within the field of cardiovascular therapy. Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) have been an effective measure to
prevent or treat thromboembolic diseases and to reduce
atherosclerotic events (myocardial infarction (MI), stroke,
death due to vascular causes), thus becoming the main
therapeutic drugs for preventing venous thromboembolism (VTE) and reducing the risk of ischemic stroke associated with atrial fibrillation (AF) [1–3]. Since 2008, six
kinds of DOACs have been approved by the US Food and
Drug Administration (FDA) and are available in Europe.

Cardiovasc Drugs Ther

These novel direct-acting agents selective for a specific
coagulation factor (IIa or Xa) demonstrate potential advantages over vitamin K antagonists (VKAs), such as
fixed dosing and predictable pharmacokinetics, rapid onset and offset of action [4, 5], the absence of an effect of
dietary vitamin K intake on their activity, and fewer drug
interactions, which reduces the need for routine laboratory
monitoring [6, 7].
It has previously been observed that compared with warfarin, DOACs have the same anticoagulant effects and are associated with a significantly lower risk of bleeding [8, 9].
Moreover, the 2019 ACC/AHA Guidelines on the Primary
Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease indicated that a
double-therapy regimen (oral anticoagulant plus single antiplatelet therapy with a P2Y12 inhibitor) by the time of hospital
discharge should be considered for patients with both AF and
coronary heart disease [10]. Hence, anticoagulation also imposes an increased risk for hemorrhage events, and this risk
must be assessed to determine the appropriateness of a given
treatment plan for each patient.
Although several observational studies [11–15] have compared the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding among different
DOAC regimens, there is still very little scientific understanding of real-world data for these alternatives; for example, the
optimal time to onset of dual therapy has not yet been
established. Our research provides an intuitive visual model
by overviewing real-world data to facilitate the initial assessment and identification of gaps among different sources of
data, which might help to refine the design processes to better
study and provide stronger evidence for the safe clinical use of
antithrombotic drugs.

Material and Methods
Data Source
We conducted a retrospective analysis of publicly available data collected from the FDA Adverse Event
Reporting System (FAERS) database from January 2004
to September 2019. Reports with missing outcome data
were excluded, and 84,998 reports were finally included
for further analysis.
The annual reported numbers of adverse drug events
(ADEs) described as hemorrhage were determined. Drug information (DRUG) and administrative information (DEMO)
were also identified. The distribution of serious ADE reports
by demographic patient outcomes (OUTC) and DEMO were
determined. The sources (consumer, healthcare professional,
or other) of these serious ADE reports, OUTC, and the primary suspected drugs leading to serious ADEs (death, disability,
and other serious outcomes) were identified and ranked.

Adverse Event and Drug Identification
The drugs in the FAERS database can be input arbitrarily;
therefore, MICROMEDEX® (Index Nominum) was utilized
as a dictionary for the antithrombotic drugs (Table 1). Adverse
events were investigated using the MedDRA PT terms “bleeding (10005103), hemorrhage (10055798), peptic ulcer
(10034341), intracranial hemorrhage (10018985), thrombocytopenia (10043554), hemolytic anemia (10018916), purpura
(10037549), bruising (10006504), epistaxis (10015090), and
gastrointestinal hemorrhage (10017955)” in the REAC files.

Data Mining
Statistical analysis was performed using disproportionality
analysis and Bayesian analysis to identify an association between a drug and an adverse event. In this study, adverse
events were extracted when at least one of four indices met
the criteria. Table 2 provides the equations and criteria for the
four algorithms [16–24].
The associations between hemorrhage and different antithrombotic regimens (monotherapies and combination therapies) were compared. Monotherapy here was defined as a
specific drug used alone, which meant this specific drug was
the “primary suspect” in the ROLE_COD field of DRUG files
and with no other drug in the same report as the “second
suspect” or a “concomitant” or “interacting” drug.
Combination therapy here was defined as the concurrent administration of clopidogrel and DOACs, which meant a specific drug was the “primary suspect”, and another drug was the
“second suspect” or a “concomitant” or “interacting” drug.
The time of hemorrhage was evaluated for each antithrombotic regimen. It was defined as the interval between the
EVENT_DT (adverse event onset date) and the START_DT
(start date of antithrombotic drug use). However, reports with
input errors (EVENT_DT earlier than START_DT) or inaccurate date entries were excluded. In addition, reports with
fatal events attributed to antithrombotics were counted, and
the fatality rate was calculated as the number of fatal events
divided by the total number of hemorrhagic events associated
with each antithrombotic regimen.

Statistical Analysis
Descriptive analyses were used to summarize the clinical characteristics of the patients with antithrombotic drug-associated
hemorrhage collected from the FAERS database. The time to
onset of antithrombotic drug-associated hemorrhage was
compared between different antithrombotic regimens using
nonparametric tests (the Mann–Whitney test for dichotomous
variables and the Kruskal–Wallis test when there were more
than two subgroups of respondents) because the data were not
normally distributed. The fatality rate was compared between

different antithrombotic regimens using Pearson’s chi-square
test or Fisher’s exact test. Statistical significance was determined at p < 0.05 with 95% confidence intervals. Data mining
and all statistical analyses were performed with SAS, version
9.4 (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC, USA). Cox regression
analysis was performed to estimate the hazard ratios of the
outcomes, which were compared between patients aged ≥75
and <75 years and among the three elderly subpopulations
(age ranges: 75–79, 80–84, and ≥ 85 years). P values were
calculated using the log-rank test. A competing risk analysis
was performed using Fine and Gray’s proportional subhazards
model [25–28] to compare the cumulative incidence function
of major bleeding and stroke/non-central nervous system
(CNS) systemic embolism (SE)/MI events among the three
elderly subpopulations with “death before event occurrence”
as the competing risk.

Results
Descriptive Analysis
The baseline characteristics are shown in Table 3. Of the
84,998 patients who completed the 1-year follow-up, 44,688
(52.57%) patients were aged ≥65 years. The highest number
of hemorrhage reports was for rivaroxaban monotherapy (n =
Table 2

42,382), followed by dabigatran etexilate monotherapy (n =
18,535). Hemorrhage adverse events were the most common
indications reported in patients with AF (30.61%). The patients affected were more often males than females (44.62%
vs 41.14%). Most of the patients were from the Americas
(80.87%) and Europe (13.22%), and most data were submitted
by nonhealthcare professionals (58.54%). Because there were
only 69 reports of hemorrhage from 1998 to 2002, the data
could not be used to calculate the time to onset, but there was a
clear trend that the number of antithrombotic-related hemorrhage reports increased with the passage of time.

Disproportionality Analysis and Bayesian Analysis
Overall, based on the criteria for the four algorithms, hemorrhage signs were detected for all seven antithrombotic drug
monotherapies and sic DOAC combination therapies. The results are listed in Table 4. Among all antithrombotic drug
monotherapies, the association with hemorrhage was noteworthy for rivaroxaban because it had the highest reporting
odds ratio (ROR), proportional reporting ratio (PRR), and
empirical Bayesian geometric mean (EBGM), while apixaban
appeared to have weaker associations with hemorrhage than
others. Among the combination therapies, the clopidogrel plus
DOAC combination was found to be more strongly associated
with hemorrhage than traditional dual antithrombotic

Time to Onset of Antithrombotic Drug-Associated
Hemorrhage
The time to onset of hemorrhage following the initiation of
each antithrombotic regimen is described in Table 5. In an
analogous treatment paradigm, individuals with AF often receive long-term anticoagulation treatment for the prevention
of cerebrovascular events. According to the table, except for
clopidogrel monotherapy, the majority of hemorrhagic events
appeared after the first month of treatment with the different
anticoagulants and combinations. There were significant differences in the time to onset among these monotherapies (p <
0.0001), and patients treated with a combination of dabigatran
etexilate plus clopidogrel appeared to have a significantly
higher proportion of antithrombotic drug-associated

hemorrhagic events than patients treated with other DOAC
regimens (30.96%).

Fatality Due to Antithrombotic Drug-Associated
Hemorrhage
A time-to-event, survival analytic approach was taken. To
determine the prognosis of hemorrhage after antithrombotic
drug use, we assessed the rates of fatality due to hemorrhagerelated adverse events following various antithrombotic regimens, and the results are shown in Fig. 1. It was observed that
hemorrhage generally led to poor outcomes, with 16.39% of
events resulting in death. The chi-square test and Fisher’s
exact test showed (Table 6) that there were significant differences in the fatality rate among different antithrombotic
monotherapies and among the regimens. The number of reports of antithrombotic-associated hemorrhagic events with
the combined therapies of darexaban plus clopidogrel and
betrixaban plus clopidogrel was zero (Table 4). Therefore,
we did not include these two sets of data in Table 6. Among
the combination therapies, except rivaroxaban plus
clopidogrel compared with dabigatran etexilate plus
clopidogrel, there were no significant differences in the fatality rate among the other dual antithrombotic therapies.

Discussion
The principal aim of this study was to evaluate the safety of
various antithrombotic regimens in real-world practice. The
assessment and characterization of antithrombotic drugrelated hemorrhage are quite challenging because of the low
incidence and various manifestations of this type of

hemorrhage. Several clinical risk scores are available to guide
the choice of antithrombotic therapy. Due to these complexities, practicing physicians usually have to achieve a delicate
balance and make a proper decision. In the antithrombotic
treatment paradigm, risk scores are now commonly used as
clinical decision support tools to initiate anticoagulation based
on stroke risk (e.g., the CHADS2 and CHA2DS2-VASc
scores) [29, 30]. More recently, bleeding risk scores have been
developed to go hand-in-hand with stroke risk scores to determine the potential net clinical benefit of anticoagulation and to
guide patient follow-up throughout therapy.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to
describe differences in the associations, timing, and prognosis
of hemorrhage following the use of various antithrombotic
drugs in real-world practice based on the FAERS
pharmacovigilance database, and it is the largest collection
of such cases to date. This is a worldwide study using a large
“real-world” cohort of patients treated with anticoagulation,
which shows that all six studied DOACs were associated with
hemorrhage as an adverse event.
A previous report [31] has shown that a consistently higher
risk of ischemic stroke in Asians than in non-Asians was also
noted in patients who received DOACs in randomized trials.
Goto et al. [32] showed that apixaban resulted in similar reductions in stroke or SE and major bleeding and greater reductions in major or clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding in
patients from East Asia. In a study by Chan et al. [33] that
reported the largest real-world practice study among Asian
patients with nonvalvular AF, apixaban was associated with
a lower risk of major bleeding than rivaroxaban and
dabigatran, whereas the risk of major bleeding was comparable between edoxaban and apixaban. In our study, we further
found that the majority of patients were from the Americas

(80.87%), which may be related to the database being from the
FDA.
In addition to the above difficulties, bleeding complications
related to oral anticoagulants have made physicians extremely
cautious when they prescribe these drugs, especially for elderly patients. Several reports [34–36] have shown increased
rates of major bleeding with advancing age in patients.
Renal hypofunction and a higher prevalence of cardiovascular
conditions occur naturally with age and are important factors
when considering antithrombotic drugs. All DOACs have a
certain degree of renal clearance, and the assessment of renal
function (creatinine clearance, such as the Cockcroft–Gault
formula) at the initiation of DOAC therapy and periodically
during follow-up is critical [37]. Dabigatran is eliminated by
the kidney primarily unchanged; therefore, its plasma concentration is elevated in patients with moderately impaired renal
function [38]. Rivaroxaban and apixaban should be used with
caution in patients with renal impairment and are not recommended in patients with impaired renal function
(CrCl≤15 mL/min) [39, 40]. Our results indicate that the risk
of hemorrhage continuously increased from younger to older
age groups and that the risk of stroke was particularly significant in patients older than 65 years (52.57%).
One interesting finding was that the rate of antithrombotic
drug-related hemorrhagic events in males (44.62%) was comparable to that in females (41.14%), which may suggest that
the female sex may not be a risk factor for ischemic stroke in
this particular patient population. The 2017 AF guideline published by the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) and the
European Heart Rhythm Association (EHRA) recommended
that DOACs should be prescribed for all patients with AF,
except for those with a CHA2DS2-VASc score of 0 (males)
or 1 (females) [41].
Although clinical trials are mandatory to establish efficacy
for novel drugs, there are limitations on the ability to draw
definitive conclusions about drug safety due to the strict study
entry criteria, relatively small sample size, finite scope and
time frame. Nevertheless, spontaneous reporting systems
(SRSs) can serve as a primary source of postmarketing data
and play an important role in the detection of safety issues,
including antithrombotic drug-related hemorrhage. Using
pharmacovigilance analysis, all new oral anticoagulants were
found to be associated with hemorrhage, and therefore this
appears to be a class effect. In our study, we found that the
risk of hemorrhage induced by rivaroxaban (N = 42,381,
20.84%) monotherapy was much higher than that induced
by the other drug groups. This finding broadly supports the
work of other studies in this area [42]. The result may be
because rivaroxaban came to market earlier than other new
oral anticoagulants and was the most prescribed. Betrixaban
seemed to have the strongest association with hemorrhage
among all antithrombotic drug monotherapies (ROR,
829.95; 95% CI, 113.61-6063.15), which has not been

Cardiovasc Drugs Ther

reported previously. Although the frequency of intracranial
and fatal bleeding was lower in the edoxaban group, there
was no significant difference in the risk of hemorrhage compared to that in the other groups.
To further investigate differences in the severity of antithrombotic regimen-related hemorrhage, the rate of fatality
due to hemorrhage following various antithrombotic regimens
was assessed. It was observed that hemorrhage generally led
to poor outcomes, with approximately half of cases (51.11%)
resulting in death. With respect to monotherapy, dabigatran
etexilate appeared to present a relatively high risk of death,
with 4711 (27.33%) deaths among 19,317 cases, while
rivaroxaban appeared to have a relatively low risk of death,
with 7370 (17.74%) deaths among 47,081 cases. However, it
was difficult to accurately determine the risk of death due to
the use of betrixaban monotherapy because only two available
reports were collected for each regimen, and continued surveillance is needed. The risk of fatality was higher in patients
who developed hemorrhage after receiving edoxaban plus
clopidogrel combination therapy than in those who received
edoxaban monotherapy (21.74% vs 24.69%, p = 0.5186).
However, as shown in Fig. 1, these results may suggest that
combined treatment with some anticoagulants and clopidogrel
does not enhance the risk of hemorrhagic fatality. In some
cases, the rate could be slightly lower for the combination than
for the DOAC alone.
Another important finding was that long-term
anticoagulation treatment with either thrombin (dabigatran
etexilate) or factor Xa (rivaroxaban and edoxaban) enzymes
resulted in a hemorrhage rate in the real-world analysis of
26.67–44.59% at 1 month. Overall, the risk of hemorrhage
decreased over time, and the average time to onset of antithrombotic drug-related hemorrhage was 282.73 days after
the initiation of anticoagulation treatment. However, at
12 months, the risk of hemorrhage was increased in the
clopidogrel monotherapy group. Surprisingly, the risk of hemorrhage in the oral apixaban plus clopidogrel group in this
study was increased at 6 months. These results, which differ
from Vos et al.’s [43] estimate of a shorter treatment duration,
could be considered beneficial due to the lower risk of bleeding events.
Although the data mining techniques used in this study
have many advantages, it should be noted that this method
cannot solve all the problems with the detection and analysis of adverse drug reaction signs based on SRSs.
Therefore, unavoidably, this study has certain limitations.
First, data mining technology cannot remedy the inherent
limitations of SRSs, such as underreporting, false
reporting, incomplete reporting, inaccuracy and arbitrariness, all of which might result in reporting bias. Second,
SRSs are only used in qualitative research and cannot be
used to quantify the adverse reaction signs of antithrombotic drug-associated hemorrhage based on the total

number of adverse reactions or calculate the incidence.
Due to a lack of information in the FAERS database, it is
difficult to control other factors that affect anticoagulation,
such as dosage, indications for drug use, preexisting cardiovascular diseases, or comorbidities. For example, mitral
stenosis, mechanical prosthetic valves, stroke without AF,
and cancer might all be contributing factors in hemorrhage.
Third, although data mining techniques can provide a profile of antithrombotic drug-associated hemorrhage through
signal detection, the results are generally insufficient to
prove a causal relationship. Without knowing the total
number of prescriptions or the administered doses of each
agent, one cannot conclude which agent is most associated
with ADEs. Generally available tools to determine the anticoagulant effect (e.g., thrombin time or anti-Xa activity)
may be needed when these compounds become widely
used. Adherence might be a larger issue in the real-life
setting than in clinical trials.

Conclusions
Our analysis of the FAERS database identified signs for hemorrhage associated with various antithrombotic regimens in
real-world practice. The most important conclusion reached
in this study was that rivaroxaban showed a stronger association with hemorrhage than other antithrombotic drug monotherapies. However, combined antithrombotic regimens presented stronger associations with hemorrhage than did monotherapies. Moreover, hemorrhage associated with DOAC plus
clopidogrel treatment appeared to result in an earlier onset and
a higher fatality rate than hemorrhage associated with
clopidogrel monotherapy. Further pharmacoepidemiological
studies are required to test the hypotheses proposed by this
study. Our findings provide a foundation for further surveillance and investigation into this area.
