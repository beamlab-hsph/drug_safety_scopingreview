Abstract
Purpose: In recent years, the potential risk of cancer associated with statin use has been a focus
of much interest. However, it remains uncertain whether statin therapy is associated with cancer
risk. To examine the association between statin use and the risk of cancer, we conducted data
mining using the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Adverse Event Reporting System
(FAERS) and a large organized database of claims constructed by a database vendor (The Japan
Medical Data Center Co., Ltd, Tokyo, Japan [JMDC]).
Methods: Relevant reports in the FAERS, which included data from the first quarter of 2004
through the end of 2012, were identified and analyzed. The reporting odds ratio (ROR) was used
to detect spontaneous report signals and was calculated using the case/non-case method. Additionally, signals were detected via the information component (IC) using the IC025 metric. Furthermore, event sequence symmetry analysis (ESSA) was applied to identify the risk of cancer
following treatment with statins over the period January 2005 to July 2013.
Results: In the FAERS database analyses, significant signals for colorectal cancer and pancreatic
cancer were found for statins as a class. In the ESSA, significant associations between statin use and
colorectal cancer and pancreatic cancer were found, with adjusted sequence ratios (95% confidence intervals) of 1.20 (1.08-1.34) and 1.31 (1.13-1.53), respectively, at an interval of 48 months.
Conclusions: Multi-methodological approaches using different algorithms and databases suggest
that statin use is associated with an increased risk for colorectal cancer and pancreatic cancer.
Key words: statin use, cancer risk, FAERS database

Introduction
HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) are
highly effective treatments for the primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular diseases [1, 2].
Statin therapy was recently recommended for individuals with a wide range of cardiovascular risk factors, including those with average and below-average
lipid levels [3]. Despite widespread and long-term use
of statins, there is still a long-standing debate concerning their association with cancer at various sites.

Overall, statin-associated cancer risk is of major concern in clinical practice.
There are many conflicting reports concerning
the association between statin use and the risk of
cancer. First, several preclinical studies have suggested that statins may have potential anticancer effects through the arrest of cell cycle progression [4],
induction of apoptosis [5, 6], suppression of angiogenesis [7, 8], and inhibition of tumor growth and

metastasis [9, 10]. An experimental study found that
statin therapy may be chemopreventive [11]. In contrast, other evidence suggests that statins may be carcinogenic [12]. Likewise, a number of clinical trials
and epidemiologic studies have investigated the association between statin use and cancer risk [13-32].
These studies have reported inconsistent findings,
with some studies reporting a reduced risk, some describing an increased risk, and others failing to identify any effect. Therefore, it remains uncertain
whether statin therapy is associated with cancer risk.
Recently, data mining with different methodologies and algorithms has been applied to identify
safety signals within medical databases, including
spontaneous adverse drug reaction databases, claims
databases, and prescriptions databases. To examine
the association of statin use and the risks of common
cancers, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS), a large
and useful spontaneous database of adverse event
reports, was analyzed. In addition, a large,
well-organized claims database constructed by a database vendor (The Japan Medical Data Center Co.,
Ltd, Tokyo, Japan [JMDC]) was also analyzed. Our
study aimed to examine the hypothesis that statin use
is associated with cancer risk by employing different
methodologies, algorithms, and databases.

Materials and Methods
FAERS data
Data source
The FAERS is a computerized information database designed to support the FDA’s post-marketing
safety surveillance program for all approved drugs
and therapeutic biological products. The system contains all reports of adverse events reported spontaneously by health care professionals, manufacturers,
and consumers worldwide. The FAERS consists of
seven data sets that include patient demographic and
administrative information (file descriptor DEMO),
drug and biologic information (DRUG), adverse
events (REAC), patient outcomes (OUTC), report
sources (RPSR), start of drug therapy and end dates
(THER), and indications for use/diagnosis (INDI). A
unique number for identifying a FAERS report allows
all of the information from different files to be linked.
The raw data of the FAERS database can be downloaded
freely
from
the
FDA
website
(http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/InformationOnDrugs/
ucm135151.htm). The structure of the FAERS database
is described elsewhere [33].
This study included data from the first quarter of
2004 through the end of 2012. A total of 4,052,885 reports were obtained. Reports with a common CASE

224
number were identified as duplicate reports. We deleted all duplicates and excluded them from the
analyses. Finally, a total of 54,841,322 drug-reaction
pairs were identified among 3,308,116 reports. The
Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities
(MedDRA® version 17.0) preferred terms (PTs) was
used to classify the adverse events.

Identifying statins and cancers
The FAERS permits the registration of arbitrary
drug names including trade names, generic names,
and abbreviations. All drug names were extracted
from the DRUG file of the FAERS and recorded. A
drug name archive that included the name of all
preparations, generic names, and synonyms of drugs
marketed in the world was created using the Martindale
website
(https://www.medicinescomplete.
com/mc/login.htm).
Simvastatin,
rosuvastatin,
atorvastatin, fluvastatin, pitavastatin, pravastatin, and
lovastatin were identified by linking this archive with
the FAERS database. All records including statins in
the DRUG files were selected, and the relevant reactions from the REACTION files were then identified.
Adverse events in the FAERS database are coded
using the MedDRA® PTs, which are grouped by defined medical conditions or areas of interest. We
identified PTs related to cancer using the Standardized MedDRA® Queries (SMQ). PTs related to the 9
cancers (colorectal cancer, lung cancer, pancreatic
cancer, gastric cancer, esophageal cancer, breast cancer, hemotological malignancies, melanoma, and
prostate cancer) were identified in the SMQ category
of malignant tumors.

Data mining (Disproportional analysis)
The reporting odds ratio (ROR) and the information component (IC) were utilized to detect spontaneous report signals. Signal scores were calculated
using a case/non-case method [34, 35]. ROR and IC
are widely used algorithms and have been employed
by the Netherlands Pharmacovigilance Centre and the
World Health Organization (WHO), respectively [36,
37]. Cases were defined as reports containing the
event of interest (ie, cancers); all other reports comprised the non-cases.
Applying these algorithms and using a
two-by-two table of frequency counts, we calculated
signal scores to assess whether or not a drug was significantly associated with an adverse event. However,
these calculations or algorithms, so-called disproportionality analyses or measures, differ from one another in that the ROR is frequentist (non-Bayesian),
whereas the IC is Bayesian. For the ROR, a signal is
detected if the lower limit of 95% two-sided confidence interval (95% CI) is >1 [36]. Signal detection
http://www.medsci.org

Int. J. Med. Sci. 2015, Vol. 12
using the IC is performed using the IC025 metric, a
lower limit of the 95% two-sided CI of the IC. In this
method, a signal is detected if the IC025 value exceeds
0 [37]. In the current study, two methods were used to
detect signals, and the adverse events were listed as
drug-associated when the two indices met the criteria
outlined above. Data management and analyses were
performed using Visual Mining Studio software (version 8.0; Mathematical Systems, Inc. Tokyo, Japan).

Claims data
Date source
A large and chronologically organized claims
database was employed, which was constructed by
the JMDC using standardized disease classifications
and anonymous record linkage [38]. In total, this database included about 1.2 million insured persons
(approximately 1% of the population), comprised
mainly of company employees and their family
members. The JMDC claims database contained
monthly claims from medical institutions and pharmacies submitted during the period from January
2005 to July 2013. The database provided information
on the beneficiaries, including encrypted personal
identifiers, age, sex, International Classification of
Diseases, 10th revision (ICD-10) procedure and diagnostic codes, as well as the name, dose, and number of
days’ supplied for prescribed and/or dispensed
drugs. All drugs were coded according to the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classification of
the European Pharmaceutical Market Research Association (EphMRA). An encrypted personal identifier
was used to link claims data from different hospitals,
clinics, and pharmacies. For the event sequence
symmetry analysis (ESSA), we utilized cases extracted
from the JMDC claims database for which statins were
prescribed at least once during the study period and
the patient was diagnosed with cancer.
This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Kinki University School of Pharmacy. All
researchers signed a written agreement declaring that
they had no intention of attempting to obtain information from JMDC that could potentially violate the
privacy of patients or care providers. In the JMDC
claims database, all personal data (name and identification number) were replaced by a univocal numerical code, making the database anonymous at the
source. Therefore, there was no need to obtain informed consent in the study.

Definition of statins and cancers
Six available statins (simvastatin, rosuvastatin,
atorvastatin, fluvastatin, pitavastatin, and pravastatin) were analyzed. There were no data for lovastatin in this claims database. The ICD-10 codes of C18

225
(Malignant neoplasm of colon), C19 (Malignant neoplasm of rectosigmoid junction) and C20 (Malignant
neoplasm of rectum) were selected as colorectal cancer. In addition, the ICD-10 codes of C34 (Malignant
neoplasm of bronchus and lung), C25 (Malignant
neoplasm of pancreas), C16 (Malignant neoplasm of
stomach), C15 (Malignant neoplasm of esophagus),
C50 (Malignant neoplasm of breast), C81-96 (Malignant neoplasms, stated or presumed to be primary, of
lymphoid, hematopoietic and related tissue), C43
(Malignant melanoma of skin), and C61 (Malignant
neoplasm of prostate) were selected as lung cancer,
pancreatic cancer, gastric cancer, esophageal cancer,
breast cancer, hematological malignancies, melanoma,
and prostate cancer, respectively.

Data mining (Symmetry analysis)
Event sequence symmetry analysis (ESSA) was
performed to test the hypothesis that statins increase
the risk for cancer. The ESSA method has been described in detail in several published studies investigating the associations between the use of certain
target drugs and potential adverse events [39, 40].
Briefly, the ESSA evaluates asymmetry in the distribution of an incident event before and after the initiation of a specific treatment. Asymmetry may indicate
an association between the specific treatment of interest and the event. In this study, the association
between statin use and diagnosis of cancer was analyzed.
The crude sequence ratio (SR) was defined as the
ratio of the number of patients newly diagnosed with
cancer after the initiation of statins versus the number
of patients newly diagnosed with cancer before the
initiation of statins. A SR >1 signified an association
between statin use and an increased risk of cancer.
The SR is sensitive to prescribing or event trends over
time. Therefore, the SRs were adjusted for temporal
trends in statins and events using the method proposed by Hallas [39]. The probability for the statins to
be prescribed first, in the absence of any causal relationship, can be estimated in a so-called null-effect SR
[39]. The null-effect SR produced by the proposed
model may be interpreted as a reference value for the
SR. Therefore, the null-effect SR is the expected SR in
the absence of any causal association, after accounting
for the incidence trends. By dividing the crude SR by
the null-effect SR, an adjusted SR (ASR) can be obtained that is corrected for temporal trends. A slightly
modified model was used to account for the limited
time interval allowed between statin use and the diagnosis of cancer [40].
All incident users of statins and all cases newly
diagnosed with cancer were identified during the
period from January 2005 to July 2013. For this study,
http://www.medsci.org

Int. J. Med. Sci. 2015, Vol. 12

226

patients included in the database were followed up to
July 2013; therefore, different patients had different
follow-up periods. Incidence was defined as the first
prescription for statins. To exclude prevalent users of
statins, the analysis was restricted to users who presented their first prescription on July 2005 or later
(after a run-in period of 6 months). Likewise, the
analysis was restricted to cases who presented their
first diagnosis on July 2005 or later. To ensure that our
analysis was restricted to incident users of statins and
cases newly diagnosed with cancer, we also carried
out a waiting time distribution analysis [41]. An identical run-in period was also applied to patients enrolled into the cohort after June 2005. Incident users
were identified by excluding those patients who had
received their first prescription for statins before July
2005, and cases newly diagnosed with cancer were
identified by excluding those patients who had a first
diagnosis of cancer before July 2005. All patients who
initiated a new treatment with statins and had a first
diagnosis within 48-month period were identified.
Patients who had received their first prescriptions for
statins and had a first diagnosis of cancer within the
same month were not included in determining the SR.
The results of the analyses were expressed as the
mean ± standard deviation (SD) for quantitative data
and as frequency (percentage) for categorical data.
Ninety-five percent confidence intervals (95% CI) for
the ASRs were calculated using a method for exact
confidence intervals for binomial distributions [42].

Results
FAERS database
A total of 8,270 PTs were found in reports for
simvastatin, 5,923 for rosuvastatin, 9,014 for atorvastatin, 3,417 for fluvastatin, 1,258 for pitavastatin, 5,815
for pravastatin, and 4,196 for lovastatin. The total

number of drug-reaction pairs for statins was
1,433,826; this included 487,237 for simvastatin,
177,763 for rosuvastatin, 556,579 for atorvastatin,
28,010 for fluvastatin, 5,424 for pitavastatin, 122,768
for pravastatin, and 56,045 for lovastatin. The number
of drug-reaction pairs was 25,951 for colorectal cancer,
62,107 for lung cancer, 15,464 for pancreatic cancer,
8,439 for gastric cancer, 4,832 for esophageal cancer,
152,541 for breast cancer, 115,714 for hematological
malignancies, 12,601 for melanoma, and 21,927 for
prostate cancer.
The statistical data on statin-associated cancers
are presented in Table 1. The signal scores suggested
that the statins were associated with colorectal cancer
(ROR: 1.29, 95% CI: 1.20-1.38; IC: 0.35, 95% CI:
0.25-0.45), pancreatic cancer (ROR: 1.35, 95% CI:
1.24-1.47; IC: 0.42, 95% CI: 0.30-0.55), and prostate
cancer (ROR: 1.25, 95% CI: 1.17-1.34; IC: 0.31; 95% CI;
0.21-0.42). The signal scores of breast cancer (ROR:
0.48, 95% CI: 0.46-0.51; IC: -1.03, 95% CI: -1.10 to -0.96)
and hematological malignancies (ROR: 0.52, 95% CI:
0.49-0.54; IC: -0.93, 95% CI: -1.00 to -0.85) showed an
inverse association with statins. In the analysis of individual statins, simvastatin showed significant signals for pancreatic cancer, rosuvastatin for pancreatic
cancer and prostate cancer, atorvastatin for colorectal
cancer, lung cancer, pancreatic cancer, and prostate
cancer, pitavastatin for lung cancer, gastric cancer,
and prostate cancer, and lovastatin for prostate cancer. Meanwhile, significant inverse signals were
found for lung cancer with simvastatin and lovastatin,
for gastric cancer with simvastatin, for breast cancer
with simvastatin, rosuvastatin, atorvastatin, fluvastatin, pitavastatin, pravastatin, and lovastatin, for
hematological malignancies with simvastatin, rosuvastatin, atorvastatin, fluvastatin, pravastatin, and
lovastatin, and for prostate cancer with pravastatin.

JMDC claims database
The ESSA characteristics of the study population
are summarized in Table 2. The numbers of claims
including statins during the study period was
1,624,438. Among the 95,941 statin users, 38,402 incident users were identified. The mean age of statin
incident users was 51.8±10.4 years. Table 3 shows the
associations between statin use and the risk of cancer.
Of the 38,402 incident statin users, 1,575 were identified as incident persons with a diagnosis of colorectal
cancer, 818 with lung cancer, 804 with pancreatic
cancer, 1,333 with gastric cancer, 125 with esophageal
cancer, 373 with hematological malignancies, and 34
with melanoma, before or after the initiation of
statins. Of the 15,694 female users and 22,708 male
users of statins, 485 and 522 were identified as incident person with a diagnosis of breast cancer and
prostate cancer before or after the initiation of statins,
respectively. Statin use and the diagnoses of colorectal
cancer, lung cancer, and pancreatic cancer were significantly associated with ASRs of 1.20 (95% CI:
1.08–1.34), 1.32 (1.13–1.53), and 1.31 (1.13–1.53), respectively. Statin use was inversely associated with
the diagnosis of breast cancer, with an ASR of 0.81
(0.66–0.98). Analyses of the gastric cancer, esophageal
cancer, hematological malignancies, prostate cancer,
and melanoma showed no significant association. In

the analyses of individual statins, significant associations were found for colorectal cancer with atorvastatin (1.33, 1.12–1.57), and pitavastatin (1.32,
1.06–1.65), for lung cancer with rosuvastatin (3.46,
2.80–4.28) and atorvastatin (1.28, 1.01–1.64), and for
pancreatic cancer with atorvastatin (1.47, 1.14–1.90).
Inverse associations were found for gastric cancer
with simvastatin (0.51, 0.29–0.87), for breast cancer
with simvastatin (0.25, 0.06–0.83) and rosuvastatin
(0.74, 0.56–0.99), and for hematological malignancies
with pravastatin (0.61, 0.38–0.97).

Discussion
Significant signals for colorectal cancer and
pancreatic cancer were found for statins as a class in
analyses of both the FAERS database and the JMDC
claims database. Consistent findings from the independent analyses using different methodologies, algorithms, and databases suggest that statin use is associated with the risk of these two cancers. For lung
cancer, a significant association was found with
statins as a class in the analysis of the JMDC claims
database, but not in the analysis of the FAERS database. In the analyses of individual statins, significant
associations with lung cancer were found for
atorvastatin and pitavastatin in the analysis of the
FAERS database, and were found for rosuvastatin and
atorvastatin in the analysis of the JMDC claims database. These findings may suggest that high potency
statins including atorvastatin, rosuvastatin, and
pitavastatin are associated with an increased risk of
lung cancer.
For gastric cancer, no significant association was
found for statins as a class. In the analyses of individual statins, significant associations were found for
pitavastatin in the analysis of the FAERS database.
However, simvastatin was inversely associated with
gastric cancer in analyses of the FAERS database and
the JMDC claims database. Overall, the association
between statin use and gastric cancer is unclear. Given
the contradictory findings, it may be reasonable that
different statins are associated with different risks of
gastric cancer.
For prostate cancer, a significant association was
found for statins as a class in the analysis of the
FAERS database, but not in the analysis of the JMDC
claims database. In the analyses of individual statins,
significant associations with prostate cancer were
found for rosuvastatin, atorvastatin, pitavastatin and
lovastatin in the analysis of the FAERS database, but
not in the analysis of the JMDC claims database.
Overall, the association between statin use and prostate cancer is unclear; however, high potency statins
including rosuvastatin, atorvastatin, and pitavastatin
should be noted and monitored in the future.
Of note, inverse associations of statin use were
found for breast cancer and hematological malignancies. Statins as a class and individual statins were inversely associated with breast cancer in the analysis of
the FAERS database and the JMDC claims database.
There is debate concerning the association of statins
with breast cancer. However, some studies reported
that statins were associated with a decreased risk of
breast cancer [43-45]. This accumulated evidence, including our study, supports the hypothesis that statin
use may be associated with a decreased risk of breast

230
cancer. In addition, statins were inversely associated
with hematological malignancies in the analysis of the
FAERS database. A series of nested case-control
studies performed by Vinogradova et al. in 2011 suggested that prolonged use of statins was associated
with a reduced risk of hematological malignancies
[19]. Some experimental studies have suggested that
statins may have chemopreventive potential against
hematopoietic malignancies [46-48]. These findings
support the hypothesis that statins may have a protective effect against the development of breast cancer
and hematological malignancies. Further studies are
needed to confirm these hypotheses. There was no
significant association of statin use with esophageal
cancer and melanoma in analyses of the FAERS database and JMDC claims database, suggesting that
statins have no positive or negative effects on these
cancers.
Although a plausible pharmacological mechanism for statin-associated cancer is unknown, there
are several noteworthy potential explanations. The
relationship between serum cholesterol levels and the
risk of cancer is an area of considerable research and
debate. The literature on cholesterol and cancer has
demonstrated an inverse relationship between total
serum cholesterol levels and incident cancer [49].
There are a number of studies suggesting that an excessively low level of total cholesterol might be an
increased risk for cancer mortality [50-55]. Recently,
some studies have reported that lower levels of
LDL-C are associated with higher rates of incident
cancers [56]. Kikuchi et al. suggested that lower serum
levels of total cholesterol are associated with higher
oxidative DNA damage and linking to an increased
risk of cancer [50]. Oxidative DNA stress is thought to
play a major role in carcinogenesis [57]. As our study
did not examine serum levels of cholesterol, the association of the cholesterol level with cancer risk is unknown. However, it was noteworthy that significant
associations with increased risks of cancers were
predominantly found for high potency statins such as
atorvastatin, rosuvastatin, and pitavastatin. Treatment with high potency statins may result in a lower
level of cholesterol than other statin therapy.
Statins increase the number of regulatory T cells
(Tregs) [58]. This effect might impair both the innate
[59] and adaptive [60] host antitumour immune responses. The number of Tregs present in many solid
tumors correlates inversely with patient survival [61].
The elderly are relatively immunosuppressed and are
more likely to have occult cancers [62]. Therefore, it is
highly plausible that the elderly are particularly sensitive to a statin-induced increase in Tregs, further
impairing their immune response to cancer. Some
statin trials revealed that statin therapy of the specific
http://www.medsci.org

Int. J. Med. Sci. 2015, Vol. 12
populations including the elderly was associated with
an increased risk for the development of incident
cancer [63-65]. Given these findings, it is reasonable to
assume that statin-induced impairment of the immune response may play an important role in the
development of cancer.
The analysis of spontaneous reports is a useful
method for identifying signals, and the FAERS database is considered a large source of these data. However, there are several potential limitations that
should be taken into account when interpreting results obtained from the FAERS database [66]. First,
there is no certainty that the reported event (adverse
event or medication error) was actually due to the
drug. Second, the FDA does not receive reports on
every adverse event or medication error that occurs
with a product. Third, the database has missing data
and also frequent misspelling of drug names. Fourth,
there are a number of duplicate entries in the database. To overcome problems with data quality, we
deleted duplicates. Fifth, slightly increased ROR and
IC values do not imply an unmistakable risk of cancer
in clinical practice. These data mining algorithms and
criteria may be helpful to provide further information
on the adverse event, and many studies in this area
have been reported [67-71]. However, no individual
algorithm to detect signals is adequate, and the concurrent use of other algorithms is essential. Therefore,
the ROR and IC algorithms were used in the analysis
of FAERS database, and our study detected weak but
reliable signals for colorectal and pancreatic cancer.
Furthermore, in the current study, a different methodology, the ESSA of the JMDC claims database, was
used to confirm the findings of FAERS database
analyses. Of course, the ESSA is associated with several potential limitations due to its use of a claims
database. First, our study population was selected
from beneficiaries covered by the employees’ health
insurance system. Because most beneficiaries are
working adults or their family members, the proportion of elderly patients aged ≥65 years is low. This
may make it difficult to detect cancer risk in an analysis of the JMDC claims database. Second, the diagnoses listed in the claims were not validated. We
generally needed to consider the diagnosis contained
in the claim, which is listed for health insurance
claims. However, it is obvious that serious diseases
such as cancer may not be listed in the claim only for
health insurance claims. In the present study, individual cases were not reviewed, and other causes
were not considered. Finally, potential confounding
factors, including smoking history, health history,
race/ethnicity, body mass index and occupation,
which are associated with cancer, could not be controlled in this study. Lack of data on these potential

231
confounding factors should be considered as a limitation when interpreting our findings. Although these
potential limitations should be taken into account
when interpreting results obtained from the study, it
is noteworthy that the multi-methodological approaches using different algorithms and databases
detected significant signals for cancer.

Conclusions
Multi-methodological approaches using different methodologies, algorithms, and databases suggest
that statin use is associated with an increased risk for
colorectal and pancreatic cancer. Although there are
many conflicting reports concerning the association
between statin use and the risk of these cancers, our
study definitely demonstrated this association. An
association of lung cancer, gastric cancer, and prostate
cancer with statin use is uncertain, because different
statins are associated with different risks of these
cancers. Of note, significantly increased risks of cancers were found predominantly for high potency
statins, such as atorvastatin, rosuvastatin and
pitavastatin. Further studies are needed to confirm
our findings and elucidate the mechanism for
statin-induced cancers.
