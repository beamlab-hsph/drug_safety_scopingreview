SUMMARY
Purpose Five data mining methodologies for detecting a possible signal from spontaneous reports on adverse drug reactions (ADRs) were compared.
Methods The five methodologies, the Bayesian method using the Gamma Poissson Shrinker (GPS), the method employed
in the UK Medicines Control Agency (MCA), the Bayesian Confidence Propagation Neural Network (BCPNN), the method
using the 95% confidence interval (CI) for the reporting odds ratio (RORCI) and that using the 95% CI of the proportional
reporting ratio (PRRCI) were compared using Japanese data obtained between 1998 and 2000.
Results There were all in all 38 731 drug–ADR combinations. The count of drug–ADR pairs was equal to 1 or 2 for 31 230
combinations and none of them were identified as a possible signal with the MCA or BCPNN. Similarly, the GPS detected a
possible signal in none of the combinations where the count was equal to 1 but in 7.5% of the combinations where the count
was equal to 2. The RORCI and PRRCI detected a possible signal in more than half of the combinations where the count was
equal to 1 or 2. When the pairwise agreement on whether or not a drug–ADR combination satisfied the criteria for a possible
signal was assessed for the 38 731 combinations, the concordance measure kappa was greater than 0.9 between the MCA and
BCPNN and between the RORCI and PRRCI. Kappa was around 0.6 between the GPS and MCA and between the GPS and
BCPNN. Otherwise, kappa was smaller than 0.2.
Conclusions The drug–ADR combinations detected as a possible signal vary between different methodologies. Copyright

tion being previously unknown or incompletely documented’.1 To detect a possible safety signal from
spontaneous reports on suspected adverse drug reactions (ADRs), the method of data mining has been
employed since the late 1990s although the original
idea was presented much earlier.2 Interestingly, several data mining methods have been developed almost
simultaneously but independently of one another in
some of the major national centres and WHO Uppsala
Monitoring Centre (UMC).
The data mining methodology to find possible
signals from spontaneous reports has aided the
evaluation of case series inside the national centre or
WHO UMC where ADR reports are collected and

assessed. However, the application of methods to find
possible signals from ADR reports seems to be
expanding. For instance, a large international drug
company may use the method to detect a possible
signal from its own large database for ADR reports. A
greater understanding of how ADR’s are detected is
also important for smaller pharmaceutical companies,
because increasingly the proportional reporting ratio
(PRR) and other measures used as the signalling
criteria in some data mining methodologies are
regarded as a requisite component of the safety
information provided by the national centre or WHO
UMC. The method may also be useful for scientists
who may use the method to detect a signal from their
own databases3 or who address the safety problems by
the epidemiological methods.4
None of the proposed methodologies is likely to
prove ideal. Therefore, a comparison of the pattern of
possible signals found by different signalling methodologies would be useful. In this study, we compare
the following five methodologies; (i) the Gamma
Poissson Shrinker (GPS) program;5–8 (ii) the method
employed by the UK Medicines Control Agency
(MCA) using the PRR and chi-squared (also abbreviated as ‘MCA’ in this study);9 (iii) the Bayesian
Confidence Propagation Neural Network (BCPNN) in
the WHO UMC;10,11 (iv) the method using the 95%
confidence interval (CI) for the reporting odds ratio
(ROR) in the Netherlands Pharmacovigilance Foundation Lareb12–14 (designated as ‘RORCI’ in this article);
and (v) the method using the 95%CI of PRR
(designated as ‘PRRCI’).14 It may be noted that the
GPS is the prototype of the multi-item GPS (MGPS)
currently used in the US Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) and both the GPS and MGPS are sometimes
mentioned as the ‘Empirical Bayes Screening’.8,15
The basic idea behind all of the five data mining
methodologies examined in this study is similar. In the
GPS the baseline (independence) frequencies or
expected counts of reports for the specific drug–
ADR combination are estimated by assuming that
these two variables are independent. The expected
count is compared with the observed count of reports
on a particular drug–ADR combination where the
observed count is assumed to be a draw from a Poisson
distribution.5 In the BCPNN, the overall probability
(prior probability) that a specific ADR is expected to be
on a report is compared with the conditional probability (posterior probability) of that particular ADR
being present given the information that a specific drug
is actually listed on it.10,11 Recently, Gould16 described
the BCPNN and GPS in common terms as two
Bayesian methods and showed that the information
Copyright # 2004 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

component (IC) used in the BCPNN can be expressed
as the logarithm to the base 2 of the ratio of the
observed to expected counts of reports. The same logic
also applies to the PRR used in the signalling criteria
for the MCA and PRRCI and the ROR used in the
RORCI where the expected ratio and odds, respectively, for a specific ADR is estimated using all of the
available information (excluding that for the drug
under investigation) and then compared with the
observed ratio and odds for the drug of interest.9,12–14
Despite these similarities, the combinations illuminated as a possible signal in one method may differ
from those by another method. In 2002, van Puijenbroek et al.14 published an article where their method
(RORCI) is compared with the BCPNN and several
other methods. However, the GPS, one of the major
methods developed by the U.S. FDA,5–8 is not
evaluated in the article. Similarly, the MCA, another
major method is also not included in the comparison,
although the relevant method using the 95%CI for the
PRRCI was evaluated.14
In this study, possible signals detected by the five
data mining methods including the BCPNN, GPS and
MCA are evaluated. To evaluate the pairwise agreement between methods, we used the concordance
measure kappa.17 Japanese ADR data which are
available on the Worldwide Web and can be accessed
by researchers outside the national centre were used as
an example.
METHODS
Japanese ADR reports used in this article were kindly
provided by the Safety Division, Ministry of Health,
Labour and Welfare (MHLW) in December 2001. They
are essentially the same as those open to the public on
the Web site (http://www.pharmasys.gr.jp/) at that time
and give the list for the counts of reports on various
drug–ADR combinations sent to the Japanese spontaneous reporting system (SRS) in each year between
1998 and 2000. In the list, ADR terms are given as a preferred term (PT) of the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Affairs (MedDRA) Version 4.0. For a few selected
cases, the detailed information such as age, gender and
clinical course is available on the Web. However, for the
majority of cases, the information is available only on
the drug name, ADR, counts of drug–ADR pairs and
year of the report. In the available data, one primary suspected drug is assigned to each ADR. If one report
includes two ADRs that occurred in one patient, they
are shown as two separate drug–ADR pairs in the list.
There is no way of identifying which two drug–ADR
pairs are reported for one patient from the available data.

comparison of data mining methodologies
The data include a total count of 109 207 drug–ADR
pairs on one of 38 731 drug–ADR combinations of
1461 drugs and 1668 PTs (ADRs). The average count
of drug–ADR pairs per one drug–ADR combination
is 2.8.
Five data mining methods, the GPS, MCA, BCPNN,
RORCI and PRRCI were compared with one another.
The FDA previously used the GPS that was the method
to analyse large sparse two-dimensional tables. The
FDA, however, currently uses the MGPS which has
been developed by extending the GPS to compute
signal scores for pairs and higher-order combinations
of drugs and ADRs (e.g. triplets such as two drugs plus
an ADR, or a quadruplet such as a drug plus three
ADRs).7,8 We have chosen to use the GPS program in
this study because of several reasons. First, the GPS
program is available in the public domain (ftp://
ftp.research.att.com/dist/gps/accessed 2004 January).
In addition, some of the other methods such as the
BCPNN and MCA do not, at least in the current form,
handle the higher-order drug–ADR combinations.
When the data of drug–event pairs are analysed by
MGPS the results are similar to, though not exactly the
same as, those analysed by GPS (DuMouchel, personal
communication). In GPS the baseline (independence)
frequencies are calculated assuming that the drug–
event combinations are independent whereas the
method in MGPS focuses on the total number of
reports, not the total number of combinations
(DuMouchel, personal communication). The MGPS
cannot be applied to the data used in this study since
there is no means of knowing which two drug–ADR
pairs are reported for one patient. When the GPS was
used, the data were classified into three strata divided
according to the year of report (i.e. one of 1998, 1999
and 2000) and the five parameter values characterising
the model were estimated by using GPS.exe. We used
the 5-parameter model rather than the 3-parameter
model both of which are available in GPS.exe because
the use of the former model is recommended except
when this model did not converge in a document
attached to GPS.exe. Using GPS.exe, we calculated the
baseline frequencies or expected counts of pairs for
each of the drug–ADR combinations (E), relative
report ratio (RR) defined as RR ¼ N/E where N is the
count of observed drug–ADR pairs, and EBGM which
may be interpreted as the value ‘shrunk’ from RR.
Using the estimates of a1, a2, b1, b2 and P in the 5parameter model, the values of EB05 (signal score), i.e.
the lower 1-sided 95% confidence limit of EBGM,7
which was introduced for the first time by DuMouchel
and Pregibon8 were calculated for each drug–ADR
combination. The criterion EB05 > 2 was used to

detect a possible signal. The stratification was used
only for the GPS but not for other methods. This is
because the user of the GPS program is always
requested to specify the strata to run the program
while the specification of the strata is not, at least
explicitly, requested when other methods are used.
The values for the IC and its variance used in the
BCPNN in the WHO UMC were calculated according
to Orre et al.11 The criterion IC-2SD > 0 was used to
detect a possible signal. The calculation for IC should
ideally use the number or reports as the denominator,
i.e. ‘C’ defined as ‘the total number of reports in the
database’ in the article by Bate et al.,10 rather than the
total count of drug–ADR pairs. However, we used the
latter because the total number of reports was not
available in this study.
The method of the MCA uses the criteria consisting
of (i) PRR  2, (ii) a  3 (a is the count of pairs of the
drug–ADR combination, Figure 1) and (iii) 2  4 to
detect a possible signal.9
The method of the RORCI employed in the
Netherlands Pharmacovigilance Foundation Lareb
uses the criterion of ROR-1.96SE > 1.12–14 In addition, the method of PRRCI using the criterion of PRR1.96SE > 1 shown in the article by van Puijenbroek
et al.14 is also evaluated in this study.
For many drug–ADR combinations, the count of
reported drug–ADR pairs is small. For example, of the
38 731 drug–ADR combinations obtained in the
Japanese SRS between 1998 and 2000, the count of
pairs of the drug–ADR combination (‘a’ in Figure 1) is
equal to 1 for 25 106 (65%) combinations and 2 for
6214 (16%) combinations. It is generally agreed that
more than a single report is required to generate a
signal.1 In the method of the MCA, the criterion ‘a’  3
is included explicitly as one of the signalling criteria to
detect a possible signal.9 To address the problems
associated with the small counts of drug–ADR pairs,
the fraction of drug–ADR combinations satisfying the
signalling criterion is estimated by dividing the data
into subgroups where ‘a’ (Figure 1) is equal to 1, 2, 3, 4,

5 and more than 5. For some methods, a signalling
criterion cannot be calculated for certain drug–ADR
combinations. For example, it is impossible to estimate
the PRR and its standard error (SE), when b ¼ 0
(Figure 1) or when no other ADRs are reported for that
drug in question. Similarly, SE of the ROR cannot be
calculated if one of the values for ‘b’, ‘c’ and ‘d’ in
Figure 1 is zero (see Appendix of the article by van
Puijenbroek et al.14 for the formulas for those
quantities).
To evaluate the pairwise agreement between the
five methods, the concordance measure kappa,
proportionate agreement for positive rating (Ppos) and
proportionate agreement for negative rating (Pneg) are
estimated. The concordance measure kappa forms a
ratio that adjusts the observed proportion of agreement
(Po) for what might be expected from chance alone (Pe)
and is defined as:17
kappa ¼ ðPo  Pe Þ=ð1  Pe Þ
where Po and Pe are defined using symbols in Figure 2
as:

Po ¼ Nyy þ Nnn =N::


Pe ¼ Ny :=N:: N:y =N:: þ ðNn :=N::ÞðN:n =N::Þ
Kappa ranges between 1 and 1; when the observed
agreement is perfect or Po ¼ 1 then kappa ¼ 1, when
the observed agreement is the same as that expected
or Po ¼ Pe then kappa ¼ 0, and when Nyy ¼ Nnn ¼ 0
and Nyn ¼ Nny ¼ N../2 then kappa ¼ 1.
The other two measures are defined, respectively, as:

Ppos ¼ 2Nyy = Ny : þ N:y
and
Pneg ¼ 2Nnn =ðNn : þ N:n Þ:
Those quantities were employed because no single
method is considered to be a ‘gold-standard’ and the
use of kappa, Ppos and Pneg in combination may be

preferable in this case.17 This evaluation was performed based on all 38 731 drug–ADR combinations.
Combinations for which a certain signalling criterion
could not be evaluated (i.e. when b ¼ 0 for the MCA
and PRRCI, and when b ¼ 0, c ¼ 0 or d ¼ 0 for the
RORCI) were considered as non-signals with that
criterion.
In the article by van Puijenbroek et al.,14 sensitivity,
specificity, positive and negative predictive value were
evaluated using the BCPNN as a comparator because
the BCPNN was tested for performance for signal
determination against standard literature source on a
retrospective basis.18 In this article, we evaluated the
agreement between the BCPNN and GPS and that
between the BCPNN and MCA using these measures to
conform with those of van Puijenbroek et al.,14 though
none of the signalling criteria is generally considered to
be superior to the others. According to van Puijenbroek
et al.,14 in the evaluation of these measures, the
combinations are excluded when the signalling
criterion cannot be calculated.
For the GPS, the data presented in this article are
those obtained with stratification unless otherwise
specified. However, to evaluate the effect of stratification in the GPS, possible signals found by the method
and relevant measures were also estimated without
stratification (i.e. by assuming that all the reports were
in a single stratum). Where appropriate, the data with
and without stratification were compared using the
McNemar test and Wilcoxon signed-ranks test.
RESULTS
Table 1 shows the fraction of the drug–ADR combinations for which the signalling criteria are satisfied.
The drug–ADR combinations are divided into subgroups where the count of pairs of the drug–ADR
combination ‘a’ (Figure 1) is equal to 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
and more than 5. The number of combinations for
which no signalling criterion can be calculated is also
presented. With the MCA and BCPNN, no possible
signal was detected for any of a total of 31 320
(81%) drug–ADR combinations where ‘a’ is equal
to 1 or 2. For the MCA, this is simply because the condition ‘a’  3 is included in the signalling criteria. For
the BCPNN, no drug–ADR combinations satisfy the
criterion IC-2SD > 0 when ‘a’ is equal to 1 or 2.
Similarly, for the GPS, when ‘a’ is equal to 1, the maximum EB05 is 0.389 and no drug–ADR combinations
meet the criterion EB05 > 2 but a possible signal is
detected for 7.5% of 6214 combinations where ‘a’ is
equal to 2. However, for the RORCI and PRRCI,
more than half of drug–event combinations meet the

criteria ROR-1.96SE > 1 and PRR-1.96SE > 1 when
‘a’ is equal to 1 and 2.’ When ‘a’ is equal to 4 or
greater, more than half of the combinations satisfy
the signalling criteria with all of the methods except
for the GPS where less than half of the combinations
meet the criterion EB05 > 2. Another feature characterising the GPS is that the fraction of all of the 38 731
drug–ADR combinations satisfying the signalling criterion is 6.9% which is the smallest among the five
methods.
Table 2 shows the values of kappa, Ppos and Pneg
between two of the five methods. The agreement
between the RORCI and PRRCI is the highest
(kappa ¼ 0.983) followed by that between the MCA
and BCPNN (kappa ¼ 0.919). The value of kappa
between the GPS and MCA and that between the GPS
and BCPNN are around 0.6. Otherwise, the values of
kappa are less than 0.2.
Table 3 shows the sensitivity, specificity, positive and
negative predictive value evaluated using the BCPNN
as a comparator. When assessed by these measures, the
agreement of the BCPNN with RORCI (using the
criterion ROR-1.96SE > 1) and that with the PRRCI
(using the criterion PRR-1.96SE > 1) are good when

In Table 4, the possible signals detected by the GPS
and relevant measures with stratification are compared
with those without stratification. One hundred thirty
eight possible signals without stratification are not
detected as a possible signal with stratification while 50
non-signals without stratification are recognised as a
possible signal with stratification. When using the
notation in Figure 2 where Criterion A is regarded as
the GPS with stratification and Criterion B as the
GPS without stratification, Nyy ¼ 2614, Nyn ¼ 50,
Nny ¼ 138 and Nnn ¼ 35 929 and the difference
between Nyn and Nny is significant when tested by the
McNemar test (p < 0.001). The number of drug–ADR
combinations detected as a possible signal with
stratification (Ny.) is equal to 2664 and that without
stratification (N.y) is equal to 2752 and the fraction
signalled with stratification (6.9%) is smaller than that
without stratification (7.1%). The difference between
the measures such as the expected count of drug–ADR

pairs (E), the difference between the observed and
expected counts (N  E), RR, EBGM and EB05
between the datasets with and without stratification
was also statistically significant (Wilcoxon signedranks test) as shown in Table 4.
DISCUSSION
In this study, we have evaluated the agreement
between the five methods for detecting possible signals from spontaneous reports on suspected ADRs.
Four of these methodologies are developed and used
in one of the national centres and WHO UMC where
ADR reports are collected and studied. Although the
FDA now uses MGPS, we believe that the results
obtained in this study by the GPS are relevant because
the MGPS has been developed by extending GPS to
compute signal scores for higher-order combinations.8
In addition, the finding in this study that a possible

signal is detected for 6.9% of 38 731 drug–ADR combinations while the total count of drug–ADR pairs is
109 207 (Table 1) is compatible with that obtained by
the MGPS. According to Szarfman,17 the total number
of drug–ADR pairs in the FDA increased from 5000
in 1969 to 10.4 million in 2000. When the MGPS is
used, the proportion of possible signals was around
10% between 1969 and 1975, and decreased to 3.4%
in 2000.
The effect of stratification on the results of the GPS is
shown in Table 4. The distribution of the count of
drug–ADR pairs between strata are, in general, subject
to random errors. The baseline frequencies or expected
counts (E) without stratification were not uniformly
smaller than those with stratification. Similarly, the
difference between the observed and expected counts
(N  E), RR (observed/expected), EBGM and EB05
without stratification were not uniformly larger than
those with stratification. However, the average differences of E, N  E, RR, EBGM and EB05 with and
without stratification were statistically significant
(Table 4). Similarly, the difference between 138 and
50 discordant pairs (Nny and Nyn) was also significant.
The variable that can be used for stratification in this
study is the year of report only and it has just three
values (i.e. 1998, 1999 and 2000) and the difference
between the fraction detected as a possible signal with
stratification (6.9%) and that without stratification
(7.1%) is small. Within this limitation, however, the
effect of stratification may be summarised as follows.
The difference between the observed and expected
counts of drug–ADR pairs (N  E) without stratification may be partitioned into the two components; i.e.
one due to the difference between the observed and
expected counts within the individual stratum and the
other component due to the uneven distribution of the
drug and ADR between strata. The stratification may
remove the latter component. Hence, the average
difference between the observed and expected counts
with stratification (1.391) was significantly smaller than
that without stratification (1.403) as shown in Table 4.
The average RR, EBGM and EB05 (signal score) were
also decreased and hence the fraction detected as a
possible signal was decreased by stratification. However, the issue may be examined further using larger
sets of data with more stratification variables.
The methodologies to detect possible signals are in
principle similar to each other.15,16 However, the
similarity of methods in terms of basic ideas does not
necessarily mean the pattern of possible signals is the
same between the signalling methods. As shown in
Table 1, the proportion of possible signals in the drug–
ADR combinations is different among the five

methods. The agreement is not good between the
MCA and PRRCI (kappa is less than 0.2, Table 2)
where the same disproportionality measure (the PRR)
is used, while the agreement is excellent between the
BCPNN and MCA (kappa is greater than 0.9, Table 2)
where the signalling criteria are substantially different
(the criterion of IC-2SD > 0 vs. the combination of
PRR  2, ‘a’  3 and w2  4). The dissimilarity of the
pattern may not decrease when the cut-off level is
simply changed. For example as shown in Table 1,
6.9% of the drug–ADR pairs were found as a possible
signal with the GPS, which was the smallest among the
five methods. If a less strict signalling criterion, e.g.
EB05 > 1.3 were used in the GPS instead of the
criterion EB05 > 2.0, the number of possible signals
detected would increase from 2664 (6.9%) to 4077
(10.5%). The number of possible signals would
therefore be similar to that with the MCA (4364 or
11.3%) and the BCPNN (3941 or 10.2%) as shown in
Table 1. However, with the criterion EB05 > 1.3, the
number of possible signals for the drug–ADR pairs
where the count ‘a’ is equal to 2 would increase from
464 (7.5%) to 865 (13.9%) while no possible signals
are detected for those pairs where ‘a’ ¼ 2 with the
MCA and BCPNN (Table 1). Therefore, a less strict
criterion for the GPS tends to magnify the discrepancy
of the pattern of possible signals between the methods.
However, the issue may be further examined using
different datasets. It is difficult to fully discuss
similarities and dissimilarities between various signalling methodologies by using one small dataset
examined in this study.
In summary, we examined the pattern of possible
signals detected by alternative methodologies. The
drug–ADR combinations detected as a possible signal
vary between methodologies particularly when the
count of drug–ADR pairs is 1 or 2.
