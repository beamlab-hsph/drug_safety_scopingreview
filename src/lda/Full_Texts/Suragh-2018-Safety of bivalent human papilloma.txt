AIMS
Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines prevent infection with oncogenic virus types. We analysed reports to the US Vaccine
Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) of adverse events (AE) following bivalent HPV vaccine (2vHPV).

METHODS
We conducted descriptive analysis of 2vHPV reports, reviewed individual reports, calculated crude AE reporting rates and
conducted empirical Bayesian data mining.

RESULTS
Of 241 2vHPV reports, 158 were in females, 64 in males (2vHPV is approved for females only) and 19 with unknown sex; 95.8%
were classiﬁed as nonserious. Dizziness, headache, nausea and injection site reactions were the most common symptoms. Crude
AE reporting rates were 33.3 reports per 100 000 doses distributed overall, and 1.4 per 100 000 for serious reports. Empirical
Bayesian data mining identiﬁed disproportional reporting for three types of medical errors; assessment indicated ﬁndings that
were probably driven by inadvertent 2vHPV use in males.

CONCLUSIONS
We did not identify any new or unexpected safety concerns in our review of 2vHPV reports to VAERS.

Safety of bivalent human papillomavirus vaccine in VAERS

Introduction
Human papillomavirus (HPV) bivalent (types 16, 18)
vaccine [2vHPV, Cervarix, GlaxoSmithKline (GSK)] was
licensed by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
in 2009 [1]. It is approved for use in females aged
9–25 years and is an HPV vaccine recommended by the
Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices for
females beginning at age 11 or 12 years, starting as early
as 9 years [1]. 2vHPV, in a three-dose series, is indicated for
prevention of diseases caused by oncogenic HPV types 16
and 18: cervical cancer, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia
grade 2 or worse, adenocarcinoma in situ, and cervical
intraepithelial neoplasia grade 1 [1].
2vHPV was not widely used in the USA (<2% of all HPV
vaccines distributed during 2009–2017; personal communication, GSK) and the manufacturer stopped marketing it
there in 2016. However, since 2014, 2vHPV has been licensed
and used in at least 134 countries [2]. Data from prelicensure
clinical trials and postlicensure safety monitoring indicate
that injection site reactions, fever, headache, nausea, dizziness, malaise and syncope are commonly reported adverse
events (AEs) following 2vHPV [3–5] – generally similar to
the safety proﬁle of the quadrivalent HPV vaccine [6]. We
conducted a review of reports submitted to the US Vaccine
Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) following 2vHPV
from 2009–2017 to add to the body of knowledge on its
safety.

Methods
VAERS is a spontaneous (i.e. passive) reporting system for AEs
following vaccination [7]. It is coadministered by the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the FDA and
accepts reports from healthcare providers, manufacturers,
and the public. Signs and symptoms of AEs are coded using
Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) terms
[8]. Reports are classiﬁed as serious based on the US Code of
Federal Regulations and deﬁnitions by the International
Conference on Harmonization if any of the following are
documented: hospitalization; prolongation of existing
hospitalization; permanent disability; life-threatening
illness; congenital anomaly; or death [9, 10]. Medical records
are requested for serious reports. VAERS is used to conduct
routine public health surveillance and is not subject to
Institutional Review Board review and informed consent
requirements.
We searched the VAERS database for reports following
2vHPV for persons vaccinated from 2009–2017, with reports
received by 31January 2018, to account for data lags. We excluded foreign source reports because most are submitted by
vaccine manufacturers and reporting requirements for their
foreign source reports are different from their US reports.
Therefore, foreign source and US reports may not be broadly
comparable on important characteristics. We conducted
descriptive analysis and reviewed each individual report.
We calculated crude AE reporting rates based on the number
of 2vHPV doses distributed in the USA during the analytic
period. Crude AE reporting rates are presented as reports per

100 000 2vHPV doses distributed. We conducted empirical
Bayesian data mining using established methods [11, 12] to
identify 2vHPV-AE pairs reported at least twice as frequently
as expected [i.e. lower bound of the 90% conﬁdence interval
surrounding the empirical Bayesian geometric mean
(EB05 > 2)] compared to all other US-licensed vaccines in
the VAERS database. We did not analyse 2vHPV data by dose
number as this information is often missing or inconsistently
reported.

Results
During the analytic period, VAERS received 241 US reports
following 2vHPV; 158 in females, 64 in males (2vHPV is not
approved for or recommended in males), and 19 with sex
not reported or unknown (Table 1).
Among the 158 reports in females, 149 (94.3%) were
nonserious and 93 (58.9%) were in persons aged
11–17 years; in 32 reports (20.3%), age was not reported
or unknown. Median time from vaccination to symptom
onset was 0 days (the day of vaccination) and ranged up
to 2.5 years. Most reports were submitted by healthcare
providers (38.6%) and manufacturers (34.8%; Table 1). In
97 (61.4%) reports, 2vHPV was given alone. In the 61 reports involving 2vHPV coadministered with other vaccines, commonly reported concomitant vaccines included
meningococcal conjugate (n = 39); tetanus and diphtheria
(Td), or Td and pertussis (n = 32); and varicella (n = 17).
Dizziness, headache, nausea and injection site reactions
(e.g. pain, swelling and erythema) were commonly reported symptoms (Table 2). Nine reports in females were
classiﬁed as serious: (i) Guillain-Barré syndrome (symptom
onset 37 days after vaccination and also preceded by a salmonella infection [date unspeciﬁed]); (ii) spontaneous
abortion (2vHPV is not recommended in pregnancy); (iii)
viral gastrointestinal infection; (iv) inﬂuenza-like symptoms; (v) abdominal pain; (vi) altered mental status; (vii)
optic neuritis; (viii) postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome; and (ix) vomiting, headache and mydriasis. There
was one nonserious report of complex regional pain
syndrome.
Among the 64 reports of males who received 2vHPV vaccine, median age was 13 years and symptom onset ranged
from 0 to 226 days. Sixty-three (98.4%) were nonserious and
the single serious report described fatigue, chills, cough, dehydration and back pain in a 14-year-old approximately
226 days after vaccine administration; the dose number in series was missing in this report. In 53 (82.8%) reports, 2vHPV
was given alone. In the 11 involving 2vHPV coadministered
with other vaccines; commonly reported concomitant vaccines included meningococcal conjugate (n = 8); Td or Td
and pertussis (n = 3); inﬂuenza (n = 3); and hepatitis A
(n = 3). Product use issue, wrong drug administered, interchange of vaccine products and drug administration error
were commonly reported events (Table 3). In 18 of the male
reports, only an administration error was documented, with
no adverse health event.
Approximately 723 502 2vHPV doses were distributed in
the

communication, GSK). With 241 total 2vHPV reports (231
nonserious and 10 serious), crude AE reporting rates were
33.3 per 100 000 doses distributed overall, 31.9 per 100 000
for nonserious reports, and 1.4 per 100 000 for serious reports. After factoring out the suspected administration error
reports where no AE was documented (213 nonserious and
10 serious), crude AE reporting rates were 30.8 per 100 000
doses distributed overall, 29.4 per 100 000 for nonserious reports and 1.4 per 100 000 for serious reports.
MedDRA preferred terms product use issue, wrong drug
administered and interchange of vaccine products exceeded the
empirical Bayesian data mining threshold (EB05 > 2) and
were not previously identiﬁed and characterized events associated with 2vHPV. Review of reports indicated ﬁndings were
driven by inadvertent 2vHPV use in males (i.e. administration errors).

Discussion
The results of our analysis of AEs reported to VAERS following
2vHPV are reassuring and are comparable to postlicensure
safety data for the more commonly used (in the USA) quadrivalent HPV vaccine (4vHPV). Overall, 95.8% of reports were
2930

Br J Clin Pharmacol (2018) 84 2928–2932

nonserious, similar to ﬁndings for 4vHPV (94.2%) [6]. Crude
AE reporting rates for 2vHPV and 4vHPV vaccines – 33.3 per
100 000 doses distributed versus 32.7 per 100, 000 doses distributed, respectively – were also similar. Injection site reactions, dizziness and headache were common symptoms in
2vHPV reports. This is consistent with prelicensure clinical
trial data and postlicensure surveillance from outside of the
USA, and is also similar to ﬁndings for 4vHPV in a large
postlicensure safety review in VAERS [2–6]. Our review of individual reports, which included cases of postural orthostatic
tachycardia syndrome, Guillain–Barré syndrome and complex regional pain syndrome, did not reveal any unusual or
unexpected patterns. Similarly, a review conducted by the
European Medicines Agency found no evidence to support a
causal association between HPV vaccines and postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome or complex regional pain syndrome [13].
VAERS is a passive reporting system with limitations including under-reporting, incomplete data, and lack of an unvaccinated comparison group [7]. Due to limitations, we
generally cannot determine if AEs are caused by vaccination
from VAERS data alone. For example, the single serious male
report with a delayed onset of 226 days for a constellation
of nonspeciﬁc signs and symptoms calls into question a

plausible biological relationship. Furthermore, estimates of
crude reporting rates using doses of 2vHPV vaccine distributed should be interpreted with caution, since the actual
numbers of doses administered are unknown. Despite these
limitations, VAERS is a valuable monitoring system to detect
potential vaccine safety problems that might require further
investigation using controlled studies.
Our analysis is the ﬁrst VAERS postlicensure safety assessment focused on 2vHPV and adds to the existing body
of evidence on the safety of 2vHPV. We did not identify
any new or unexpected safety concerns in our review of
2vHPV reports to VAERS from 2009–2017. The relatively
high number of reports in males, for whom 2vHPV is not
approved, and disproportional reporting for vaccine
administration errors in males compared to other vaccines
suggests some healthcare provider lack of awareness of
FDA-approved indications and Advisory Committee on
Immunization Practices recommendations.

Human papillomavirus (HPV) causes certain cancers in
women and men. HPV vaccines are highly effective in
preventing infection with oncogenic HPV types. However,
safety concerns have contributed to vaccine hesitancy. Our
review of postlicensure safety data of the bivalent HPV vaccine did not identify any new or unexpected safety concerns,
which may provide reassurance to patients, parents and
healthcare providers.
