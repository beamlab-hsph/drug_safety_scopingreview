Background: Myopericarditis after vaccination has been sporadically reported in the medical literature.
Here, we present a thorough descriptive analysis of reports to a national passive vaccine safety surveillance system (VAERS) of myopericarditis after vaccines licensed for use in the United States.
Methods: We identified U.S. reports of myopericarditis received by VAERS during 1990–2018 that met a
published case definition for myopericarditis or were physician-diagnosed. We stratified analysis by age
group (<19, 19–49, 50 years), describing reports by serious/non-serious status, sex, time to symptom
onset after vaccination, vaccine(s) administered, and exposure to other known causes of myopericarditis.
We used Empirical Bayesian data mining to detect disproportionate reporting of myopericarditis after
vaccination.
Results: VAERS received 620,195 reports during 1990–2018: 708 (0.1%) met the case definition or were
physician-diagnosed as myopericarditis. Most (79%) myopericarditis reports described males; 69% were
serious; 72% had symptom onset  2 weeks postvaccination. Overall, smallpox (59%) and anthrax (23%)
vaccines were most commonly reported. By age, among persons aged < 19 years, Haemophilus influenzae
type b (22, 22%) and hepatitis B (18, 18%); among persons aged 19–49 years smallpox (387, 79%); among
persons aged  50 years inactivated influenza (31, 36%) and live attenuated zoster (19, 22%) vaccines
were most commonly reported. The vaccines most commonly reported remained unchanged when
excluding 138 reports describing other known causes of myopericarditis. Data mining revealed disproportionate reporting of myopericarditis only after smallpox vaccine.
Conclusions: Despite the introduction of new vaccines over the years, myopericarditis remains rarely
reported after vaccines licensed for use in the United States. In this analysis, myopericarditis was most
commonly reported after smallpox vaccine, and less commonly after other vaccines.

Myocarditis (inflammation of the myocardium, or heart muscle)
and pericarditis (inflammation of the pericardium, or tissue overlying the heart muscle) often occur together (termed myopericarditis), and can range in severity from mild and without symptoms, to
severe [1]. Myopericarditis has many causes, including viral infections [1].
Although not establishing causality, myopericarditis has been
reported after vaccinations. Myopericarditis is known to occur
after administration of smallpox vaccine [2]. Amsel et al., described
myocarditis in a male aged 3 months after receiving both combined diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis (DTP) vaccine, and oral

tered routinely to selected populations, and myopericarditis
[2,14]. For each age group, we analyzed cases by seriousness of
report (death, serious, or non-serious), sex, and time from vaccination to onset of symptoms. In addition, we analyzed by whether
vaccines were given alone or concomitantly with other vaccines.
Because myopericarditis is commonly viral in origin in the community [1], we conducted a secondary analysis that excluded reports
in which patients exhibited signs or symptoms of influenza-like illness (including fever, malaise, upper or lower respiratory symptoms, gastrointestinal symptoms like nausea or vomiting) or had
a history of such symptoms within 42 days of symptom onset for
myopericarditis [14].

polio vaccine [3]. de Meester et al. described pericarditis after vaccination with influenza vaccine [4], Peyriere et al. described pericarditis after hepatitis B vaccine [5], and Mei et al. have
described recurrent pericarditis after inactivated influenza (IIV)
[6]. Except for smallpox vaccine, none of these reports described
vaccines licensed for use in the United States.
Myopericarditis after live virus vaccines other than smallpox
vaccine has been explored to some degree [7,8]. Reports of
myopericarditis after inactivated vaccines have been scant, mostly
after IIV [4,9], including a recently published case report attributing myocarditis to adjuvanted inactivated influenza vaccine
(FluadÒ , Sequirus) [9]. Further, several vaccines that are not IIV
– including both live attenuated and inactivated vaccines – have
been licensed for use in the United States over the past several
years. To better characterize myopericarditis after vaccination,
we reviewed and described reports of myopericarditis received
by the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS).

2.3. Estimated reporting rates
Data on doses of vaccine that were distributed or administered
are difficult to obtain. Estimating reporting rates of AEs after vaccination using data from VAERS is therefore challenging. For smallpox vaccine, doses administered data were unavailable, but doses
distributed data were available. We were able to estimate crude
reporting rates of myopericarditis after smallpox vaccine using
reports received during 2014 through 2018 as the numerator,
divided by doses distributed during the corresponding time period
(which included disbursements to the U.S. military) (Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention, Division of State and Local Readiness, personal communication) as the denominator; rates were
estimated as reports per 1,000 doses distributed. For influenza vaccine, vaccine coverage data were available, and could be used to
estimate doses administered. We therefore estimated annual crude
reporting rates for influenza vaccine (all types), with reports
received during 2014 through 2018 as the numerator, with population estimates and vaccine coverage for the corresponding year
multiplied as the denominator [18,19]; rates for 2 age groups (1–
17 years, 18 years) were estimated. From these annual crude
reporting rates, median rates of reports per million doses administered were estimated for 2014 through 2018.

2. Methods
2.1. Data source
VAERS is a national spontaneous reporting system for monitoring AEs after vaccination [10]. Reports of AEs following vaccines
licensed for use in the United States are accepted from healthcare
providers, vaccine manufacturers, vaccine recipients and other
persons and entities, including the military. Reported signs and
symptoms are coded using Medical Dictionary for Regulatory
Activities (MedDRA) Preferred Terms (PTs) [11]. MedDRA PTs are
not necessarily medically confirmed diagnoses, and a VAERS report
can be assigned multiple MedDRA PTs. The Code of Federal Regulations defines a report as serious if at least one of the following conditions is reported: death, life-threatening illness, hospitalization
or prolongation of existing hospitalization, permanent disability,
or a congenital anomaly or birth defect [12]. An AE might therefore
present as an acutely severe condition, but not be classified as a
serious report. For non-manufacturer serious reports, medical
records are routinely requested and made available to VAERS personnel. Due to regulatory processes [13], vaccine manufacturers
will request and review medical records before reporting a serious
report to VAERS: as a result, serious reports from vaccine manufacturers typically do not contain medical records that VAERS personnel can review.

2.4. Disproportionality analysis
Empirical Bayesian data mining techniques [17] were used to
identify MedDRA PTs related to myopericarditis that occurred
among U.S. reports more often than expected following each individual U.S. licensed vaccine: AEs after a given vaccine were compared to AEs reported for all vaccines, with adjustment for age,
sex, and year of report receipt. The statistic calculated for this data
mining analysis was the Empirical Bayes Geometric Mean (EBGM)
and its associated 90% confidence interval (EB05, EB95). An
EB05  2.0 indicates a vaccine-event pair occurs at least twice as
often as expected, assuming that vaccine-event pairs are random,
and is the commonly used threshold for considering an AE as a
potential signal [18]; we thus used an EB05  2.0. Disproportionality analyses are intended to assess potential associations between
a vaccine and an AE, but do not imply causality between the
vaccine-event pair.
The data in this analysis resulted from routine public health
surveillance activities. U.S. federal law specifies that these activities do not constitute research. This analysis was therefore exempt
from institutional review.

2.2. Descriptive analysis
We searched the VAERS database for reports of myocarditis,
pericarditis, myopericarditis, and perimyocarditis following vaccination received by VAERS during January 1, 1990 through December 31, 2018 (among U.S. reports processed by CDC through May
31, 2019). We searched for reports containing PTs that included
the words ‘‘myocarditis”, ‘‘coxsackie carditis”, ‘‘pericarditis”, and
‘‘pericardial effusion”; a complete list of PTs searched is available
in the Supplemental Materials. Our search included PTs from past
versions of the MedDRA browser, to capture reports using these
older PTs. All identified reports were reviewed for signs and symptoms that met case definitions previously used for surveillance of
myopericarditis after smallpox vaccine [14]; we also included for
review reports where there was a diagnosis by a physician, regardless of if the reported case met the published case definition.
Reports of cases that either met the definition for myocarditis or
pericarditis, or were diagnosed by a physician, were stratified by
age group (<19 years, 19–49 years, 50 years), in part because of
age differences in recommended vaccination schedules [15,16],
and the known association between smallpox vaccine, adminis-

During the analytic period, VAERS received a total of 620,195
reports. Of these reports, 708 (0.1%) either met the published case

reported persons had symptom onset within 7 days of vaccination). Also, in over half of reports among persons 18 years of age
and younger, the patient died. When excluding reports after smallpox vaccine, most reports still described males, were classified as
serious, reported time to symptom onset of 14 days or less, with
similar median ages and distribution of sex by age (data not
shown).
Considering all vaccines (regardless if administered with other
vaccines, or alone), the most frequently reported vaccines were
smallpox (59%), anthrax (23%), and typhoid (13%) vaccines; IIV
was also frequently reported (11%) (Table 2). Among persons
18 years of age and younger, the most frequently reported vaccines
were Haemophilus influenzae type b (22%) and hepatitis B (18%)

(79%), and most reports were classified as serious (69%), with a
reported time to symptom onset of 14 days or less (72%). Median
reported age was 24 years (range: 0 to 90 years): among
people  18 years of age, median age was 8 years (range: 0 to
18 years); among people 19 to 49 years of age, median age was
25 years (range: 19 to 49 years), with 75% of reports among people
19 to 31 years of age; among people  50 years, median age was
64 years (range: 50 to 90 years). We observed notable differences
by age group: most reports (69%) were among persons 19 to
49 years of age, most of whom (90%) were males, and most of
whom reported a time to symptom onset of 8 to 14 days after vaccination (whereas for other age groups, the greatest proportion of

myopericarditis on autopsy. Reported median time to symptom
onset was 8 days after vaccination (range: 0 to 1,025 days). When
excluding these 138 reports from consideration, the most frequently reported vaccines – both administered with other vaccines
and administered alone – the order of vaccines most commonly
reported did not change appreciably (Tables 4 and 5).
We identified 75 reports of myopericarditis in which the patient
died. Median reported age was 7 years (range: 0 to 80 years); 40
reported patients were male, and 35 were female. Median time
to onset of myopericarditis was 6 days after vaccination (range:
0 to 571 days). In 60 (80%) reports, myopericarditis could be attributed to other known causes (e.g., viral infection, disseminated bacterial infection, systemic lupus erythematosus), including 45 of 54
(83%) reported deaths among patients aged 0 to 18 years (Table 1).
Of the remaining 15 reports, the reported vaccines reflected recommended vaccines for the patient’s age: among 5 reports describing patients < 1 year of age, 4 received vaccines containing
diphtheria and tetanus toxoids, and acellular pertussis antigen ,
and 3 received pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (2 received the

of age and older IIV (36%) and live attenuated zoster (22%) vaccines
were most frequently reported.
Of vaccines administered alone, the most frequently reported
vaccines were smallpox (53%) and IIV (12%) vaccines (Table 3).
By age, among persons 18 years of age and younger, the most frequently reported vaccines were 4-valent human papillomavirus
(HPV) (25%) and hepatitis B (13%) vaccines; among persons 19 to
49 years of age, smallpox vaccine (71%) was most frequently
reported; and among persons 50 years of age and older IIV (38%)
and live attenuated zoster (23%) vaccines were most frequently
reported.
Of the 708 identified reports of myopericarditis, 138 (19%)
described signs or symptoms of influenza-like illness up to 42 days
prior to symptom onset for myopericarditis. Reported median age
was 24 years (range: 0 to 90 years); 101 (73%) reported persons
were male, and 37 (27%) were female. Of these 138 reports, 129
reports were serious, including 31 (24%) reports where the patient
died; 21 (68%) of these reported deaths had histologic evidence of

18 years of age and younger found a comparable proportion
(57%) of cases among males [19], but a case series among adults
hospitalized in a group of Finnish hospitals found a preponderance
of cases among males<55 years of age [20]. A potential explanation
for these differences by sex and age remains elusive, although findings in studies with BALB/c mouse models of acute coxsackievirusinduced myocarditis suggest possible biologic mechanisms [21,22].
The patients in both case series would be considered serious by
definition (due to hospitalization); likewise, a large proportion of
serious reports were observed in the VAERS data.
Reported case fatality after acute myocarditis among pediatric
patients has been reported around 8% to 12% [23,24]. The high proportion of deaths reported among persons 18 years of age and
younger in this analysis (Table 1) would seem unusual. However,
biased reporting to VAERS can occur, and deaths after vaccination
among otherwise healthy young people might be more prone to
report compared to deaths among older or less healthy populations
[10]. Conversely, younger persons (such as children) who experience mild myopericarditis might not be reported to VAERS; such
lack of reporting would skew the proportion of reported deaths
among this population. These and other limitations of VAERS will
be discussed shortly.
The high proportion of reported myopericarditis after smallpox
vaccine (Tables 2 and 3) likely reflects the known association
between myopericarditis and smallpox vaccine [2,14], which is
also reflected in the disproportionality analysis results. The preponderance of myopericarditis after smallpox vaccine reported
among people 19 to 31 years of age (predominately male) in this
analysis is consistent with smallpox vaccination among selected
military personnel [25]. Indeed, during the analytic period, the military conducted active surveillance (and subsequent reporting to
VAERS) of myopericarditis after smallpox vaccine [26]. Despite this
potential simulated reporting, the most frequently reported vaccines, by age range, would not vary after discounting smallpox vaccine (Tables 3 and 4) (except among people 19–49 years of age).
Disproportionate reporting of anthrax and typhoid vaccines and
myopericarditis-related PTs likely reflect coadministration with
smallpox vaccine, as was common practice in the military during
the analytic period [26].
During 2008–2018, ACAM2000Ò was the smallpox vaccine in
use (prior to 2008, DryvaxÒ was the smallpox vaccine used).
Myopericarditis after ACAM2000 has been reported at rate of 5.7
per 1,000 doses administered [27]. A rate of 6.9 per 1,000 doses
administered has been reported among people receiving their first
dose of ACAM2000 [28]. The estimated reporting rate of myopericarditis we observed after smallpox vaccine during 2014–2018 (4.0
per 1,000 doses distributed) is comparable to these rates.

13-valent vaccine, 1 received the 7-valent vaccine); among 4
reports describing patients 12 to 18 years of age, 2 received
meningococcal conjugate vaccines, 1 received 4-valent HPV vaccine, and another received monovalent mumps vaccine; among 6
reports describing patients 19 years of age and older, 2 received
smallpox vaccine, 2 received influenza vaccine (not specified), 1
received IIV, and 1 received live attenuated zoster vaccine.
3.2. Estimated reporting rates
During 2014 through 2018, myopericarditis after smallpox vaccine was reported to VAERS at an estimated rate of 4.0 per 1,000
doses distributed. Regardless of age group, estimated median
reporting rates of myopericarditis during 2014 through 2018 after
influenza vaccine (all types) was < 0.1 per 1,000,000 doses
administered.
3.3. Disproportionality analysis
Disproportionality analysis identified an elevated EB05 (2.0)
for smallpox vaccine and the myopericarditis-related PTs of
‘‘Myocarditis”, ‘‘Pericardial disease”, ‘‘Pericardial effusion”, and
‘‘Pericarditis”. An EB05  2.0 was found for anthrax vaccine and
the PTs ‘‘Myocarditis”, ‘‘Pericardial disease”, and ‘‘Pericarditis”;
most patients (95%) received a concomitant smallpox vaccine. An
EB05  2.0 was also identified for typhoid vaccine and the PT ‘‘Pericardial disease”; review of these typhoid vaccine reports revealed
that all patients received smallpox vaccine concomitantly with
typhoid vaccine. No other product-specific vaccine had an
EB05  2.0 for any myopericarditis-related PT.
4. Discussion
We performed a comprehensive review of post-licensure vaccine surveillance data on myopericarditis, using both a published
case definition [14] and review of medical records to identify such
reports. Smallpox vaccine remained the most commonly reported
vaccine, while other reported vaccines were consistent with vaccine types recommended for the given age group of the patient
and therefore might reflect relative frequencies of vaccine exposures per recommended schedules for vaccination [17,18].
Myopericarditis remained a rarely reported AE after vaccines
(0.1% of reported AEs during the analytic period), and this analysis
revealed no new or unexpected safety concerns.
Distribution of reports by sex was similar to previous case series
among hospitalized pediatric and adult patients (Table 1). A case

Other vaccines after which myopericarditis was reported largely reflect recommended vaccination schedules for people in the
corresponding age groups [15,16]. Myopericarditis has not been
described previously after hepatitis B, Haemophilus influenzae type
b, 9-valent HPV, or live attenuated zoster vaccines that were
licensed for use in the United States, and only sparse case reports
describe myocarditis after inactivated influenza and diphtheria,
tetanus, and inactivated polio vaccines [9,29,30]. Myopericarditis
has been reported after 4-valent HPV vaccine [31]. Of interest,
myopericarditis is commonly caused by viral infections, [1] including varicella zoster virus [32]. Discounting smallpox vaccine,
myopericarditis after live attenuated viral vaccines was reported
infrequently (Tables 2 and 3), a result consistent with a past report
describing no increased risk of myopericarditis after live attenuated virus vaccines (except smallpox vaccine) [7]. Together, these
observations suggest that – aside from smallpox vaccine –
myopericarditis after vaccines licensed for use in the United States
is rare. As noted in the below paragraph, these reports do not
establish a causal relationship between vaccines and
myopericarditis.
VAERS is a passive surveillance system that gathers reports
from across the United States, and can detect rare events [10], like
myopericarditis, after vaccination. VAERS also shares the limitations of passive surveillance systems: under-reporting, reporting
biases, inconsistent data quality and completeness, changes in
reporting over time, and lack of an unvaccinated comparison group
[10,13]. These limitations generally do not allow VAERS data to
determine if a vaccine caused a particular adverse event, including
myopericarditis or death. Also, because doses administered data
were not available, we used doses distributed as the denominator
in estimating reporting rates after smallpox vaccine. That our estimates (4.0 per 1,000 doses distributed) are comparable to known
rates of myopericarditis after smallpox vaccine (5.7 per 1,000 doses
administered) is reassuring. Also reassuring is the confirmation of
the known association between smallpox vaccine and cardiacrelated PTs on disproportionality analysis (EB05 > 2).
Given that smallpox vaccine continues to be administered to
selected military and civilian personnel [25,33] and that new vaccines continue to be approved for use, continuing surveillance for
myopericarditis after vaccination is warranted. However, this analysis revealed no unexpected safety concerns, and reports of
myopericarditis after vaccines remain rare.
