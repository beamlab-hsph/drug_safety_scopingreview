ABSTRACT
Objective: Opioid-based analgesia is routinely used in clinical practice for the management of pain and alleviation of suffering at the end of life. It is well-known that opioid-based medications can be highly addictive,
promoting not only abuse but also life-threatening overdoses. The scope of opioid-related adverse events (AEs)
beyond these well-known effects remains poorly described. This exploratory analysis investigates potential AEs
from drug-drug interactions between opioid and nonopioid medications (ODIs).
Materials and Methods: In this study, we conduct an initial exploration of the association between ODIs and severe AEs using millions of AE reports available in FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS). The odds ratio
(OR)-based analysis and visualization are proposed for single drugs and pairwise ODIs to identify associations
between AEs and ODIs of interest. Moreover, the multilabel (multi-AE) learning models are employed to evaluate the feasibility of AE prediction of polypharmacy.
Results: The top 12 most prescribed opioids in the FAERS are identified. The OR-based analysis identifies a diverse set of AEs associated with individual opioids. Moreover, the results indicate many ODIs can increase the
risk of severe AEs dramatically. The area under the curve values of multilabel learning models of ODIs for oxycodone varied between 0.81 and 0.88 for 5 severe AEs.
Conclusions: The proposed data analysis and visualization are useful for mining FAERS data to identify novel
polypharmacy associated AEs, as shown for ODIs. This approach was successful in recapitulating known drug
interactions and also identified new opioid-specific AEs that could impact prescribing practices.
Key words: opioid, opioid-drug interaction, adverse drug effects

INTRODUCTION
Adverse events (AEs) are unexpected and potentially injurious side
effects and harms which occur during typical usage of a medication.1 In the United States, approximately 3–7% of hospitalizations
are caused by AEs, 10–20% of hospitalizations include AEs, and

10–20% of these AEs are severe.2 Opioids is a generic term for a
class of medications which activate central and peripheral opioid
receptors, producing analgesia and other physiological effects, such
as decreased heart and respiratory rates,3,4 which also can promote
addiction leading to potential overdose and death. In 2016, there

were approximately 42 000 deaths involving opioids in the United
States, which represents a 21.4% increase from 2015.5 Additional
well-known AEs associated with opioids include nausea, vomiting,
dizziness, and constipation.6
In practice, opioids are often coprescribed for patients with a
complicated medical history who are concurrently taking a wide array of additional medications.7 Beyond the aforementioned welldescribed AEs; however, little is known about the potential for
drug-drug interactions between opioid and nonopioid medications.
As a result, opioids are often coprescribed with limited information
on opioid-drug interactions (ODIs).
The Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) Adverse Event
Reporting System (FAERS)8 is a database that contains reported AEs
and medication errors involving FDA-approved drugs. The AE reports
in FAERS previously have been mined previously to identify potential
AEs for specific drugs.9–11 Using FAERS data, some common severe
AEs, such cardiovascular incidents, abuse, death, and overdose have
been associated with pain-killers, such as nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), acetaminophen, and opioids.12
Despite widespread use of opioids and the significant burden of
opioid-related adverse outcomes, to the best of our knowledge; however, the linkage of AEs and ODIs have not been well investigated. It
is common for opioids to be prescribed to patients taking other medications (polypharmacy), often in the setting of complex medical conditions (eg, traumatic brain injury7) but medical providers lack
general safety parameters to guide decision making when combining
opioids with other medications. In this preliminary study, we explore
the association between ODIs and severe AEs using AE reports in the
FAERS database. Using the odds ratio (OR) analysis of single and
pairwise ODIs, we identify a set of opioid-specific ODIs that are
highly associated with the risk for a set of severe AEs. We also implement a novel visualization method to show the ODIs associated with
increased risk of individual AEs. Lastly, we applied multilabel machine learning models to evaluate the feasibility of predicting the association of a specific AE for the use of multiple medicine including
opioids to improve the safety of medical treatment. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. First, we identify the mostly commonly
reported opioids in the FAERS database along with their reporting frequency. We then introduce the approaches for data preprocessing and
AE identification for the most commonly prescribed opioids, as well
as the methods employed for the OR analysis of both single-drug and
pairwise ODIs, as well as the evaluation of multilabel learning models
to predict the AEs of polypharmacy. In the Results section, we provide
the top 20 associated AEs for the top 5 reported opioids, the list and
visualization of top-ranked ODIs are associated with each of 18 selected AEs for oxycodone and hydrocodone, as well as AE prediction
evaluation using 3 multilabel learning models. The article concludes
with the Discussion and Conclusion sections.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Opioids
In this preliminary study, we conducted our analysis on the top 12
opioids reported in the FAERS database, which is an expanded list
of the most commonly prescribed opioids according to the National
Institute on Drug Abuse (Table 1).6,7,13

AE reports in the FAERS database and preprocessing
To study the AEs of opioids induced by ODIs, we collected AE
reports from the FAERS database reported over the past 14 years,
from October 1, 2003 through September 30, 2017. AEs are defined

as the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA).14
MedDRA is a medical terminology dictionary and is the dictionary
of AE classification. In total, there were 9 805 596 case records
reported with at least one of AE by this criterion. In this study, we
limited our scope to FDA-approved small molecular drugs. A list of
2521 FDA-approved small molecule opioids was retrieved from
DrugBank (version 5.1.0).15 After comparing drug names in the
FAERS database with FDA-approved drugs, we removed 5 756 511
AEs (58.7%) that did not contain any drug in the FDA-approved
list. In addition, we limited our interest to drugs reported at least
1000 times with an AE proportion of no less than 0.5% in the
FAERS database. In the end, we collected 4 094 084 AE reports associated with 774 drugs and 151 AEs. The procedure of data preprocessing is demonstrated in Figure 1.

OR analysis to identify and visualize associations
between ODIs and increased risk of severe AEs
OR is a technique to quantify the risk of an event with data presented
in a 2-by-2 contingency table (see Figure 2). In the contingency table,
both the column variable (AE of interest) and the row variable (drug
of interest) are binary: present (þ) or absent (). The co-occurrence of
any drug-AE pair is categorized into 4 conditions: “–,” “þ,” “þ,”
and “þþ”. Then, we convert the FAERS data into a series of 2-by-2
contingency tables with populated numbers of counts: N11 , N12 , N21 ,
11 N22
and N22 . The OR is calculated as OR ¼ N
N12 N21 .
For each AE, we calculated all the ORs of all individual drugs,
denoted as Drug.OR for nonopioid drugs and Opioid.OR for individual opioids, and calculated the ORs of all pairwise ODIs (with
one opioid drug colisted with another nonopioid drug), denoted as
Pair.OR. For example, if oxycodone is colisted with 3 other nonopioid drugs in an AE report, 3 different Pair.OR’s would be calculated, one for each opioid-nonopioid combination. Then, the
Fisher’s exact test was performed to confirm the ORs of specific AEs
of given ODIs. In order to control the experiment-wise false alarm
rate at 0.05, a Bonferroni correction was applied.
To facilitate the visualization of ODIs with increased risk of
specific AEs, we implemented a new type of visualization plot (see
Figures 3–5). As can be seen in the upper panels of Figures 3–5, the
x-axis and y-axis are the relative OR for both ODIs, Pair.OR/Opioid.OR, and relative OR of drugs, Drug.OR/Opioid.OR. Thus,
opioid-specific ODIs (eg, oxycodone [opioid]-anagrelide[drug] interaction, represented by “anagrelide”) that are above the solid-bold

line are associated with an increased risk of severe AEs (eg, renal
failure). ODIs with more than a 1.5-fold Opioid.OR and a P value
< .05, ODIs with an Opioid.OR  0.75 and  1.5 and a P value 
.05, and ODIs with an Opioid.OR < 0.75 and a P value < .05 are
labeled as “þ,” “o,” and “D” symbols, respectively. Moreover, the
OR density plots (lower panel) indicate the odd ratios of the specified AEs are increased by interacting with the opioid. In other
words, the Pair.OR (ORs of DOIs) has a heavier tailed distribution
compared with Drug.OR (ORs of single drugs). The OR of the opioid is also plotted. In addition, names of the top 10 ranked drugs
interacting with the given opioid are displayed. The ODI plots can
be updated conveniently by changing specific parameters.

AE prediction of polypharmacy using multilabel
learning models
In addition to the identification of pairwise ODIs using the OR analysis and visualization, we further evaluated the feasibility of predicting ODI AEs containing multiple drugs and oxycodone (the most
reported opioid in FAERS).

Problem formulation
Let n be the number of AE reports (n ¼ 91 073), p be the number of
total drugs involved in all reports (P ¼ 774), and m represent types
of AE. For example, in this preliminary study, 5 type of AEs are

package was used to call the BR.lr and CC.lr models, and the
“randomforestSRC”21 R package was used to call the RFSRC
model. We evaluate the prediction models by dividing the dataset
using 5-fold cross-validation, that is, the dataset is randomly divided into 5 folds, and 4 folds (80% of the data) are used as training data, and the rest 20% are used as the testing data. The
average of the following metrics is used to evaluate the performance of the models.
Prediction evaluation metrics

For interpretation purposes, hamming loss is defined as the fraction of the wrongly predicted AE labels (0 or 1) to the total number

of AE labels (a report might be associated with multiple AEs). Subset
0/1 loss is defined as the fraction of reports that have at least one AE
label predicted wrongly. Accuracy is defined as the fraction of correctly predicted AE labels to the total number of AE labels. Precision
is defined as the fraction of true positive and also predicted positive
AE labels to the predicted positive AE labels. F1 score is defined as
an average of the fraction of true positive and also predicted positive
AE labels to the predicted positive AE labels, and the fraction of true
positive and also predicted positive AE labels to the true positive AE
labels.

RESULTS
Top 20 AEs for the 5 most commonly reported opioids
Table 2 shows the top 20 AEs associated with the top 5 reported
opioid drugs in FAERS. Not surprisingly, the top 20 AEs for the
individual opioid drugs are different but encompass many of the
well-known, opioid AEs, such as abuse, overdose, and vomiting.
Aside from the expected AEs associated with opioids, each medication has a unique subset of additional AEs, for instance, epistaxis
was more commonly reported with codeine than the other opioids.
It suggests that opioid-specific ODIs and associated AEs should be
investigated separately.

Top-ranked ODIs inducing 18 selected severe AEs
In this pilot study, we empirically chose 18 common and severe AEs
for further analysis: death, pneumonia, anemia, hypotension, depression, hypertension, myocardial infarction, renal failure, sepsis, overdose, completed suicide, cardiac arrest, hemorrhage, diabetes mellitus,
drug abuse, cardiorespiratory arrest, pulmonary embolism, and
thrombosis. Tables 3 and 4 show the top 5 ODIs, based on the
pair.OR, associated with an increased risk for the 18 selected severe
AEs for opioids for oxycodone and hydrocodone, respectively. As can
be seen, the top-ranked ODIs are diverse and heterogenous for differ-

ent AEs, given the same opioid. In addition, we graphically represent
the top 5 ODIs and 5 associated AEs in a network map (see Figure 3),
which can clearly and intuitively display the ODI-AE associations. As
aforementioned, for given specific AEs, we implemented a new way to
visualize the pair.OR of opioid-specific ODIs. In Figures 4 and 5, we
show the top-ranked ODIs with 5 severe AEs (renal failure, pulmonary embolism, cardiac arrest, cardiorespiratory arrest, and pneumonia) for oxycodone and hydrocodone, respectively. As shown in the
figures, diverse and distinct ODI-AE pairs emerge for each opioid,
suggesting potential drug interactions that may necessitate different
prescribing practices to prevent specific AEs.

ODI AE prediction for oxycodone
In addition to the OR-based analysis to identify ODIs and associated
AEs, we further demonstrated the feasibility of applying multilabel
learning models to predict AEs in patients with multiple reports. We
selected 5 AEs of interest (ie, renal failure, pulmonary embolism, cardiac arrest, cardiorespiratory arrest, and pneumonia) that were
reported with the presence of oxycodone. Three learning methods
have been evaluated (ie, BR.lr: Binary relevance with logistic regression; CC.lr: Classifier Chains with logistic regression; and RFSRC:
random forest adapted for multilabel classification). We used 5-fold
cross validation to evaluate the model performance based on the

score, accuracy, and precision. Figure 6 (upper panel) shows the average values of these metrics on the 5 selected AEs. In addition, Figure 6
(lower panel) shows the average area under the curve values of the 3
models for the AEs. The results indicate that the random forest SRC
model outperformed the other models in all evaluation metrics.

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION
Opioids are a commonly prescribed class of medications and are frequently taken in combination with other medications in the management of patients with acute and chronic pain. Although there is
considerable potential for AEs, the associated AEs of ODIs has not
been well investigated. Herein, we conducted an initial exploration
of ODI-AE associations by mining millions of AE reports in the
FAERS database. Using this approach to AE identification, we were

able to recapitulate the well-known AEs associated with opioids, including constipation, abuse, and cardiopulmonary arrest. Furthermore, through the pairwise analysis of opioid-associated AEs, we
were also able to recreate common, other well-known medication
AEs, such as estrogen-induced venous thromboembolism,
immunosuppressive-therapy associated risk of pneumonia, and
higher cardiopulmonary arrest with benzodiazepine use.22–24 Together, this knowledge recreation lends credence to the methodology
used in this exploratory analysis.
Furthermore, the results of this study suggest individual opioids
have unique AEs, potentially related to drug-specific off-target
effects. For instance, fentanyl was associated with hyperhydrosis
while hydrocodone was associated with gastroesophageal reflux disease. It is certainly possible that many of the identified associations
are the result of underlying patient comorbidities that are being
treated rather than a direct medication effect, but it is also possible

112

that opioids potentiate the AEs reported. To further stratify these
associations, we will need to consider disease-specific treatments.
For instance, a strong association between hydrocodone, riociguat
and pulmonary embolism emerged in our cohort. However, riociguat is a medication used to treat inoperable or persistent postsurgical chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension, and as such,
it is unlikely that this association represents a true ODI between
hydrocodone and riociguat. By encompassing disease-level treatment bundles into this tool, we can further enrich the results produced by this pipeline.
In addition, since the FAERS database does not contain a patient
cohort without the associated AE, the relative prevalence of the AEs
and ODIs may be over represented in the OR calculation. By incorporating additional patient characteristics, such as age, gender, and
comorbidities, the risk of specific AEs for a given ODI can be more
accurately measured. Also, it is not a trivial task for the drug name
comparison and normalization to make use of the reports more accurately in FEARS database. Moreover, the OR analysis depends on
the properly constructed confusions matrix. It might be biased and
not accurate to use all reported AEs to calculate the negative cases
for OR calculation. Ideally, people who were given the drug but
reported no AEs should be used as the negative. However, these
data were not included in FAERS. Therefore, in addition to FAERS
data, it is important to integrate more electronic health record
(EHR) data and also big datasets of claims and pharmacy to identify
more and unbiased negative controls to further evaluate the potential ODIs and associated AEs. In the last section of this study, we
also create a process to use the FAERS database to train machine
learning models to predict potential AEs for given ODIs. These models could further be enhanced using sophisticated deep learning
models to integrate chemical structure features to identify ODIs associated with severe AEs. Once validated, it is our hope that this
pipeline could be helpful to facilitate the identification of additional
drug-drug interactions to improve safe prescribing practices.
