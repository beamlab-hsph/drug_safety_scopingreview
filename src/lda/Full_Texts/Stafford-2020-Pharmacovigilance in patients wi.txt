Objectives: The current demographic information from China reports that 10%-19% of patients
hospitalized with coronavirus disease (COVID-19) were diabetic. Angiotensin-converting
enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) are considered ﬁrstline agents in patients with diabetes because of their nephroprotective effects, but administration of these drugs leads to upregulation of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which
is responsible for the viral entry of severe acute respiratory distress syndrome coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2). Data are lacking to determine what pulmonary effects ACEIs or ARBs may have
in patients with diabetes, which could be relevant in the management of patients infected
with SARS-CoV-2. This study aims to assess the prevalence of pulmonary adverse drug effects
(ADEs) in patients with diabetes who were taking ACEI or ARBs to provide guidance as to how
these medications could affect outcomes in acute respiratory illnesses such as SARS-CoV-2
infection.
Methods: 1DATA, a unique data platform resulting from collaboration across veterinary and
human health care, used an intelligent medicine recommender system (1DrugAssist) developed using several national and international databases to evaluate all ADEs reported to the
Food and Drug Administration for patients with diabetes taking ACEIs or ARBs.
Results: Mining of this data elucidated the proportion of a cluster of pulmonary ADEs associated with speciﬁc medications in these classes, which may aid health care professionals in
understanding how these medications could worsen or predispose patients with diabetes to
infections affecting the respiratory system, speciﬁcally COVID-19. Based on this data mining
process, captopril was found to have a statistically signiﬁcantly higher incidence of pulmonary
ADEs compared with other ACEIs (P ¼ 0.005) as well as ARBs (P ¼ 0.012), though other speciﬁc
drugs also had important pulmonary ADEs associated with their use.
Conclusion: These analyses suggest that pharmacists and clinicians will need to consider the
speciﬁc medication’s adverse event proﬁle, particularly captopril, on how it may affect infections and other acute disease states that alter pulmonary function, such as COVID-19.

In late 2019, an outbreak of pneumonia, later found to be
caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2), occurred in Wuhan, China. Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) patient symptomatology includes fever,
dyspnea, myalgia, and pneumonia, but can also progress to
acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute cardiac
injury, as well as acute kidney injury and death.1 A study
evaluating 191 patients with COVID-19 found that 48% of

patients had comorbid conditions, including 19% with
diabetes.2 There was a statistically signiﬁcant difference
(P ¼ 0.001) in mortality between patients with comorbid
conditions, including diabetes, compared with those
without.2 It is known that long term hyperglycemia has
deleterious effects on many organ systemsdmost notably
the eyes, kidneys, nerves, and heart. However, less research
has described the pathophysiologic effects diabetes may
have on the respiratory system. In light of the recent
COVID-19 outbreak, more research is needed to understand
the effects that diabetes (and its medications) may have on
the respiratory system and how that could affect the management of diseases such as COVID-19.
The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is implicated in the
pathophysiology of numerous disease states including diabetic
nephropathy and hypertension. Drugs affecting this system
have been explored to manage nephropathy occurring in patients with diabetes, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) are
the ones currently recommended.3,4 Currently available ACEIs
differ based on potency, pharmacokinetics (especially tissue
distribution), and whether the molecule is a prodrug. ACEIs are
also delineated into 3 structural classes based on the functional group responsible for binding to ACE.5,6 Although ACEIs
and ARBs are generally considered to have similar adverse
event proﬁles, evaluation of postmarketing ADEs may shed
light on minute differences that could have important clinical
impacts.
RAS has been a subject of discussion in the wake of the
SARS-CoV-2 pandemic because ACE2, a membrane-bound
receptor involved in RAS, has been found to be the hostcell receptor responsible for viral entry. This was also true
for SARS-CoV, which lead to an outbreak in 2002. Administration of ACEIs and ARBs, as well as thiazolidinediones
and ibuprofen, leads to the upregulated expression of
ACE2.7 The upregulation of ACE2 receptors theoretically
puts patients at higher risk of infection with SARS-CoV-2
because more target host receptors would be available for
cellular virus entry. Conversely, ACE2 presence was found to
be protective in lung tissue of animal models due to the
conversion of angiotensin II to angiotensin (1-7), which has
vasodilatory properties. Animal models have shown an increase in ACE concentration can result in pulmonary
ﬁbrosis, asthma, and ARDS. The effects of ACE-inhibiting
medications, which will lower the activity of ACE (and
therefore the concentration of angiotensin II), would theoretically be protective against patients developing ARDS.7
This has led to the hypothesis that ACEIs or ARBs may be
detrimental in early SARS-CoV-2 infection but paradoxically
protective in later stages. RAS is exceedingly complex, and
conﬂicting data are available regarding the contribution of
ACEIs and ARBs on the mortality and morbidity of COVID-19
patients.8

Methods
Data sources and data mining
The 1DATA partnership between the University of
Missouri-Kansas City and Kansas State University has led to
the development of a platform to share human and animal
health care data.9 In this partnership, public databases were
integrated into the 1DATA database (www.1DATA.life), and, in
this study, were used to assess the incidence of ADEs related to
ACEIs and ARBs in patients with diabetes.10
The data used in this study were curated from multiple
publicly available data sources for patients with diabetes
including the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Adverse
Event Reporting System (FAERS), which houses all ADEs reported to the FDA by pharmaceutical companies, health care
providers, and consumers. The data, including the diabetes
dataset, are updated quarterly by the FDA and currently includes reports submitted from the ﬁrst quarter of 2004 to the
last quarter of 2019. This dataset mainly focuses on drugs and
their ADEs but also includes other pertinent data such as
disease information, drug information, adverse drug event
data, demographic information, as well as outcome data.
Internationally, ADE terminologies are reported by a similar
process to the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities
(MedDRA). In this database, ADE terminologies are hierarchically structured to regulate information for medical products
on a global level. The data structure of these terms is organized in
accordance with MedDRA terminology as well as the International Council for Harmonization of Technical Requirements for
Pharmaceuticals for Human Use, an international safety
reporting guidance database. We used the MedDRA hierarchy for
regulatory information of medical products in diabetes
including low-level terms (LLTs) as well as high-level terms
(HLTs). LLTs provide very descriptive information that is grouped
into preferred terms and the HLTs, which provide information on
anatomy, pathology, physiology, etiology, or function. HLTs are
then clustered into system organ classes, which are grouped
based on etiology, manifestation site, or purpose. Here we used
the 23.0 or earlier version of MedDRA10
Data mining algorithms were used for diabetes datasets to
identify postmarketing ADEs reported more frequently than
expected by comparing those frequencies with information on
all drugs and events in the database using the proportional
reporting ratio (PRR), as explained below.11 Databases are reported by a combination of active ingredients, generic names,
or brand names. Hence, the drug names were mapped to drug
parents using the DrugBank (Alberta InnovateseHealth
Solutions, The Metabolomics Innovation Center).12 Finally,
ADEs associated with medications in the ACEI and ARB classes
administered to patients with diabetes were recorded.

Statistical analysis
Objective(s)
In this study, we aimed to assess if each ACEI or ARB had
particularly serious pulmonary adverse event proﬁles, which
could either place patients with diabetes at increased risk for
SARS-CoV-2 infection due to diminished lung function or may
affect their management.
e146

Statistical analysis was performed using Statistical Analysis
Software (SAS) (SAS University Edition version 9.4, Cary, NC).
First, data based on the frequency of each ADE related to respiratory, thoracic, and mediastinal disorders or infections were
parsed in the MedDRA and FAERS databases. Speciﬁc ADEs
collected were pulmonary edema, pleural effusion, oropharyngeal pain, dyspnea, dysphonia, cough, sinusitis, pneumonia,

SCIENCE AND PRACTICE

nasopharyngitis, bronchitis, pneumonia aspiration, emphysema,
and pleurisy (Figure 1). We then employed a method proposed
and implemented by the FDA for analyzing ADE disproportionality in pharmacovigilance data by observed-expected
ratios.11 This method, the PRR, provides a statistical summary for
the commonality of an ADE for a speciﬁc drug as compared with
the entire database for drugs in the same or other classes.11
We addressed confounding factors including patient demographics and drugs that are underreported in voluntary
reporting systems including the FAERS since conditional
slicing and subsetting can conﬁne the use of quantitative
signal detection methods such as PRR. For this purpose, we
were able to correct the analysis after applying logistic
regression for the known covariates of age, weight, and sex,
and combine this approach with PRR to improve analyses of
drug effects using the diabetes datasets. We found that these
factors do not play a substantial role in the analysis of the data.
We found that the most important ADEs (pulmonary edema,
dyspnea, dysphonia, cough, bronchitis, and pleurisy), which
may be very relevant to SARS-CoV-2 infection, are not statistically significantly affected by any of these covariates (age,
sex, and weight). As a result, we assumed that:

PrðADEjdrug; age; weight; sexÞ ¼ PrðADEjdrugÞ
However, the following ADEs exhibited some sex or age
effects (ADE: effect): (1) pleural effusion: sex; (2) oropharyngeal pain: sex; (3) sinusitis: sex; (4) pneumonia: age; (5)
nasopharyngitis: sex; (6) pneumonia aspiration: sex; and (7)
emphysema: age.
This helped us to estimate a PRR for a speciﬁc drug-ADE
combination by calculating the following equation:

nonparametric Friedman test for 2 independent unequal-sized
data using SAS. Friedman test was also applied to perform
multiple comparison tests (P values for statistical signiﬁcance
< 0.05). For the nonparametric Friedman test of statistical
signiﬁcance, 4 pairwise and multiple comparisons were performed based on the ARBs and ACEIs excluding captopril,
hence denoted as ACEI-1 (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, excluding captopril). Tests performed included ACEI-1
versus ARB drugs, ACEI-1 drugs versus captopril alone,
captopril versus ARB drugs, and captopril versus all ACEI-1 and
ARB drugs.
Results
We had no a priori hypothesis regarding which of the ACEIs
or ARBs would be distinct in terms of their ADE proﬁle. After
analysis, captopril alone showed a clear signal distinct from
other ACEIs and ARBs. Therefore, we proceeded with some
speciﬁc, pairwise analysis of captopril to see if any other distinctions were found. Thirteen different pulmonary ADEs were
selected to assess the related variation due to adverse event
differences. Percent incidence of reported pulmonary ADEs for
each drug can be found in Figure 1. These values represent the
number of reported adverse events for that speciﬁc drug and
ADE as compared with all (pulmonary and nonpulmonary)
ADEs reported for that drug. Results of the Friedman test
showed that all 4 comparative analyses were statistically signiﬁcant except the ACEI-1 drugs versus ARB drugs comparison
(P ¼ 0.07), suggesting that ACEIs (excluding captopril) and
ARBs may have similar pulmonary ADE proﬁles in patients
with diabetes (Table 1). The Friedman test results also showed
that captopril had statistically signiﬁcant increases in pulmonary ADEs in patients with diabetes as compared with other
ACEIs (P ¼ 0.005) as well as compared with ARBs (P ¼ 0.012).
For multiple comparisons among all the groups using this test,
captopril versus all ACEI-1 drugs versus ARB drugs, a P value of
0.004 was seen indicating statistically signiﬁcant differences in
pulmonary ADE occurrences for the 2 drug groups compared
with captopril. Our results highlight a statistically signiﬁcant
difference of pulmonary ADEs for captopril, an ACEI, but also
noted additional pulmonary ADEs of concern with other ACEIs
and ARBs as well (Supplementary Figures 1 and 2).
To meet PRR reporting requirements, 3 criteria must be
satisﬁed: (1) more than 3 reported incidences, (2) a PRR greater
than 2, and (3) a PRR that is greater than the lower 95% CI
boundary, with the lower CI itself being over 1. After applying
these criteria, captopril had reportable incidences for most of
the reported pulmonary ADEs in patients with diabetes. Other
drugs, including ARBs, met the criteria for some pulmonary
ADEs (Supplementary Table 1) but did not show the same
trends across multiple ADEs as depicted with captopril.
Discussion

Friedman test results
Sample differences among the 3 groups, captopril, ACEIs,
and ARBs, were assessed for a pairwise analysis with the
assumption that data were not normally distributed using the

Evaluation of the collated databases revealed that captopril,
the ﬁrst ACEI approved back in 1981, has a higher incidence of
pulmonary ADEs in patients with diabetes as compared with
other ACEI drugs (P ¼ 0.005) as well as a statistically signiﬁcant
difference in pulmonary events compared with ARBs
(P ¼ 0.012) (Table 1).

Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System and Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities databases organized by drug. Abbreviations used: ACEIs,
angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors; ADEs, adverse drug effects; ARBs, angiotensin II receptor blockers.

Captopril’s high incidence of pulmonary ADEs highlights
the fact that the drugs belonging in one class are not identical
and that its pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics can
affect the patients’ health especially during acute processes
like COVID-19. This is especially important as current observational studies of COVID-19 patients tend to group drugs
within a class and are not analyzing the potential differences
within each class. ACEIs can be broadly classiﬁed into 3
structural classes: sulfhydryl-, dicarboxyl-, and phosphorouscontaining molecules. Notably, captopril is the only currently
available ACEI belonging to the sulfhydryl-containing class and
may explain the higher incidence of ADEs observed.5 The
binding of ACEIs to ACE has shown notable differences when
modeled via Autodock Vina14 and maybe a source of variation
in reported ADEs, though this remains under examination.

binding afﬁnity may also explain the pulmonary ADE differences between captopril and other ACEIs and ARBs. For
example, captopril has an inhibitory constant (Ki) of 1.7 nM, a
measurement used to describe the potency of an inhibitor to
its target, as compared with enalapril’s Ki of 0.2 nM.5 Finally,
we have focused this discussion on how these pulmonary
ADEs may affect COVID-19 morbidity and mortality; however,
it is useful to consider how these RAS antagonists, when given
to diabetics, may affect the management of other pulmonary
diseases (e.g., COPD, pneumonia).
Health care providers have been left with many questions
when treating patients with COVID-19, including how ACEIs or
ARBs may affect their clinical course.15 Results from this study
may be helpful when prescribing or continuing ACEIs or ARBs
for patients with diabetes and infections or illnesses that may
affect pulmonary function, such as COVID-19. This research
highlights the important caveat that generalizations cannot
always be safely made to a medication class, and health care
providers should be well aware of nuances between each drug
and how it may contribute to the clinical course of infections,
particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic. The complexity of
considering each drug that the patient is taking and how it
affects both chronic and acute illnesses emphasizes the beneﬁt
a pharmacistdthe medication expertdhas on a patient’s care
team and ultimately the patient’s health outcomes.
Forthcoming 1DATA consortium studies include analysis of
electronic medical records to evaluate the prevalence of ACEIs
or ARBs in patients with COVID-19, and to elucidate if patients

on speciﬁc medications were more likely to have a difﬁcult
clinical course. In addition, evaluation of the binding afﬁnity
and structure-activity relationship of captopril may help
explain why it is responsible for a disproportional amount of
pulmonary ADEs in patients with diabetes.
Limitations
A limitation of this analysis relates to it being a retrospective analysis of curated ADE databases from spontaneous
reporting systems. Nuances in reporting ADEs between FAERS
and MedDRA databases could have resulted in the exclusion or
inclusion of data that may have affected our datasets.
Conclusion
Statistical analysis suggests that the ACEI, captopril, has a
statistically signiﬁcantly different ADE proﬁle for pulmonaryrelated events than ARBs as well as other ACEIs. However,
there are considerable inter- and intraclass variations across
other individual RAS drugs, suggesting that these also merit
attention.
