Typical antipsychotics are easily expressed as adverse events such as extrapyramidal symptom (EPS). On the other
hand, incidence of adverse events due to atypical antipsychotics is low. Therefore, currently, atypical antipsychotics are
widely used to treat schizophrenia. However, it has been reported that there is no diŠerence in the frequency of EPS in
atypical and typical antipsychotics. This study aimed to evaluate the expression proˆle of EPS in atypical and typical antipsychotics treatment using the Japanese Adverse Drug Event Report (JADER) database. We analyzed reports of EPS
in the JADER database and calculated the reporting odds ratio (ROR) of antipsychotics potentially associated with
EPS. We applied the Weibull shape parameter to time-to-event data in the JADER database. Consequently, there was
little information to distinguish between the ROR of atypical and typical antipsychotics. A signiˆcant diŠerence related
to the time of onset of EPS in both antipsychotics was not recognized. However, when comparing each drug, Paliperidone, Perospirone, Blonanserin, and Aripiprazole were relatively developed as EPS in the early stage. On the other
hand, Risperidone, Clozapine, Olanzapine, and Quetiapine were developed as EPS not only at an early stage but also after long-term use. In addition, this ˆnding was suggested from the result of the cumulative incidence of EPS in each drug
and of the time-to-onset analysis using Weibull distribution. These ˆndings may contribute to future clinical practice because we revealed the expression proˆle of EPS in treatment with atypical and typical antipsychotics.

INTRODUCTION
Antipsychotics have been used as drug therapy for
psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia.1) In
general, antipsychotics are classiˆed as atypical and
typical antipsychotics. Typical antipsychotics such as
chlorpromazine and haloperidol show the eŠect
against positive symptoms suggesting dopamine
metabolism abnormality such as hallucination and
disorganized thinking. However, they do not show
much eŠect on negative symptoms such as ‰attening
of emotion and lack of motivation. In addition, typical antipsychotics are easily expressed as adverse
events such as extrapyramidal symptom (EPS). On
the other hand, atypical antipsychotics are highly
eŠective against negative symptoms compared with
typical antipsychotics. In addition, incidences of adverse events such as EPS due to atypical antipsychotics are low.26) Therefore, currently, atypical antipsychotics are expected to improve adherence and quality
of life and have been widely used as a drug therapy
e-mail: kose.eiji＠nihon-u.ac.jp

for schizophrenia.1,7) However, in recent years, it has
also been reported that there is no diŠerence in the
frequency of EPS in atypical and typical
antipsychotics.810) Therefore, in future, we should
fully consider the magnitude of the risk related to expression of EPS due to the type of antipsychotic.
The use of the drug in clinical practice is very complex and is diŠerent from epidemiological study or
clinical trials that have been well-designed. Furthermore, the analysis of the adverse events that occur after a long time period and of infrequent adverse
events is di‹cult to assess in pre-approval clinical trials of drug. In recent years, the detection of unknown
adverse event or the safety assessment that re‰ects the
utilization in clinical practice was performed by large
adverse event spontaneous reporting database
(SRS).1115) Adverse event reports of approximately
370000 cases (from April 2004 to October 2015) have
been registered in Japanese Adverse Drug Event
Report (JADER) database that the Pharmaceuticals
and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA) has been published. The JADER database is the largest and bestknown database, and it re‰ects the realities of clinical

112

practice. Therefore, JADER database has been recognized as one of the primary tools for pharmacovigilance assessments. Analysis of time-to-onset
data has been proposed as a method to detect signals
for adverse drug reactions (ADRs) in SRS. To the
best of our knowledge, analyses of the time-to-onset
for EPS using the JADER database are rare. The aim
of this study was to evaluate the expression proˆle of
EPS due to atypical and typical antipsychotics using
JADER database.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Construction of Database
We used JADER
database (from April 2004 to October 2015), which is
ADRs database of PMDA as a data source. JADER
database were downloaded from the PMDA website
(http://www.pmda.go.jp). The database consists of
four data tables: patient demographic information
(demo), drug information (drug), adverse events
(reac), and primary disease (hist). We used Access
2013the (Microsoft) to connect and make a database of each table. It is known that duplicate report
that exists in SRS has an impact on the evaluation and
analysis. Therefore, in this study, we removed the
duplicate reports based on ``demo'' ˆle and extracted
only the latest of adverse event reports. In addition,
we excluded data on age, which was missing in the
JADER database, because we analyzed the distribution rate of onset separated by age related to EPS.
The age that have been reported in JADER database
are displayed for each 10's. Therefore, we excluded
the data which speciˆc age is unknown such as
``child'' or ``elderly''. The ``drug'' ˆle (drug information) includes role codes assigned to each drug:
suspected drug (higiyaku in Japanese), interacting
drug (sougosayou in Japanese), and concomitant
drug (heiyouyaku in Japanese). However, ``concomitant drug'' is an unknown speciˆc causal connection between the adverse events. Furthermore, it is
quite unlikely that ``interacting drug'' is expressed by
only the appropriated drug. Therefore, in this study,
we excluded ``concomitant drug'' and ``interacting
drug'' data and analyzed only ``suspected drug''.
Analyzed Drugs and Adverse Event Names
The
drugs selected for this investigation were eight atypical antipsychotics and seventeen typical antipsychotics approved in Japan (Table 1). Adverse event
names of JADER database are based on High Level
Group Term (HLGT), High Level Term (HLT), and

Outcome Item
The method which quantify
safety signal to obtain useful information from SRS
which having a huge amount of information is
known.11) Therefore, in this study, we used reporting
odds ratios (ROR) to evaluate safety of SRS.
``Cases'' were deˆned as patients who were reported
EPS, while ``non-cases'' consisted of patients associated with all other reports. The ROR is the odds
ratio of reporting adverse events versus all other

events associated with antipsychotics compared to the
reporting odds for all other drugs present in the database. To compare the ``cases'' and ``non-cases'', we
calculated the RORs as (a: c)/(b: d) (Table 2).
RORs were expressed as point estimates with a 95％
conˆdence interval (CI). For signal detection, general qualitative judgments were used. The signal detection was dependent on the signal indices exceeding a
predeˆned threshold. ROR values ＜1 indicated no
exposure-event association, and estimates ＞1 indicated exposure-event safety signals. Safety signals are
considered signiˆcant when the ROR estimates and
the lower limits of the corresponding 95％ CI are
＞1.16,17) In addition, we extracted the age that adverse events were expressed according to age from
``demo'' ˆle. We calculated the distribution ratio of
the number of reports in each age that were divided
from under 10 years old to 100's. JADER database
has the beginning of the time of a subject's ˆrst
prescription and time of the occurrence of the adverse
events. We calculated the period from the beginning
of the time of a subject's ˆrst prescription to the occurrence of the adverse events in every each drugs.
Moreover, we performed the time-to-onset analysis
using Weibull distribution and we examined the expression proˆle of adverse events for each drug.18)
DiŠerent atypical and typical antipsychotics were not
administered at the same time. For duplicate entries
of the same atypical and typical antipsychotics in the
same case, we adopted the most recent atypical and
typical antipsychotics entry in order to identify the
beginning of the time of a subject's ˆrst prescription.
In addition, we excluded the data lacking either yearmonth-day. The Weibull shape parameter (WSP) test
is used for statistical analysis of time-to-onset data

113

and can describe the non-constant rate of the incidence of ADRs (i.e., the risk of increase or decrease
over time). The shape parameter b of the Weibull distribution indicated that the hazard was without a
reference population; when b is equal to 1 (random
failure), the hazard is estimated to be constant over
time. If b is greater than 1 (wear out failure) and the
95％ CI of b excluded the value 1, the hazard was
considered to increase over time. If b is less than 1
(early failure), the hazard was considered to increase
at an early stage, but then decreases.19) Plots of the
cumulative incidence of EPS in each drug were constructed by the Kaplan-Meier method and were compared. All data analyses were performed by JMP
Pro12.0 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary).
RESULTS
The Number of Reports during the Follow-up
Period
The JADER database contains 369951
reports from April 2004 to October 2015. The number
of excluded reports in which sex or age were missing
was 9897 or 22954 reports, respectively. All adverse
events except for the missing reports were 907679
reports. Among them, the number of reports on adverse events with atypical and typical antipsychotics
as the suspected drug was 14330 and 7948 reports,
respectively. In addition, among all the drugs, the
number of reports with EPS as the adverse events was
6549 reports.
Comparison of the ROR of Extrapyramidal Symptoms with Antipsychotics
Tables 3 and 4 show
the comparison of the ROR related to EPS with antipsychotics. The RORs (95％ CI) of EPS with anti13.25) in the atypical
psychotics were 12.37 (11.54
15.23) in the typical
antipsychotics and 14.05 (12.95
antipsychotics. Safety signal was observed in the
atypical and typical antipsychotics, excluding Spiperone, Nemonapride, and Mosapramine. There were no
reports about EPS in these three drugs. The RORs of
Risperidone, Pariperidone, Perospirone, and Blonanserin were higher than Haloperidol, high-potency antipsychotics. The RORs of Clozapine, Olanzapine,
and Quetiapine, and Aripiprazole were lower than
Chlorpromazine, low-potency antipsychotics.11)

reports in atypical antipsychotics and 157 reports in
typical antipsychotics. The median of the time of onset related to EPS was 38 and 15 d in atypical and
typical antipsychotics, respectively (Fig. 2). The median of time of onset related to EPS by atypical antipsychotics, Risperidone, Paliperidone, Perospirone,

Blonanserin, Clozapine, Olanzapine, Quetiapine, and
Aripiprazole was 77 d, 14 d, 10 d, 21 d, 71 d, 148 d,

In the cumulative incidence rate of EPS in each drug
using the Kaplan-Meier method, among the atypical
antipsychotics, Paliperidone was the earliest expressed EPS and Olanzapine was the slowest expressed EPS. Among the typical antipsychotics, EPS

The Weibull distribution parameters for each antipsychotics are summarized in Table 5. The lower 95％
CI of b for Clozapine almost equaled 1, but those for
other antipsychotics were less than 1 (Table 5).
DISCUSSION
The most important ˆndings of this study were that
the risk of EPS in atypical and typical antipsychotics

was almost identical because RORs of both drugs
were almost identical. In addition, we represented in
detail the expression proˆle of EPS using SRS with
regard to each drug of atypical and typical antipsychotics. To the best of our knowledge, there are few
reports related to the expression proˆle of EPS using
SRS. Therefore, we considered the results obtained in
this study to be novel ˆndings.

Otani et al. predicted the expression of drug-induced Parkinsonism with anti-psychotics on the basis
of dopamine D1, D2, and mACh receptor
occupancy.20) In addition, the package insert of each
drugs described the expression rate of EPS. While the
expression rate such as akathisia and Parkinsonism
due to atypical antipsychotics represents less than 0.1
5％, those of typical antipsychotics represent more
than 5％. In other words, in the package insert, the
expression risk of EPS is higher in typical antipsychotics than in atypical antipsychotics. These expres-

sion rates are based on clinical trial results and have
high reliability. Even if adverse events which were already described in the package insert, no signiˆcant
diŠerences in the RORs, which are related to EPS,
were observed between atypical and typical antipsychotics. Therefore, we suggest that the expression rate
of EPS due to atypical and typical antipsychotics is
almost identical and requires attention when administrating.
One study reported that Risperidone signiˆcantly
aŠects the dopamine D2 receptor on an equal footing

with Haloperidol.21) Compared with Haloperidol, the
incidence of EPS in Perospirone is low and symptoms
are relatively mild.22) The incidence of EPS due to
Blonanserin is lower than that due to Haloperidol.23)
Similar to a previous study,21) from the analysis of
safety signal in this study, Risperidone showed the expression risk on an equal footing with Haloperidol.
However, this study was diŠerent from Hosomi et al.
report24) about Paliperidone, Perospirone, and
Blonanserin. While we have analyzed only the ``suspected drug'' reports, Hosomi et al. have analyzed
both the ``suspected drug'' and ``interacting drug''.
Thus, we suggest the possibility that the diŠerence of
the target data for analysis aŠects the results.
Quetiapine and Olanzapine show low incidence of
EPS compared with Risperidone.25) Clozapine very
slightly expressed EPS.14,25) From the analysis of safety signal in this study, we obtained results supported
by previous studies.14,25) In the analysis of SRS, there
are no standard criteria in the value of safety signals.
In addition, the value of the safety signal is not
proportional with the possibility of the expression of
adverse events. However, our results from JADER
database have suggested a similar tendency as previously studies.14,21,25) Therefore, we consider that ROR
can be an indication of the quantiˆcation of risk. On
the other hand, we believe that ROR is diŠerent
among atypical antipsychotics because the diŠerences
in a‹nity for the receptor of each drug were aŠected.
In other words, high a‹nity drugs for the receptor increases the expression of EPS, and thus, ROR is also
high.
In the expression age of EPS, according to the survey of serious side eŠects of the Ministry of Health,
Labour and Welfare, the expression age of tardive
dyskinesia and tardive dystonia are seen in approximately 65 and 45 years, respectively. However, in this
study, EPS was observed in a wide range of ages in
both drugs with a central focus on the 40's. Therefore, we suggest that it is di‹cult to obtain the
characteristics of the expression age.
In the time of onset of EPS, according to the survey
of serious side eŠects of the Ministry of Health,
Labour and Welfare, drug-induced Parkinsonism is
often expressed from a few days to several weeks after
the start of administration. In total, 90％ of all
patients have developed this side eŠect within 20 d after the start of administration. Dyskinesia and tardive
akathisia develop from three months onward and

Vol. 137 No. 1 (2017)

acute akathisia develops from three days to two weeks
after start of administration. As shown in Fig. 2, in
this study, we obtained results that roughly support
the survey of serious side eŠects of the Ministry of
Health, Labour and Welfare. Thus, we consider that
a signiˆcant diŠerence related to the time of onset of
EPS in both atypical and typical antipsychotics was
not recognized. However, we should verify for each
drug because pharmacokinetic parameters and a‹nity of receptors for each drug are diŠerent. As shown
in Fig. 3, the diŠerence in the expression of EPS was
observed among each drug. In addition, this ˆnding
was also suggested from the result of the cumulative
incidence related to EPS in each drug shown in Fig. 5.
We believe that until at least 100 d after the start of
administration, SDA and DSS are likely to develop
EPS earlier than MARTA more frequently. On the
other hand, among the typical antipsychotics, the expression rate of EPS was high in order of
Haloperidol, Sulpiride, and Chlorpromazine.
However, there is a case for developing EPS at an early stage with respect to Sulpiride but there is also a
case beyond the 1800 d after the start of administration. Therefore, it is necessary to monitor not only
early stage but also after long-term use.
In recent years, WSP test is useful in evaluations of
the time-to-onset data for adverse events.19,26) As
shown in Table 5, consistent with the results shown
above, all atypical and typical antipsychotics that excluded Clozapine are likely to develop the adverse
events relatively in early stage. We suggest that it is
important to monitor adverse events early in the clinical practice. On the other hand, Clozapine was ``random failure'' type drug. Furthermore, we believed
that the association between EPS and Clozapine is
weak because the ROR of Clozapine is 3.55, which is
a low value. We obtained similar results as the previous study.25,27) Therefore, we suggested that the timeto-onset analysis using Weibull distribution is likely
to be useful to the provision of speciˆc safety
monitoring countermeasure such as monitoring
period of adverse events or the monitoring with a focus on expression period of those. However, we consider that it is also necessary to conduct the detailed
epidemiological study in the future.
It is necessary to carefully understand the limitations of data in order to interpret the results obtained
from the SRS. SRS is not recommended to calculate
the true risk because SRS is lacking in direct informa-

tion (i.e., the number of people using drugs) to be the
denominator. Furthermore, reporting bias (i.e., underreport, safety information, and market trends),
incorrectly input drug name or adverse events, and
lack of basic information (i.e., age or sex) are known
in SRS.11) However, it has been known that there is
an unknown adverse event that cannot be found in a
clinical trial.28) If the ROR signal suggesting the
potential for adverse event is detected from the
JADER database, prospective observational studies
are required in order to verify the hypothesis that
there is an association between drugs and adverse
events. Therefore, we suggested that the SRS can be
an informational source for post-marketing surveillance.
CONCLUSION
We suggested that the results of the present study
can be expected to give back in clinical practice (i.e.,
selection of drugs, early detection and early responses
for adverse events) in the future because we revealed
the expression proˆle of EPS due to atypical and typical antipsychotics.
