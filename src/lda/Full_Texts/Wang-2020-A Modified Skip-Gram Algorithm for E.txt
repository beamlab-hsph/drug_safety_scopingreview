Drug-drug interactions (DDIs) are one of the indispensable factors leading to adverse event reactions. Considering the unique
structure of AERS (Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FDA AERS)) reports, we changed the
scope of the window value in the original skip-gram algorithm, then propose a language concept representation model and
extract features of drug name and reaction information from large-scale AERS reports. The validation of our scheme was tested
and veriﬁed by comparing with vectors originated from the cooccurrence matrix in tenfold cross-validation. In the veriﬁcation
of description enrichment of the DrugBank DDI database, accuracy was calculated for measurement. The average area under the
receiver operating characteristic curve of logistic regression classiﬁers based on the proposed language model is 6% higher than that
of the cooccurrence matrix. At the same time, the average accuracy in ﬁve severe adverse event classes is 88%. These results indicate
that our language model can be useful for extracting drug and reaction features from large-scale AERS reports.

1. Introduction
Drug-drug interactions (DDIs) accounted for over 30% of all
adverse drug events [1]. More serious fact is that large quantity of DDIs manifested after a long period of exposure. As a
result, AERS reports have been served as the cornerstone for
detecting unanticipated interactions. The development of
computational prediction and assessment of DDIs become
attractive to the US FDA and pharmaceutical companies
[2]. Harpaz et al. developed a taxonomy that characterized
the associations and predicted several potential multi-item
drug adverse eﬀects [3]. They revealed that duplicate reports
caused spurious associations. Tatonetti et al. constructed a
drug-reaction frequency matrix and used Fisher’s exact test
for feature extraction from frequency matrices for DDI prediction [4]. Logistic regression was used for classiﬁcation.
Predicted DDIs were signiﬁcantly enriched for known eﬀects.
Cheng and Zhao integrated drug phenotypic, therapeutic,

chemical, and genomic properties to predict DDIs [5]. These
four types of drug-drug similarities were calculated as features of each drug-drug pair for prediction. Five machine
learning algorithms were implemented, and they found that
integration of multidata sources can improve the performance of DDI prediction. Cami et al. proposed a Predictive
Pharmacointeraction Network [6]. They exploited the network structure of all known DDIs, combined with various
taxonomic and intrinsic properties of drugs to predict
unknown DDIs. While these methods performed well, their
limitations are obvious either. From the above, similaritybased methods rely on various proﬁles including drug molecular structure proﬁles, drug-drug interaction proﬁles, and
pharmacophoric proﬁles [7, 8]. First of all, barely any of the
previous work took a systematic data preprocessing method
before taking advantage of AERS reports; a standard language description framework should be used to organize all
the reports. Second, in the face of the large amount of free

2

text reports, to solve the problem that the integration of
proﬁles cost large amount of manually check and selection
biases, a language concept representation model is urgently
needed. Third, the existing approaches do not seem to
extract features from AERS reports eﬃciently and to test
the quality of the new-mined DDI concept by our MSG
model, which also are needed to be distinguished in the
DrugBank database.
The skip-gram algorithm was one of the language models
set in the open-source word2vec [9, 10]. This algorithm was
used to render distributional representation of words from
large-scale unmarked text. The skip-gram algorithm has been
widely acknowledged and successfully applied to many natural language processing tasks, such as text clustering, entity
completion in incomplete knowledge bases or ontologies,
and text retrieval [11–13]. At the same time, there are few
researchers focusing on applying this language model to mining the pharmacovigilance information from large-scale
reports in free text format.
The main contribution of this work can be listed as
follows:
(1) We proposed a new language concept representation
model by changing the scope of the window value in
the original skip-gram algorithm
(2) Compared to the previous traditional language
model, the new model can extract features of drug
name and reaction information from large-scale
AERS reports more eﬃciently
(3) The new drug-drug interaction datasets can be mined
through the use of the proposed MSG language concept representation model

2. Method
As shown in Figure 1, in the whole research scheme, we
proposed a modiﬁed skip-gram (MSG) algorithm for drug
name and reaction description feature extraction from
FDA AERS reports, and the description of DDIs in DrugBank was enriched.
In Step 1, original free text AERS reports are transformed
into structured tables (Figure 1(a)). Our study refers to the
framework of OHDSI (Observational Health Data Sciences
and Informatics) and puts Banda et al.’s research into practice, completing the cleaning and standardization of AERS
reports [14, 15]; all the structured tables are stored in a PostgreSQL database. In addition, we extracted DrugBank DDI
and toxicity data into text ﬁles as shown in Figure 1(b).
In Step 2, the MSG algorithm was applied to calculate
the embeddings of drug name and reaction descriptions
from AERS reports and DrugBank DDI. The vectors with
a dimension of 100 were represented as features of drug
name and reaction description. All the names of drugs
and reactions are converted from string to the numbers
as shown in Figure 1(c). For example, one drug name is
represented as a drug concept ID 1327356 with 100
dimension separated numbers.

In Step 3, a logistic regression classiﬁer was used to validate the above embedding values. To compare the quality
of embeddings generated from MSG, CM-TF-IDF, another
traditional language representation model, was also tested.
We chose to assess the performance of the classiﬁer in comparing the area under the curve (AUROC) of AERS reports
and DrugBank DDI with a cross-validation approach.
Finally, the descriptions of DDIs in ﬁve severe adverse
event classes were enriched into the current adverse event
results.
2.1. Data Collection and Preprocess. We collected AERS
reports from the FDA’s website between 2004 and 2014. In
addition, SIDER was used as the gold standard for positive
reference samples [16]. DDI data and drug toxicity data were
extracted from the DrugBank database [17].
Although it is a free and publicly available resource, the
FDA AERS data still presents multiple hurdles in consolidating all relevant data. To avoid producing unreliable and irreproducible results, widely accepted data preprocessing
methods were referred to and put into practice. Thanks to
the eﬀorts of large communities such as the Observational
Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI) [14], we
can focus more on model building than on lots of timewasted eﬀorts such as cleaning and standardizing the AERS
reports. For details of preprocessing FDA AERS reports, we
referred to Banda et al.’s research [15]. First, AERS reports
in Extensible Markup Language (XML) format were
extracted into seven individual tables; these tables were
loaded onto PostgreSQL. Second, a demo table was created
for missing value imputation and case deduplication. Missing
value imputation was performed on four demographic ﬁelds
(age, sex, country, and event date). As a case may exist in the
legacy AERS dataset or in the new FAERS dataset, diﬀerent
unique row keys were managed in a case deduplication step.
Finally, regular expression was taken as the main method for
mapping drug and reaction concept into the OHDSI standard vocabulary concept identiﬁer (consisting of RxNorm
CUIs and MedDRA standard codes).
After the preprocessing of AERS reports, in total,
4,493,179 reports are achieved, within which 713,441 reports
listed exactly two drugs. To ensure reasonable estimates and
statistical signiﬁcance, at least ten AERS reports are required
to support one given drug concept [18]. We selected ten as
the threshold to ﬁlter out drug concepts in AERS reports.
As a result, 675 drug concepts are ﬁltered out and existed in
DrugBank DDI dataset drug concepts either. These 675
drugs are included in Reference Drug Lists (RDL).
2.2. Modiﬁed Skip-Gram (MSG) Model. The original skipgram algorithm was modiﬁed for drug name and reaction
description feature extraction from FDA AERS reports and
DrugBank DDIs. Based on distributional hypothesis theory
[9], a word can be characterized into an embedding value
by contexts, which are the surrounding words around its
position in the sentence. These embeddings encode the
semantic meanings of the target word into a lowdimensional vector. In this research, all the drugs with reaction words are encoded into a low-dimensional vector. Our

modiﬁed skip-gram model was trained by the hierarchical

[10]. The objective of the skip-gram model is to maximize
the log probability:

ð1Þ

ðw,cÞ∈D w j ∈c

In Equation (1), c is the limited set of drugs and reactions
in one AERS report. When w denotes the drug, w j denotes
the reaction in the report and vice versa. In the equation

above, Pðw ∣ w j Þ can be detailed as follows:

  



ð2Þ

In Equation (2), e ′ ðwÞ is the embedding of drug w (reaction either), w ′ is one of the words in the vocabulary V consisting of drug name and reaction descriptions.
The key diﬀerence between the original skip-gram and
modiﬁed skip-gram is the way we deﬁne “context.” In the

4

Computational and Mathematical Methods in Medicine

original skip-gram, the context is 2n words around the current target word. The 2n words are composed of n words
forward—the current target word—and n words backward.
In default, n is set in ﬁve. According to the particularity
orders of words in drug-drug interaction reports, the context
of each drug name word is every reaction description word
appearing in the sentences of each AERS report in our modiﬁed skip-gram. When it comes to reaction description
words, the context words c are changed into every drug
name word in the corresponding sentences. As shown in
Figure 2, the contexts of Drug1 are Reaction1, Reaction2,
and Reaction3.
2.3. Cooccurrence Matrix Based on Term Frequency-Inverse
Document Frequency (CM-TF-IDF). Term frequencyinverse document frequency (TF-IDF) is well known as a statistical method for evaluating the importance of one word in
the corpus [19]. The importance of the word is increased in
direct proportion to how many times it appears in the ﬁle
and at the same time is declined in inverse proportion to
how many times it appears in the whole corpus. In Equation
(3), ni, j is the time word t i appearing in the ﬁle d j and ∑k nk, j
is the sum of frequencies of all words appearing in the ﬁle d j .
jDj denotes the total number of documents, and jfj : t i ∈ d j gj
is the number of documents which contain the word t i in
the corpus.

ð3Þ

As shown in Figure 3, we constructed a drug name/reaction description report cooccurrence matrix based on
TF-IDF for feature vectorization of drugs and reactions.
For example, if Drugi was recorded in Report2, the element in the matrix is the tﬁdf of Drugi; otherwise, the element is zero.
2.4. Logistic Regression. According to the MSG algorithm,
drug encoded its reaction information into a lowdimensional vector after the MSG training. CM-TF-IDF also
generated drug and reaction vectors from the cooccurrence
matrix. These low-dimensional vectors are rendered as features for identifying whether or not the drug pairs are associated with the adverse event class. As logistic regression has
been widely used in pharmacovigilance and achieved good
performance, it was applied in our research [4–6].
Referring to distinct severe adverse event classes
presented by Tatonetti et al. [4], ﬁve clinically signiﬁcant
adverse event classes are taken into consideration for binary
classiﬁcation and DDI enrichment: Renal Impairment
(REI), Hepatotoxic (HTT), Abnormal Blood Pressure (ABP),
Cardiotoxicity (CDT), and Neurotoxic (NET). The logistic
regression model requires positive and negative labels which
indicate whether or not the pair of drugs is associated with
the adverse event class. Because there is no well-recognized
gold standard for drug-drug interaction, we crosssearched
three datasets (DrugBank_Toxicity, DrugBank_DDI, and

SIDER) and compiled three strategies as follows to deﬁne
the positive reference samples, see Figure 4.
In the ﬁrst strategy, if at least one of the drugs in one
pair existed in SIDER’s speciﬁc drug lists where drugs are
associated with the adverse event, we labeled this pair of
drugs as positive.
In the second strategy, if at least one of the drugs in one
pair manifests as an adverse event-associated toxicity in
DrugBank_Toxicity, we labeled this drug pair as positive.
In the third strategy, according to DrugBank_DDI, if the
pair is known to interact which results in the adverse event,
the pair is labeled as positive.

3. Evaluation and Experiment Results
To assess the performance of the scheme based on MSG, we
compared vectors generated from MSG with CM-TF-IDF.
The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) is used for the
evaluation of binary classiﬁers [20]. To obtain robust estimates, we performed 10-fold cross-validation; the whole
dataset was divided into ten cross-validation splits. During
each cross-validation step, a set of nine cross-validation splits
was used for model training while the tenth sample set was
applied as the test set.
No matter how the embedding was generated, all embedding models are constructed based on the distributional
hypothesis. That is to say, if two words have similar context,
their value of embeddings is close in the low-dimensional
space. Furthermore, the value of drug pair embeddings is theoretically close with its interactions in the low-dimensional
space. As a result, we extended this idea to the enrichment
of DDIs in DrugBank. Cosine between drug pair embeddings and reaction embeddings was calculated as the reference for ranking.
Although the drug and reaction embeddings were generated after the MSG training, there are no explicit drug
pair embeddings. As shown in Equation (3), we empirically
constructed drug pair embeddings by addition. For details
about variables in Equation (3), eDrug1 = ða1 , a2 , ⋯, an Þ and
eDrug2 = ðb1 , b2 , ⋯, bn Þ. ai and bi are the values of each n
dimension of drug embedding. Cosine between drug
pair embedding and reaction embedding was calculated

In summary, we sorted cosine of candidate reactions and
drug pairs. Finally, top 20 candidate reactions were used to
enrich descriptions of DDIs in DrugBank.

In total, 713,441 reports listed only two drugs in FDA
AERS reports and 561,180 DDIs in the DrugBank database.
We only included the record where drug pairs are listed in
RDL. It is worth noting that deduplication of DDIs in DrugBank is also important. As shown in Figures 3(a) and 3(b),
there are two DDIs from DrugBank. These two DDIs actually
represent the same knowledge, so only one of them was kept
for our research. As a result, 218,866 AERS reports and
46,203 DrugBank DDIs were included in our analysis. As
shown in Figure 3(c), 218,866 AERS reports were exported
from PostgreSQL into plain text format for MSG training.

“Gradient calculation” was set to Hierarchical softmax for
performance improvement.
As mentioned in Section 3, ﬁve logistic regression models
required ﬁve sets of samples which consist of positive and
negative labels. The detailed distribution of positive samples
in three datasets (DrugBank_DDI, DrugBank_Toxicity, and
SIDER) is listed in Table 2. In column DrugBank_Toxicity
and SIDER, the number is the positive samples of drugs. In
column DrugBank_DDI, the number is the positive samples
of drug pairs. For example, as shown in Figure 3(d), the DDIs
have the keyword “cardiotoxic”. As a result, the drug pair
<Mitomycin, Cyclophosphamide> was one of the 544 positive samples (Table 2) in Cardiotoxicity (CDT) adverse event
class. In DrugBank_Toxicity dataset, as shown in Figure 3(e),
the report of drug <Interferon Alfa-2a (Recombinant)> has
the keyword “cardiotoxicity”; we included the drug pair as a
positive sample in Cardiotoxicity (CDT) adverse event class
if the drug pair has drug <Interferon Alfa-2a (Recombinant)>. In the SIDER dataset, we marked the drug pair as a
positive sample in Cardiotoxicity (CDT) adverse event class
if the drug pair has the drug listed in 448 manually checked
drugs (Table 2).
3.1. Validation of Logistic Regression Models Based on MSG
and CM-TF-IDF. We trained and validated logistic regression models for Renal Impairment (REI), Hepatotoxic
(HTT), Abnormal Blood Pressure (ABP), Cardiotoxicity
(CDT), and Neurotoxic (NET). When it comes to the vectors
generated from MSG, each one of the ﬁve clinical signiﬁcant
adverse event classes has two logistic regression models based
on AERS reports and the DrugBank DDI dataset individually. When it comes to the vectors generated from CM-TFIDF, ten logistic regression models are also trained like
MSG. In order to avoid dimension disaster of CM-TF-IDF,
principal component analysis (PCA) was used for feature
dimensionality reduction of CM-TF-IDF. The ROC curve
of ﬁve adverse event classes based on MSG and CM-TFIDF is shown in Figures 5 and 6; AUROC of ﬁve adverse
event classes is shown in Figure 7. As shown in Figure 7, ﬁve
logistic regression models based on AERS reports achieved a
higher value of AUROC than ﬁve logistic regression models
based on DrugBank DDIs. All AUROC based on MSG in
Figure 7 are higher than those based on CM-TF-IDF, which
means that our modiﬁed skip-gram model can extract features from AERS reports and DrugBank DDI dataset more
eﬀectively than the traditional statistical method CM-TFIDF. At the same time, logistic regression has a good performance of classiﬁcation in these ﬁve adverse event classes as
we expected.

3.2. Enrichment of DDIs in DrugBank. We calculated the
cosine of 1,650 DrugBank DDIs for description enrichment
and taken MedDRA for veriﬁcation of description enrichment in ﬁve adverse event classes: Renal Impairment (REI),
Hepatotoxic (HTT), Abnormal Blood Pressure (ABP), Cardiotoxicity (CDT), and Neurotoxic (NET).
As we know, there are ﬁve levels in the MedDRA hierarchy, arranged from speciﬁc to general: {System Organ Class
(SOC)}, {High level Group Terms (HLGT)}, {High Level
Terms (HLT)}, {Preferred Term (PT)}, and {Lowest Level
Term (LLT)} [19]. In order to verify the enrichment of DDIs
in DrugBank, twenty-seven {System Organ Class (SOC)} are
taken into our consideration. Taken Neurotoxic (NET) as
example, when we veriﬁed the enrichment of DDIs in Neurotoxic (NET), {Nervous system disorders} in {System Organ
Class (SOC)} is set as gold standard for the right reactions
in Neurotoxic (NET). If at least one of the reactions in top
20 of the drug pair is under the {Nervous system disorders}
category, then we deﬁne the description enrichment of the
drug pair in Neurotoxic (NET) is valid. For example, the
enrichment of drug pair <Digoxin, Epirubicin> in Cardiotoxicity (CDT) class is shown in Table 3. Six bold font reactions are veriﬁed under the {Cardiac disorders} in System
Organ Class (SOC), so the description enrichment of drug
pair <Digoxin, Epirubicin> is valid. Table 4 shows the details
of DDI enrichment of ﬁve classes. In total, 1,456 description
enrichments are veriﬁed valid, and the average accuracy is
0.882424, which means the description of DDIs in DrugBank
is enriched eﬃciently by using MSG model.

4. Discussion
In order to verify and demonstrate the advantage of our presented new scheme, we repeated the whole experiments using
the cooccurrence matrix based on tﬁdf model to generate
drug and adverse feature vectors. From the results of ten
logistic regression models (as shown in Figure 7 the results
show that ﬁve logistic regression models based on AERS
reports all achieved higher value of AUROC than ﬁve logistic
regression models based on DrugBank DDIs. In FDA AERS
datasets, the vectors generated by the MSG can give better
performance in feature extraction than by the tﬁdf-based
cooccurrence matrix model. The main reasons behind the
above results are as follows: (1) the cooccurrence matrix
based on tﬁdf model can cause dimensionality disaster when

the data size is large; some features are bound to be lost when
using the principal component analysis (PCA). The MSG
model deﬁnes the dimension of the space vector at initialization, which avoids the work of secondary feature engineering
and avoids the loss of feature information. (2) The MSG
model constructs a Huﬀman tree based on word frequency
during initialization, and the activation function of each node
is softmax, which greatly shortens the time for updating

weights and vectors in the whole learning process. Because
of these reasons, the MSG model can be applied to largescale datasets compared with the traditional tﬁdf-based cooccurrence matrix and also can quickly perform feature learning. At the same time, we also found that the MSG model
can perform well for the noisy dataset. When MSG model
is applied in DrugBank data, all the noisy data are not specifically cleaned after the alignment of drug and adverse reaction strings. However, from the ﬁve AUROC values (as
shown in Figure 7 DrugB_MSG), the average AUROC values
of the ﬁve major adverse reaction groups are around 0.8,
which shows that the MSG model can also eﬀectively generate feature vectors from the noise dataset.

5. Conclusions
In this work, we proposed an eﬃcient method of feature vector extraction and calculation from FDA AERS and DrugBank texts based on the modiﬁed skip-gram model. Feature
vectors are taken to expand drug-drug interaction datasets
of the DrugBank database. All the accuracy values are higher
than 80% (as shown in Table 4) and show that these new

Computational and Mathematical Methods in Medicine
features are valuable in ﬁve severe adverse event classes. The
contribution of clinicians may accelerate the process of MSG
model application in the clinical ﬁeld.
In the future, on the one hand, we will continue to optimize the accuracy of the word vector and try to integrate
the attention mechanism into the language representation
algorithm, and on the other hand, we are going to apply the
detection of adverse drug reactions to the actual electronic
medical record medication prescription system, so as to
promptly remind doctors and patients when using drugs.
