Abstract
Objective: Drug-drug interaction (DDI) is of serious concern, causing over 30% of all adverse
drug reactions and resulting in significant morbidity and mortality. Early discovery of adverse DDI
is critical to prevent patient harm. Spontaneous reporting systems have been a major resource for
drug safety surveillance that routinely collects adverse event reports from patients and healthcare
professionals. In this study, we present a novel approach to discover DDIs from the Food and Drug
Administration’s adverse event reporting system.

Methods: Data-driven discovery of DDI is an extremely challenging task because higher-order
associations require analysis of all combinations of drugs and adverse events and accurate estimate
of the relationships between drug combinations and adverse event require cause-and-effect
inference. To efficiently identify causal relationships, we introduce the causal concept into
association rule mining by developing a method called Causal Association Rule Discovery
(CARD). The properties of V-structures in Bayesian Networks are utilized in the search for causal
associations. To demonstrate feasibility, CARD is compared to the traditional association rule
mining (AR) method in DDI identification.
Results: Based on physician evaluation of 100 randomly selected higher-order associations
generated by CARD and AR, CARD is demonstrated to be more accurate in identifying known
drug interactions compared to AR, 20% vs. 10% respectively. Moreover, CARD yielded a lower
number of drug combinations that are unknown to interact, i.e., 50% for CARD and 79% for AR.

Author Manuscript

Conclusion: Evaluation analysis demonstrated that CARD is more likely to identify true causal
drug variables and associations to adverse event.

Introduction

Author Manuscript

Each time a person uses a prescription medication, there is a potential for an adverse drug
reaction (ADR). That potential increases with an increase in the number of concurrent
medications being used. Between 2009–2012, about 47% of the United States population
reported they had used at least one prescription medication in the past 30 days and almost
11% reported using at least five prescription medications in the same period. This equated to
approximately $270 billion spent on prescription medications in 2013 [1]. ADRs have been
attributed to cause over 770,000 injuries and 100,000 deaths each year in US [2], resulting in
an annual cost of more than $136 billion [3]. Studies have estimated that drug-drug
interactions (DDIs) may account for up to 30% of all unexpected adverse drug reactions
(ADRs) [4].

Author Manuscript

Adverse DDIs can be preventable if discovered early. Unfortunately, it is extremely difficult
to study DDIs before market approval. During premarketing surveillance, new drugs can
only be tested for interactions with existing drugs using in vivo and in vitro methods [5].
However, drugs can interact in many different ways [6], it is infeasible to examine every
possible type of interaction for all drug combinations [7]. Additionally, many DDIs require
certain amount of exposure to manifest and rare DDIs may take several exposures to occur
[8]. Therefore, postmarketing surveillance becomes necessary for the early detection of
unexpected adverse DDIs in the general population.
To facilitate postmarketing drug safety surveillance, the United States Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) established the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) to
collect ADR reports from healthcare professionals, patients, and pharmaceutical
manufacturers [9]. Similarly at international level, the World Health Organization (WHO) is

maintaining a large database of ADR reports, VigiBase [10]. These data provide a significant
opportunity to study ADRs computationally. Numerous signal detection algorithms were
designed for identifying relationships between drugs and adverse events (AEs) in
spontaneous reports. Despite the number of existing algorithms, all have drawbacks that
limit their effectiveness, such as noisy results with diminishing accuracy and low robustness
due to low signal-to-noise ratio, high dimensionality of the data, and limited sample sizes.
The algorithms are largely based on the statistical disproportionality theory such as relative
reporting ratio (RR) to quantify the degree of unexpectedness of a relationship [9, 11, 12].
Both the FDA and WHO utilize adjusted versions of for flagging potential ADRs [13, 14].
These algorithms primarily focus on binary relationships consisting of one drug and one AE,
e.g., cerivastatin → muscle injury [15, 16, 17, 18].

Author Manuscript

To find higher-order relationships raised by DDIs, e.g., aspirin + warfarin → bleeding,
methods have been developed and evaluated on subsets of drugs and specific AEs in the
spontaneous reporting systems [19, 20, 21]. For instance, van Puijenbroek et al. used logistic
regression analysis to examine the influence of combined use of itraconazole and oral
contraceptives on delayed withdrawal bleeding [19] and diuretics and non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs on symptoms indicating decreased efficacy of diuretics [21]. Thakrar et
al. [20] investigated two statistical models in detecting four known DDIs and Tatonetti et al.
[22, 23] built profiles for eight clinically important AEs based on side effects of drugs
known to produce them and predicted potential interactions by searching for drug pairs that
match the profiles. Furthermore, Harpaz et al. [24, 25] employed association rule mining and
bi-clustering algorithms to infer associations between drug combinations and adverse event.

Author Manuscript

Among the existing pharmacovigilance studies, associations are the most studied
relationships. However, an association does not necessarily imply causality [26]. Causal
relationships do not only indicate two variables are related, but also how they are related and
interacted. One step further, the causal mechanism ensures changes in causal variable
directly caused changes in the effect variable. For example, we do not only want to know a
particular drug is associated with renal failure, but also we want to know definitively
whether the association is due to an adverse reaction or a disease. Without knowing the true
relationship, plain associations can lead to false conclusions, e.g., the drug causes renal
failure.

Author Manuscript

Causality is at the center stage of biomedical research and work on how to identify it has
primarily taken a pragmatic approach with randomized controlled trials (RCTs) being
treated as the gold standard for causal inference; however RCT methods have many wellknown limitations [27, 28, 29]. Experiments are also frequently infeasible due to legal,
ethical and practical constraints – no one would randomly assign individuals to smoke to
assess its health risks. Instead, large-scale observational datasets on a population can be an
indispensable resource for causal inference. Despite significant advances in causal discovery
theory that have enabled the computational modeling and learning of causal structures from
data [30, 31, 32, 33], application of causal discovery algorithms is seriously hindered by its
high computational cost [34] and its strict causal mechanism assumption [31, 32]. In
addressing the challenge, researchers have proposed constraint-based causal discovery
methods, instead of searching for a complete Bayesian network they aim to learn local

casual structures such as the Markov blanket [35, 36, 37], V-structures [38], causal cut [39].
As association rule mining (AR) has been demonstrated to be versatile in exploring
relationships in large datasets, researchers have attempted to take advantage of AR for causal
discovery by manipulating observational data as in retrospective cohort studies [40, 41].
In this study, we aim to investigate whether it is feasible to augment AR to discover causal
rules for DDI identification. Our study differs from prior related studies in the following
aspects: (1) we propose a Causal Association Rule Discovery (CARD) method by exploiting
the properties of V-structures in CBN to guide the causal association rule search; (2) to our
knowledge, this is the first CBN-based causal discovery framework for identifying DDIs and
their causal relationships to adverse events.

Materials and Methods
Author Manuscript

Preparation of datasets.
We collected a large sample of spontaneous reports published between the years of 2004 to
2012 from FAERS that are categorized as having a “serious” patient outcome. In other
words, only reports with outcome codes listed in Table 1 are included in the study.
Additionally, we restricted our mining process to reports with mentions of at least two drugs;
focusing our study on detecting adverse effects corresponding to drug combinations.
Furthermore, we excluded duplicated reports and limited the analysis to drugs and AEs that
occurred in at least five “serious” reports. The overall process is depicted in Figure 1 and
following sections describe each key step in detail.

Author Manuscript

Entity standardization.—Drug names in FAERS are entered as free-text in a variety of
forms. For example, the antidiabetic drug metformin can be entered as Fortamet, Diaben/
metformin, Diabex metformin hydrochloride, and etc. The terms can also contain dose or
route information, e.g., “500mg metformin”, and active ingredient information, e.g.,
“Competact (pioglitaxone / metformin hydrochloride)”. To codify the medications, we used
MedEx [42] to extract drug names out of the free-text terms and mapped each to a generic
drug concept in RxNorm. When textual terms contain multiple active ingredients, the
mapping was done separately for individual ingredient. Drug names that could not be
mapped were still included in the analysis in their original form. Drug names can also be
entered as a specific drug or a drug class, for example, aspirin vs. analgesics. Although
aspirin falls under the analgesic class, we did not attempt to make the translation, so they are
included as separate entities. Since adverse outcome reported in FAERS are already coded
using the MedDRA terminology [43] (a terminology developed for adverse drug event
applications), we treated each coded AE as a unique entity.

Author Manuscript

Duplicate report removal.—Studies [44, 45] have suggested that FAERS may contain
5% to 20% duplicated reports, introducing sample bias that may result in spurious signals.
FDA utilizes a proprietary algorithm to remove duplicates for analysis. As an alternative,
other studies have instead searched for reports with at least eight drugs or AEs and
determined reports as duplicate if they match on all the reported drugs, AEs, and patient
demographic information [24, 25]. Setting the threshold at eight is to minimize the

probability of a match by chance. Our study adopted this approach in removing duplicated
reports.
Dataset statistics.—Statistics on FAERS reports published between 2004 and 2012 are
shown in Table 2. The full set contains 4,509,229 reports. After excluding reports with nonserious outcome and duplicates, only 41.88% of the original set remained. Additionally, we
removed reports that have no AE information and those only contain drugs and AEs
appearing in less than 5 reports, reducing the sample size to 1,886,749 reports; covering
7,701 unique generic drug names (reduced from 351,980 unique textual entries) and 11,569
MedDRA coded AEs.
Association rule mining (AR).

Author Manuscript

Association rule mining is a well-established data mining method for discovering
relationships in data and its algorithmic variations have been developed for ADR detection
[24, 40, 46]. An association rule is an implication expression of the form A → B, where A
and B are two event sets that do not share any common events. In the case of ADR detection,
A denotes a set of drugs and B denotes a set of AEs, e.g., A = (cerivastatin) → B = (muscle
injury). An event set can contain one or more items, multi-item associations. For example, A
= (aspirin + warfarin) → B = (Bleeding) indicates taking aspirin and warfarin together is
associated with the bleeding.

Author Manuscript

To assess the strength of an association rule, the best-known measures are support and
confidence. Support of an association rule S(A→ B) is the proportion of records in which A
and B both appear. Confidence of an association rule C(A→ B) is the probability P(B|A) of
finding the consequent B given the antecedent A. Therefore, support measures the
unexpectedness of the rule and confidence measures the reliability of the rule. These two
measures allow the screening of interesting rules from a set of all possible rules. An
interesting association rule is required to satisfy user-specified minimum thresholds on
support and confidence at the same time. The AR method described in Harpaz et al. [24] is
implemented in this study as the baseline algorithm for comparison and the relative
reporting ratio (RR) is used accordingly as the proxy for measuring rule strength rather than
the traditional confidence.
Causal association rule discovery (CARD).

Author Manuscript

As associations may not indicate causal relationships, our study aims to detect true causal
relationships between drug combinations (drug-drug interactions) and adverse events by
proposing a new method called causal association rule discovery (CARD). Given a set of
spontaneous reports in the FAERS database, S = [s1,s2, ⋯,sm], let D = [d1,d2, ⋯ ,dn] be the
binary indicators of the drugs taken, where di represents whether a patient has taken the ith
drug or not. Let be a binary indicator of the occurrence of an AE and s j = [d1j , d2j , ⋯, dnj, y j]

represents an ADR report j. Let Ii denote the event that ith drug is taken (di = 1) and A
denote the event that an AE has occurred (y = 1), then an AE triggered by a drug-drug
interaction (DDI) can be formulated as an association rule, Ii1 Ii2 ⋯ Iik → A. As the study
focuses on DDIs, only rules with k ≥ 2 are considered. To formalize the concept of causal

association rules, we derive important properties from Causal Bayesian Network (CBN) and
develop an efficient search method.
In the simplest DDI case, a CBN of three variables {d1, d2, y} with {d1, d2} being the
possible causes and y being the effect has four primitive local structures as shown in Figure
2. Figure 2a, 2b, and 2c are independent-equivalent BNs because they entail the same set of
conditional independence relationships. In other words, variable d1 is conditionally
independent of variable d2 given variable (i.e. d1 ⊥ d2|y). However, Figure 2d implies a
different assertion that d1 is conditionally dependent of d2 given y, referred to as the VStructure in BN, which is well known and studied in inductive causation methods [26].

Author Manuscript

In contrast to other CBN local structures, V-structure is more robust and discriminating in
causality identification problems because it is not statistically equivalent to any other
structures involving the same variables. It is the only local structure that can be used to
confirm the direction of causal relationships. If a true V-structure forms as in Figure 2d, the
two drugs involved must be interacting to cause AE. From the statistical aspect, the
following statistical independence relation holds for all the V-structures, 1) d1 ⊥ d2|D′ holds
and 2d1 ⊥ d2|D′ ∪ {y} does not hold, where D′ ⊂ D − {di1, di2}. Based on the above
essential properties of V-structure, we derived the following causal association interesting
measure (CAIM) for Ii1 Ii2 → A.
CAIM I i1I i2

A = N(d i1, y) + N(d i2, y) − N(d i1, d i2) + N(d i1, d i2 y)

(1)

Author Manuscript

Here, N( di1, y) denotes the normalized mutual information [47]. A high CAIM score
indicates that both d1, d2 are highly associated with y, i.e. the role of N( di1, y ) + N( di2, y),
and previously non-associated d1, d2 became highly associated given y, i.e. the role of
−N( di1, di2) + N( di1, di2| y).
For the rule I → A with more than three antecedents, any sub-rules containing two
antecedents must also form a V-structure with the adverse event, di1 → y ← di2. Because
the interestingness of rule I → A is dependent on the weakness of its sub-rules, the
generalized interestingness measure is defined as follows.
CAIM(I

To efficiently search through the large space of all possible rules and estimate
interestingness of the rules, we derived a pruning strategy based on properties of Vstructures and an incremental updating strategy for CAIM. Algorithm details are available in

Results
Performance evaluation.
Following common practice in pharmacovigilance studies in evaluating clinical validity of
DDIs [15, 16, 24], we randomly selected 100 rules identified by CARD and presented them
to a pharmacist for manual review. The pharmacist used both Micromedex and Epocrates
[48, 49] as the clinical reference and settled any disagreements by checking with UpToDate
[50]. The pharmacist and a physician also helped us in characterizing the identified rules
with a taxonomy developed based on observations. For algorithm performance comparison,
we implemented the AR method as presented in Harpaz et al. [24] that was shown to be
effective in identifying higher-order associations, and performed the same analysis on its
100 randomly selected findings.

Higher-order drug-event relationship identification.
For the baseline AR algorithm, we aligned this study with the study in [24] by setting AR
thresholds at minimum support of 100 and RR of 2. The minimum support and RR
thresholds were observed to be a balancing point between the number of rules generated and
variation in content (e.g., drugs and AEs in the rules). Low thresholds will result in large set
of rules with many false positives. High thresholds, on the other hand, will result in less
variation in content. Using the proposed thresholds, AR in total produced 424 higher-order
association rules with combinations containing at least 2 drugs and among them 57
contained 3 or more drugs. Analogously, CARD also used minimum support of 100 and the
CAIM score threshold was set at ≥0.04 to produce similar number of rules (i.e., 457) and
among which 10 contained 3 or more drugs (e.g., an identified combination included
doxorubicin hydrochloride, prednisone, and rituximab).

Author Manuscript

From the identified drug-event relationships, we randomly selected 100 for validation and
developed a taxonomy from the analysis. The taxonomy characterizing drugs and
associations along with the proportions of each category in the 100 randomly sampled
findings is presented in Table 3. It contains observed proportions for both AR and CARD.
Table 4 provides the taxonomy that characterizes the rules along with its proportion in each
category and representative examples.

Author Manuscript

Known drug interactions.—Among the 100 randomly sampled findings, CARD
identified more drug combinations known to interact compared to AR, 20% vs. 10%. Further
analysis suggested that 6 of the 20 CARD identified known interacting drug combinations
cause the indicated AE (i.e., true positive DDI→AE associations). For example, CARD
identified (amiodarone + warfarin) increases the international normalized ratio (INR) which
is supported by evidence. This interaction is highly clinically significant and the risk of
interaction often outweighs the benefit. As another example, (nitroglycerin + rosiglitazone)
→ myocardial infarction was identified by CARD and literature evidence also indicates that
the combination should be avoided as it may increase the risk of myocardial ischemia.
The remaining 14 of the 20 interacting combinations identified by CARD are not currently
known to cause the indicated AE as an interaction effect but one or both drugs in the

Artif Intell Med. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2019 March 28.

Cai et al.

Page 8

Author Manuscript

combination can still relate to the AE as known side-effects (i.e., Table 4 – taxonomy 1a).
For example, the combination (prednisone + rosiglitazone) was identified to be associated
with cardiac failure congestive. Existing evidence indicates that the combination have
antagonistic effects where efficacy of the hypoglycemic agent, rosiglitazone, is decreased
because prednisone can cause hyperglycemia. Thus cardiac failure congestive is not known
to be a direct effect of the interaction; however it is a cardiovascular side-effect of
prednisone due to long-term fluid retention and other direct vascular effects.
Another category of association for known interacting combinations is illustrated by the
taxonomy 1b where the identified AEs were unknown. CARD did not retrieve any of these
pairs, but AR found 3. For example, prior clinical knowledge suggests that using cilostazol
together with analgesics like aspirin may increase risk of bleeding, but not dyspnea as shown
in Table 4.

Author Manuscript

Unknown drug interactions.—CARD yielded a lower number of drug combinations
unknown to interact, i.e., 50% for CARD vs. 79% for AR. Among the 50 false positives by
CARD, 37 (74%) are related to the identified AE through one or both drugs (Table 4 –
taxonomy 4-a). For instance, no evidence supports interaction between celecoxib and
metformin, but the identified AE myocardial infarction is related to celecoxib. In contrast,
48 out of 79 (61%) of the AR false positives are related to its identified AE. There are also
unknown drug combinations with no connection to its identified AE. For example, there is
no known interaction evidence between acetaminophen and isotretinoin and no information
on either of the drugs causing intestinal hemorrhage.

Author Manuscript

Overlapping findings.—There were only 4 drug combinations identified in common
between CARD (Support = 100, CAIM > 0) and AR (Support = 100, RR ≥ 2), which is an
unexpected but interesting finding. The four common drug combinations identified are
(Table S5): (docetaxel, carboplatin), (pemetrexed, dexamethasone), (alendronate, docetaxel),
and (dexamethasone, potassium). However, none of the pairs is indicated as interacting by
Epocrates. Moreover, only 1 rule in common was found: (pemetrexed, dexamethasone) →
pneumonia, but neither drug is known to be associated with pneumonia. The small number
of overlapping is because AR and CARD have different preferences of the rules and
different mining thresholds. In detail, CARD employs the CAIM to select the rule with
threshold CAIM>0, while AR uses the RR to select the rule with RR ≥ 2.

Author Manuscript

Confounded drug pairs.—As shown in Tables 3 and 4, 30% of CARD identified drug
combinations are due to confounding factors such as concomitant (frequently coadministered medications) or indication (symptom of underlying disease, not effect of
treatment) biases. As an illustration of taxonomy 2-a, alendronate was found to interact with
esomeprazole to cause femur fracture. Alendronate is a bisphosphonate drug used for
osteoporosis and other bone diseases. Esomeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor that reduces
stomach acid secretion, used to treat dyspepsia, peptic ulcer disease, and gastroesophageal
reflux disease. Some common adverse effects associated with alendronate include acid
regurgitation and dyspepsia, which can be treated with esomeprazole, but the combination is
not known to interact. This implies that our method may be finding BN structures as
depicted in Figure 2a or 2b rather than 2d, but conditional independence between the two
Artif Intell Med. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2019 March 28.

Cai et al.

Author Manuscript

medications can be wrongly estimated with missing y node (indications of alendronate).
Atypical femur fracture, identified as an AE for (alendronate + esomeprazole), is among the
list of serious adverse reactions for alendronate and fracture is also one serious reaction of
esomeprazole. Similarly for taxonomy 3-a, ramipril and simvastatin also seem to be a
combination found due to confounding variables and not known to interact. The identified
AE, rhabdomyolysis is simply a serious side-effect of simvastatin.
Furthermore for taxonomy 2-b, ranitidine is used to treat acid regurgitation and dyspepsia
associated with alendronate, but not known to interact. In addition, neither drug is related to
fall as indicated by CARD. Finally for taxonomy 3-b, aspirin and rosiglitazone also seems to
be found due to confounding issues; aspirin should be a drug for treating coronary artery
disease, not causing.

Discussion
Accurate identification of causal relationships between drug combinations and adverse
events require not only analysis of all drug-event combinations but also cause-and-effect
estimation of the relationships. Through the adoption of the essential properties of CBN Vstructures in association rule mining, our proposed CARD method can efficiently identify
causal associations between drug combinations and adverse events. A comparison to the
traditional association rule mining method, CARD is demonstrated to identify more known
drug interactions and yield a lower number of unknown drug combinations. Nonetheless, our
study has limitations:

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

1.

CARD is not designed to identify causal relationships that cannot be represented
with V-structures. Theoretically in an ideal world, DDIs should form V-structures
with its adverse effect. Thus, CARD is suitable for DDI discovery. In future
work, we will explore other CBN structures and bootstrapping to identify
persistently supported rules to increase confidence.

2.

Those identified rules unsupported by prior clinical knowledge could be spurious
or warrant further pharmacologic analysis regarding mechanism of action. From
an algorithm perspective, one not only needs to ensure precision on finding
known associations is sufficiently high but also the method is able to discover
new associations with high confidence. A potential approach to investigate the
unknown associations in the future is to conduct retrospective studies using
patient medical records.

3.

The overlapping finding between CARD and AR is low. One explanation is that
the two algorithms theoretically favor different rule sets. AR prefers highly
relevant rules measured by confidence and interestingness measures based on cooccurrence of item-sets and label. CARD conversely prefers item-sets with larger
difference but higher predictability when combined, using mutual information as
the penalty for discarding false rules generated from random combination of
frequent item-sets. Another possible explanation for the little overlap may be the
super large search space. For instance, our final dataset contained 7,701 drugs
and only considering combination of 2 drugs would yield 29,648,850 pairs;

Cai et al.

hence CARD and AR may be identifying combinations from different parts of
the actual DDI space.
This interesting observation made us more aware of the data granularity problem.
Although free text drug names were codified to generic names with a NLP tool,
it is not perfect; many written forms of drugs are not recognized and must be
used in analysis as a unique concept. Furthermore, AE granularity is a challenge
as well (11,569 MedDRA coded AEs). Our future work needs to explore
analyses with meta-categorization of drugs and AEs by leveraging their
hierarchical and ontological structures.
4.

Author Manuscript

Many of the CARD identified drug combinations are still due to confounding
factors such as concomitant usage or indication biases. By design, CARD may
identify more interrelated patterns than existing methods but can also
inadvertently find more undesired confounded patterns. Since confounding
variables correlate with both the dependent and independent variables, incorrect
estimate of the relationship between variables may occur when confounding
factors are unaccounted for. However, limited by the nature of the spontaneous
reporting data, this study only considered drug events; missing essential
phenotypic information such as indications and comorbidities. As our future
work, a promising approach is to explore larger set of clinical variables from
patient medical records standardized through our participation in PCORnet [51]
and FDA’s Sentinel initiative [52].

Author Manuscript

Association rule mining is a well-researched method for discovering interesting relationships
between variables in large databases. The relations discovered are typically in the form of
rules A → B, where A and B in this case denote a set of drugs and a set of adverse events,
respectively (e.g., (aspirin, warfarin) → bleeding). A major limitation of the traditional
association rule mining method is that the strength of rules is measured based on
correlations, which does not imply causality. To address the limitation in this study, we
introduce the concept of causality into association rule mining by proposing a Causal
Bayesian network based method called Causal Association Rule Discovery (CARD). The
CARD algorithm is described in detail as follows.

CARD – Causal Association Rule Discovery
Problem Definition
Let D = [d1,d2, ⋯, dn] denote the indicators of the drugs taken, where di is a binary indicator
of the action whether a patient has taken the ith drug or not. Let y be a binary indicator of the
occurrence of an adverse drug reaction (ADR) and s j = [d1j , d2j , ⋯, dnj, y j] represents an ADR
report j. Let Ij denote the event that ith drug is taken (di = 1) and A denote the event that an
ADR has occurred (y = 1), then an adverse reaction triggered by drug-drug interaction
(DDIs) can be formulated as an association rule, Ii1 Ii2 ⋯ Iik → A. As DDI involves more
than one drug, we only focus on the rules with k ≥ 2. Given a set of ADR reports, S = [s1,
s2,⋯, sm], we aim to discover drug combinations that cause adverse reactions through causal
association rule discovery.

Author Manuscript

In the following sections, we first formalize the concept of causal association rules, then
derive important properties of casual association rules, and finally propose an efficient
causal association rule discovery method.
Concept of Causal Association
Causal faithfulness condition is a commonly used assumption in causal discovery problems.
According to the causal faithfulness condition, there exists a causal Bayesian network N
faithful to the joint probability distribution P defined on [d1,d2, ⋯,dn, y]. For example,
Figure 1 illustrates a causal Bayesian network with the drug and reaction variables as nodes.
In the Bayesian network, each directed edge indicates the direct causal influence between
the parent node and child node. Thus, d2, d3 in Figure 3 denote the direct causes of ADR y.

Author Manuscript

Based on the direct causes, we can define the causal association rule as in Definition 1. The
causal association rules in the form of I2 I3 → A are the focus of this study, where the
corresponding variables I2 and I3, d2 and d3 are all the direct causes of the ADR event A
(i.e., y = 1).
Definition 1. Causal Association Rule: an association rule, Ii1 Ii2 ⋯ → A, defined on D ∪ y,
is a causal association rule if di1 di2 ⋯ dik are the direct causes of y.
Properties of Causal Association

Author Manuscript

Although a lot of work has been conducted on the concept of causality, such as Dr. Judea
Pearl’s inductive causality method [1], Dr. Peter Spirtes’ causal Bayesian network based
methods [2], additive noise model [3], and a hybrid approach [4], causal discovery on high
dimensional and sparse adverse drug-drug interaction data is still an open problem. Instead
of reconstructing a causal Bayesian network, we propose to use the properties of causal
Bayesian network to derive important properties of causal association rules, and apply such
properties to guild the search of causal association rules.
In the simplest case, a causal Bayesian network with three variables {d1, d2, y} can have
four primitive structures as shown in Figure 2. The structures in Figure 2a, 2b, and 2c are
independent-equivalent because they entail the same set of conditional independence

relationships. In other words, variable d1 is conditionally independent of variable d2 given
variable (i.e. d1 ⊥ d2|y). However, Figure 2d forms a V-structure and implies a different
assertion that there exists a variable set D′ ⊂ D − {d1, d2} and variable d1 is conditionally
independent of variable d2 given D’ (i.e. d1 ⊥ d2|D′ holds), but dependent given D’ ∪ {y}
(i.e. d1 ⊥ d2| D′ ∪ {y} does not hold).
As defined by Pearl [1],”two causal models are equivalent if and only if their direct acyclic
graphs have the same links and the same set of uncoupled head-to-head nodes”, in which the
uncoupled head-to-head nodes indicate a V-structure. This suggests that causal associations
can be inferred from V-structures.
Approach to Causal Association Rule Discovery

Author Manuscript

Accordingly, we propose a causality interesting measure for the rule Ii1 Ii2 ⋯ Iik → A based
on the properties of V-structure. Consider the simplest case, Ii1 Ii2 ⋯ → A, if both Ii1 and Ii2
are causes of A, then the corresponding three variables di1, di2 and y of Ii1, Ii2 and A forms a
V-structure, di1 → y ← di2. Thus, the following conditions must hold:
1.

There does not exist D′ ⊂ D − {di1, di2} satisfying di1 ⊥ y | D′ or di2 ⊥ y | D′

2.

There exists D′ ⊂ D − {di1, di2} satisfying di1 ⊥ di2 | D′ and di1 ⊥ di2|{ D′, A }.
where D′ can be an empty set.

To measure the strength of association and independence relation, we use the normalized
mutual information [5]. The above properties can be transferred to the following three
heuristic rules of the causal association interestingness measure:

Author Manuscript

•

di1 and di2 should be highly associated with A, thus the rule with higher N( di1,
y) + N( di2, y) is preferred. Here N(di1, y) is the normalized mutual information;

•

di1 and di2 should be independent of each other given some variable set D′, thus
the
rule with lower N(di1,di1 | y) is preferred;

•

di2 and di2 should be dependent of each other given some variable set { D′, y},
thus the rule with higher N( di1, di1| y) is preferred

Combining the above three heuristic rules, we obtain the following causal association
interestingness measure (CAIM):
CAIM I i1I i2

A = N(d i1, y) + N(d i2, y) − N(d i1, d i2) + N(d i1, d i2 y)

(1)

Author Manuscript

For the rule I → A with more than three antecedents, any sub-rules containing two
antecedents must also form a V-structure with the adverse drug reaction, di1 → y ← di2.
Because the interestingness of rule I → A is dependent on the weakness of its sub-rules, the
generalized interestingness measure is defined as follows.

CAIM(I

A) =

I i1, I i2 ⊂ I

(2)

The interestingness defined in Formula (2) has a good monotonic property with the
increasing number of antecedents (Theorem 1), which can be used in the mining procedure
to accelerate interesting rule mining process. The proof of the theorem is straightforward
and skipped here.
Theorem 1. Monotonic property: given any two association rules I1 → A and I2 → A, if
I1 ⊂ I2, then CAIM( I1 → A) ≥ CAIM( I2 → A) holds.

Author Manuscript

Based on the definition of CAIM( I → A) given in Formula (2), we can derive the following
incremental updating strategy for CAIM. The incremental updating strategy provides an
efficient way to estimate the interestingness when combined with incremental association
rule mining approach.
Theorem 2. Incremental updating strategy for CAIM: given two association rules I → A
and an item I ∉ I,CAIM(I ∪ {I} A) = min{CAIM(I A), min CAIM(II′ A)}.
I′ ∈ I

In addition to the interestingness measure, we can also derive the following pruning strategy
of rules based on the properties of V-structures.

Author Manuscript

Theorem 3. Pruning strategy: given a causal association rule I → A, there do not exist
two variables Ii1, Ii2 ∈ I satisfying di1 ⊥ di2| y, where di1, di2 and y are the corresponding
variables of Ii1, Ii2 and A respectively.
Proof: Because I → A is a causal association rule and Ii1, Ii2 ∈,I corresponding variables on
di1, di2 and y form a V-structure di1 → y ← di2. Based on the properties of V-structure, we
know that di1 ⊥ di2|y does not hold.
Based on the CAIM, the proposed CARD algorithm is as follows.

The algorithm shown above is adopted from the incremental rule mining algorithm proposed
in [6]. It takes three input variables including the ADR sample set S and two user specified
parameters, minimal support threshold t and minimal CAIM threshold c, and returns a set of
potential causal association rules by conducting a mixture of breadth-first and depth-first
search in the association rule lattice space. More specifically, the items are sequentially
added to the lattice maintained as rule set R in a breadth-first manner. To process item I,
existing lattice is partitioned and processed in the depth manner, i.e. the item is added to the
rules with 1 item, then the rules with 2 items, and so on and so forth. For each newly
generated rule, the support and CAIM are calculated, only the ones that passed the support
threshold, CAIM threshold, and the pruning process can be added to the rule set R. More
details about the incremental mining method can be found in [5].
