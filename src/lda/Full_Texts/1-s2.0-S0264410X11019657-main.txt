During the 2010–2011 inﬂuenza season, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Food and
Drug Administration conducted enhanced vaccine safety monitoring for possible febrile seizures in all
trivalent inﬂuenza vaccine (TIV) products in the United States using the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting
System (VAERS). We used Empirical Bayesian data mining techniques to assess disproportionate reporting after TIV and reviewed febrile seizure reports in children aged <5 years. On November 23, 2010, the
combination of the coding term “febrile convulsion” and the Fluzone® TIV product exceeded a predetermined threshold in the VAERS database. By December 10, we conﬁrmed 43 reports of febrile seizure
following TIV in children aged 6–23 months. Clinical features of most reports were consistent with typical uncomplicated febrile seizures, and all children recovered. Further epidemiologic assessment of a
possible association between TIV and febrile seizures was undertaken in a separate, population-based
vaccine safety monitoring system.

1. Introduction
The Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), comanaged by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), is the US spontaneous
reporting system for adverse events (AEs) after vaccination, and
VAERS surveillance for inﬂuenza vaccines is implemented annually
[1–3]. In 2010, Australia reported a new ﬁnding of increased risk of
febrile seizures in young children following receipt of 2010 Southern Hemisphere trivalent inactivated inﬂuenza vaccine (TIV) from
one manufacturer, CSL Biotherapies [4–6]. Because of this ﬁnding,
CDC and FDA instituted enhanced surveillance in VAERS for febrile
seizures after US TIV in children aged <5 years.
2. Methods
VAERS accepts reports from healthcare providers, manufacturers, vaccine recipients, and others. Healthcare providers are
required to report AEs listed in the VAERS Table of Reportable
Events following Vaccination, which does not include febrile
seizures after TIV, and are encouraged to report other clinically

signiﬁcant AEs after vaccination [7]. Reported AEs are entered
into a database and coded using Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) terms [8]. From July 1, 2010 through
December 10, 2010, we used complementary strategies to monitor
febrile seizures after US 2010–2011 TIV products: disproportionate
reporting analysis and clinical review of individual reports. Foreign
reports were excluded. Because VAERS is a routine surveillance
program that does not meet the deﬁnition of research, it is not
subject to institutional review board review and informed consent
requirements.
On a bimonthly basis, beginning in October 2010, Empirical Bayesian data mining [9] was conducted to identify AEs
reported more frequently than expected following TIV, using published criteria [10]. We evaluated all 2010–2011 inﬂuenza vaccine
product-speciﬁc AE pairs with reporting proportions at least twice
that of other vaccines in the VAERS database (i.e., lower bound of the
90% conﬁdence interval of the Empirical Bayesian Geometric Mean
[EB05] > 2). The primary analysis required a minimum count of one
vaccine-AE combination, and was adjusted for sex, year of initial
report receipt, and age group. A secondary age stratiﬁed analysis
was also conducted using standard pre-speciﬁed age groups used
at FDA; this analysis was adjusted for sex and year received only.
To limit comparisons to other vaccines that might be more similar,
we also conducted these analyses using a restricted VAERS database
which only included reports following inactivated vaccines (i.e., if a
live vaccine was administered with or without inactivated vaccine,
these reports were excluded).

The 11 pre-deﬁned data mining age groups identiﬁed by Empirica include
(0–<18 months, 18–<54 months, 54 months to <12.5 years, 12.5 years to <16.5 years,
16.5 years to <29.5 years, 29.5 years to <45.5 years, 45.5 years to <64.5 years,
64.5 years to <75.5 years, 75.5 years to <85.5 years, 85.5 years and above, and age
unknown). FDA Center for Drug Evaluation and Research epidemiology staff selected
these age groups during development of the Empirical Bayesian application which is
used for all pharmaceuticals regulated by FDA. The age groups were intended to facilitate examination of product-event combinations in populations such as children,
females of childbearing age, and the elderly.

In parallel with VAERS data mining activities, each possible
febrile seizure event was identiﬁed and reviewed on a daily basis.
We conducted automated searches of VAERS reports in children
aged <5 years who received 2010–2011 TIV using the MedDRA
terms convulsion, grand mal convulsion, status epilepticus, convulsions local and febrile convulsion. In addition, VAERS staff manually
reviewed all incoming reports in children aged <5 years after
2010–2011 TIV for potential signs and symptoms of seizures. While
VAERS routinely requests medical records for non-manufacturer
reports coded as serious1 , during the 2010–2011 inﬂuenza season VAERS staff requested medical records for all possible seizures
reported to VAERS after TIV in children <5 years. CDC and FDA
physicians reviewed each of these VAERS reports and associated
records. A febrile seizure was considered veriﬁed if a medical
provider diagnosed either “febrile seizure” or “seizure” with documented fever ≥100.4◦ . Level of diagnostic certainty for seizures was
classiﬁed according to the Brighton Collaboration case deﬁnition
[11,12].
3. Results
In the data mining analysis, disproportionately higher reporting
for “febrile convulsion” combined with 2010–2011 Fluzone® was
observed for reports received by November 23, 2011, compared
with other vaccines in the VAERS database (Table 1). Thirty-ﬁve
reports with the “febrile convulsion” term were veriﬁed after
review by a VAERS team physician. In the subsequent data mining analysis for reports received by December 10, 2010, the signal
persisted. Forty-one reports with the febrile convulsion code were
identiﬁed (including the 35 earlier reports); one report did not
describe an incident case and was ruled out (Table 1). Of the 40
remaining reports, 33 (83%) were in children aged <2 years. In the
age-stratiﬁed data mining analysis, the EB05 did not exceed 2.0
in any of the age strata other than 0–<18 months. Similar ﬁndings were observed after 2010–2011 Fluzone® when data mining
analysis was restricted to only include inactivated vaccines. Taken

6–23 months and all reports in 2–4 years were Fluzone® .

together, we assessed the clinically relevant age for the signal to
be in children 6–23 months. Additionally, disproportionate reporting for febrile seizures was not detected following 2010–2011 TIV
products other than Fluzone® .
For the clinical review component, we identiﬁed 456 total
reports after 2010–2011 TIV in children aged <5 years. Of these, 70
were assessed as possible seizures and reviewed; medical records
were available for all reports. In addition to the 40 reports coded
with “febrile convulsion” identiﬁed in the data mining analysis,
clinical review veriﬁed 11 additional reports of febrile seizure after
2010–2011 Fluzone® using the broader search strategy (Fig. 1). Of
the 51 conﬁrmed reports, 43 (84%) were in the 6–23 months age
group. Most (86%) of the 43 children had onset of febrile seizures
on the same day or one day after receipt of Fluzone® . Of 25 subjects
with adequate information who had febrile seizure onset within
24 h of Fluzone® , 15 (60%) had onset less than 12 h and 10 (40%)
had onset 12–23 h after vaccination.
Among the children aged 6–23 months, 16 (37%) received no
other vaccine at the time Fluzone® was administered, while
those who received at least one other vaccine concomitantly with
Fluzone® received the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine
most often (n = 14) (Table 2). Of 42 children aged 6–23 months with
sufﬁcient information, 36 received dose 1 of 2010–2011 Fluzone®
before the febrile seizure. Thirty children received medical attention in the emergency department and were discharged home and
eight children were hospitalized overnight. Two other children
required intensive care unit management for status epilepticus;
each had received MMR and other vaccines with Fluzone® and
had seizure onset 7–10 days after vaccination. All children recovered. Twenty-one (49%) of 43 reports conﬁrmed as febrile seizure
in children 6–23 months by CDC–FDA physician review also met
the Brighton case deﬁnition for generalized convulsive seizure after
Fluzone® , which includes Brighton levels 1–3 (Table 2). Twentytwo (51%) of the reports were classiﬁed as Brighton level 4.
4. Comment
Rapidly detecting and assessing vaccine safety signals is an
important component of US immunization safety monitoring activities [13]. The ability of VAERS staff to perform Empirical Bayesian
disproportionate reporting analysis (data mining), while conducting clinical reviews of reports proved useful for a preliminary
assessment of the signal for febrile seizures after TIV in young

children. In recent years, statistical data mining methods have been
used to allow rapid identiﬁcation of possible signals in large spontaneous reporting systems for AEs [14]. Cases of febrile seizures
reported to VAERS were identiﬁed through FDA data mining that
were coded with the MedDRA term “febrile convulsion” combined
with Fluzone® . Once the statistical threshold for a vaccine-AE pair
is crossed, clinical judgment is required to determine if a safety signal is present. This use of complementary techniques makes VAERS
well-suited for immediate response when issues in vaccine safety
arise.
Our proactive approach resulted in obtaining all medical documentation, including most vaccination records, for reported cases
likely to represent febrile seizures after any inﬂuenza vaccine.
Clinical review veriﬁed that most of the possible seizure reports
submitted were febrile seizures. We conﬁrmed that most reports
following 2010–2011 TIV in the US were in children aged <2 years,
had onset within 0–1 days, and had features that were typical of
uncomplicated febrile seizures, which have a good prognosis [15].
Our analyses are subject to several limitations. As a passive
surveillance system, VAERS is subject to reporting biases. Moreover, VAERS is not designed to determine if increased risk for an AE
after vaccination exists, quantify the level of risk, or assess causality. Based on the recommended immunization schedule, receipt
of VAERS reports in young children who received multiple vaccinations is expected [16]. About two-thirds of the children with
conﬁrmed febrile seizures had simultaneous vaccination with up
to seven vaccines in up to twenty combinations making it difﬁcult
to assess the roles, if any, of other recommended vaccines known
to be associated with increased febrile seizure risk [17]. Furthermore, some children had evidence of other infections that might
have contributed to the febrile seizures. Our enhanced monitoring

with differential follow up and coding for febrile convulsions after
2010–2011 TIV may have introduced potential bias as compared
to previous years. The application of the Brighton Collaboration
case deﬁnition for generalized convulsive seizure in VAERS has previously been described [18] and in this case proved challenging,
limited by variability of details in medical records. This resulted
in over half of the clinically veriﬁed febrile seizure reports meeting Level 4 classiﬁcation in which a seizure has been reported but
there is insufﬁcient information documented to meet the Brighton
case deﬁnition. Lastly, since Fluzone® was the only inﬂuenza vaccine recommended for children aged 6–23 months during the US
2010–2011 season, it is unlikely that a signal in this age group with
a known risk of febrile seizures would have been detected with any
other formulation [5].
Despite the limitations of VAERS and the preliminary nature of
the ﬁndings, we believed the signal of possible increased risk of
febrile seizures following 2010–2011 Fluzone® was important to
communicate to the public and the ﬁnding was posted on the FDA
website in January 2011 [19]. Further assessment of the signal was
undertaken and described by the Vaccine Safety Datalink, which is
designed to conduct population-based evaluations of AEs following
immunization [20].
