Abstract
Background and Aim: Recent evidence has concerned acute kidney injury (AKI) after the
proton pump inhibitor (PPI) application. There are few real-world studies to compare the
occurrences, clinical features, and prognosis of AKI related to various PPI regimens. We
aimed to evaluate and compare the links between different PPIs and AKI in a large
population by investigating the Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting
System (FAERS) until recently.
Methods: Disproportionality analysis and Bayesian analysis were used in data mining to
screen the suspected AKI after different PPIs based on the FAERS from January 2004 to
December 2019. The times to onset, fatality, and hospitalization rates of PPI-associated
AKI were also investigated.
Results: We identiﬁed 19 522 PPI-associated AKIs, which appeared to inﬂuence more
middle-aged patients than elderly ones (53.04% vs 33.94%). Women were more affected
than men (55.42% vs 44.58%). Lansoprazole appeared a stronger AKI association than
other PPIs, based on the highest reporting odds ratio (reporting odds ratio = 20.8, 95%
conﬁdence interval = 20.16, 21.46), proportional reporting ratio (proportional reporting
ratio = 15.55, χ 2 = 73 899.68), and empirical Bayes geometric mean (empirical Bayes
geometric mean = 15.15, 95% conﬁdence interval = 14.76). The median time to AKI onset
was 446 (interquartile range [IQR] 16–2176) days after PPI administration. PPIs showed a
signiﬁcant difference in average time to AKI onset (P < 0.001), with the shortest of 9
(IQR 3–25) days for rabeprazole and the longest of 1221 (IQR 96.5–2620) days for
esomeprazole. PPI-associated AKI generally led to a 5.69% fatality rate and an 8.94%
hospitalization rate. The highest death rate occurred in rabeprazole (15.35%).
Conclusions: Based on the FAERS database, we proﬁled AKI related to various PPIs with
more details in occurrences, clinical characteristics, and prognosis. Concern should be paid
for PPIs when applied to patients with a tendency for AKI.

Introduction
Since their debut in 1989,1 proton pump inhibitor (PPI) has been
widely used in both prescription2,3 and over the counter.4 The
marketed PPIs until recently include omeprazole, esomeprazole,
lansoprazole, dexlansoprazole, rabeprazole, and pantoprazole
(Table 1). Indications for PPI include acid-related diseases such
as peptic ulcer disease and gastroesophageal reﬂux disease, as well
as prevention of the adverse effects accompanied with glucocorticoid or nonsteroidal anti-inﬂammatory drugs.1,5 To be of concern,
over 50% of PPIs in clinical practice have been prescribed without
justiﬁable indication or considered unnecessary.3,6
Despite their generally favorable safety proﬁles in post-marketing
trials,7–10 some uncommon but potentially severe adverse effects of

156

PPIs have been reported, among which the kidney diseases are
notable.11 The reports of the adverse renal outcome associated with
PPIs could be dated from the 1990s.12,13 Recently, accumulating
evidence has aroused the strong association of acute kidney injury
(AKI) following PPI regimens,14–19 with a shallow incidence
rate of around 12 per 100 000 person-years.19 Acute interstitial
nephritis (AIN) is the manifest form evidenced in PPI-associated
AKI.19–21 The long-term PPI usage may result in chronic kidney
disease (CKD) through AIN, recurrent AKI, or inconspicuous
clinical course16,17,22–24 and lead to an increased mortality rate.25,26
Although there are increasing studies concerning the PPI-associated
AKI, most evidence sourced from cases12,13,27 and clinical cohorts
or case–control studies,14–17,19,28 through which is still far from
necessary to understand a relatively uncommon adverse event.

Adverse Event Reporting System database.

There is no pharmacovigilance study until recently illustrating
PPI-mediated AKI, and the knowledge is scarce about the renal
safety proﬁle following various PPIs in real-world clinical practice.
Therefore, we aimed to evaluate and compare the links between
different PPIs and AKI in a large population by investigating the
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Adverse Event Reporting
System (FAERS) until recently. We further examined the time to
onset and fatality and hospitalization rates for AKI of different
PPI regimens.

Methods
Data source. In this study, we conducted a retrospective
pharmacovigilance study using the FAERS database from January
2004 to December 2019.
The FAERS database is a public, voluntary, spontaneous reporting
system (SRS) that contains information about adverse drug events
and medication error reports submitted by health professionals,
patients, and manufacturers not only from the USA but also from
other regions.
The FAERS data ﬁles comprise eight types of datasets as follows:
patient demographic and administrative information (DEMO),
drug information (DRUG), adverse events (REAC), patient outcomes (OUTC), report sources (RPSR), therapy start dates and
end dates for reported drugs (THER), and indications for drug
administration (INDI).
A total of 13 649 428 reports were obtained from the FAERS
database and removed duplicated records according to the FDA’s
recommendations, selecting the latest FDA_DT when the
CASEIDs were the same and choosing the higher PRIMARYID
when the CASEID and FDA_DT were the same, resulting in a
reduction in the number of 11 457 044 (Fig. 1).

Adverse event and drug identiﬁcation. Acute kidney
injury was taken from the REAC ﬁles based on Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA, version 22.1) at the
Preferred Term level. We considered the following Preferred
Terms as related to AKI, especially in the scenario when PPIs were
administered: “acute kidney injury [10069339],” “subacute kidney
injury [10081980],” “blood creatinine increased [10005483],”
“blood urea abnormal [10005846],” “glomerular ﬁltration rate
decreased [10018358],” “renal impairment [10062237],” “oliguria
[10030302],” “anuria [10002847],” “dialysis [10061105],”
“proteinuria [10037032],” “renal tubular injury [10078933],”
“nephropathy toxic [10029155],” “nephritis allergic [10029120],”
and “tubulointerstitial nephritis [10048302].”
We selected the PPIs’ generic and brand name by using IBM
Micromedex as the dictionary during the data mining process
(Table 1).

Data mining. Based on the basic principles of Bayesian
analysis and non-proportional analysis, we adopted the reporting
odds ratio (ROR), the proportional reporting ratio (PRR),
the Bayesian conﬁdence propagation neural network, and the
multi-item gamma Poisson shrinker algorithms to investigate the
association between the drug and the given adverse events. Table 2
lists the equations and criteria for each of the four algorithms. We
compared the correlations between AKI and different PPIs. The
speciﬁc PPI was identiﬁed as “primary suspect” in the
ROLE_COD ﬁeld of DRUG ﬁles.
We also estimated the time to onset of AKI for different PPIs,
which was deﬁned as the interval between the EVENT_DT
(adverse event onset date) and the START_DT (start date of the
PPIs administration). We excluded the records with incorrect entry
or erred input (EVETN_DT earlier than START_DT).

Also, we analyzed reports with fatal events due to adverse drug

events by the total number of PPIs induced AKI events.
Statistical analysis. We used descriptive analysis to summarize the clinical characteristics of AKI patients resulted in PPIs
from the FAERS database. The onset times of PPI-associated AKI
among different PPIs were compared using non-parametric tests
(the Mann–Whitney U-test for dichotomous variables and the
Kruskal–Wallis test when there were more than two subgroups
of respondents). Pearson’s chi-squared test or Fisher’s exact test
was used to compare the mortality and hospitalization rates
between different PPIs. The statistical signiﬁcance was set at
P < 0.05 with 95% conﬁdence intervals. All data mining and
statistical analyses were conducted using SAS, version 9.4
(SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA).

Results
Descriptive analysis. A total of 141 201 adverse events related to PPIs and 19 522 reports related to AKI were
documented in the FAERS database dated from January 2004 to
December 2019. We have screened 19 522 reports with suspected
PPI-related kidney impairments and summarized the clinical features of these patients in Table 3. More than 90% of cases were
reported from North America (92.65%), followed by 5.90% of
cases reported from Europe; 46.30% of reports were submitted
by non-healthcare professionals, compared with 13.89% submitted
by healthcare professionals, and left 39.81% cases with
non-speciﬁed reporters. The reported cases of PPI-related AKI

have gradually increased from 2004 to 2019, with a peak of 13 176
(67.49%) cases in 2019. Excluding the unspeciﬁed age, patients
younger than 65 years old were more affected than elderly patients
(66.06% vs 33.94%), and middle-aged (45–64 years old) patients
accounted for 53.04% reported cases. Excluding the unspeciﬁed
data, women were reported more frequently than men (55.42%
vs 44.58%). The most commonly reported PPI-associated AKIs
were related to esomeprazole (n = 7483, 38.33%), followed by
lansoprazole (n = 5484, 28.09%). PPIs were prescribed mostly in
patients with gastroesophageal reﬂux disease (6615, 49.64%),
compared with patients diagnosed with functional dyspepsia
ranking the second (570, 4.28%).
Disproportionality analysis and Bayesian analysis. We detected kidney impairments signals for all six PPI
regimens based on the criteria for the four algorithms and listed
the results in Table 4. Among all PPIs, lansoprazole was noteworthy for the relationship to AKI due to its highest ROR, PRR, and
EBGM; dexlansoprazole ranked the second, whereas omeprazole
appeared a relatively weaker association with AKI than others,
based on its lowest RORs, PRRs, and EBGMs.
Time to onset of proton pump inhibitor-associated
acute kidney injury. Overall, the median time to event onset
of PPI-associated AKI was 446 (interquartile range [IQR]
16–2176) days. We described the time to onsets of renal events
for each PPI in Figure 2. Noteworthily, we found that AKI could
potentially occur as soon as the ﬁrst dose of all PPI regimens.
The quick onsets of AKI took place in 6.16% of all
PPI-associated AKI cases and respectively have occurred in
8.54%, 3.74%, 5.00%, 3.70%, 8.70%, and 8.94% of patients

administered with omeprazole, esomeprazole, lansoprazole,
dexlansoprazole, rabeprazole, and pantoprazole. There was a signiﬁcant difference in average time to onset of renal events among
different PPI therapies (Kruskal–Wallis test, P < 0.001), with the
shortest median time of 9 (IQR 3–25) days for rabeprazole and the
longest of 1221 (IQR 96.5–2620) days for esomeprazole.

Fatality and hospitalization due to proton pump
inhibitor-associated kidney impairments. To analyze
the prognosis of PPI-associated AKI, we assessed the rate of fatality and hospitalization due to adverse renal events following
various PPI treatments and generated the results in Figure 3.
PPI-associated AKI generally led to outcomes with a 5.69% fatality rate and an 8.94% hospitalization rate. Among all PPIs, there
was a signiﬁcant difference in fatality rates across different PPI
regimens (Pearson’s chi-squared test for overall comparison,
P < 0.001). The highest mortality rate occurred in rabeprazole
(15.35%), and the lowest one resulted in omeprazole (4.07%).
We also found a signiﬁcant difference in hospitalization rate
among various PPIs (Pearson’s chi-squared test for overall
comparison, P < 0.001). The hospitalization rate of
omeprazole-associated AKI patients ranked the highest

Discussion
To the best of our knowledge, this study is the ﬁrst and largest
collection until recently to compare the associations, timing, and
prognosis of AKI after the use of different PPIs in the real-world
practice based on the FAERS pharmacovigilance database. All
the six PPIs in this study demonstrated association with AKI,
and the diverse characteristics across regimens could be found.
Omeprazole was the ﬁrst FDA-approved PPI, and it was recognized in the 1990s as a suspicious medicine associated with AKI,
mainly in the form of AIN.12,13 During a 10-year period since
1993, biopsy-proven AINs from various PPIs have been deducted
in two Australian hospitals as a potential cause of AKI in patients
without an apparent cause of kidney dysfunction.21 Recent clinical
cohorts,15–17,28 case–control studies,14,19 and meta-analysis18,29
have revealed the increased AKI incidence in PPI receivers.
Although PPI-associated AKI has attracted clinical attention,14–
19,28
the assessment and characterization of which through persuasive randomized control trials (RCTs) are challenging because of
its very low incidence19 and occasionally inconspicuous clinical
course. Current clinical studies still lack enough power to draw deﬁnitive conclusions about drug safety due to the limited sample
sizes and relatively short observation periods. Importantly, SRS
could serve as a primary source of post-marketing data leading
to PPI safety issues, including renal outcomes. In our study based
on the FAERS, we noticed the generally incremental reports year
by year, which skyrocketed in 2019 as contributing more than
65% cases. A little to our surprise, non-healthcare professionals
have submitted more reports than healthcare professionals in our
data. These phenomena indicate that PPI-associated AKI has been
aware through a series of clinical studies,14–19 even among the
consumers. In our study, PPI-associated AKI appeared to inﬂuence
more middle-aged patients than elderly ones (53.04% vs 33.94%).
This ﬁnding is consistent with one meta-analysis, which revealed
that PPIs had no signiﬁcant association with AKI in elderly

160

patients.18 Our data also indicated that PPI-associated AKI
affected more women than men (55.42% vs 44.58%). The mechanism may explain the disparity in age and sex of the affected patients that drug-induced AKI is related to an immune
hypersensitivity reaction,30–32 which is known to be more
common in the relatively younger age and women. Differently, a
previous nested case–control study indicated that elderly patients
were more vulnerable to PPI-associated AKI.19 There are some
explanations for the controversy. First, the FAERS database can
be voluntarily reported by medicine consumers, and the relatively
younger generation could be more skillful in generating more
reports. Second, there were a certain amount of missing or unknown ages in our collection, and it would be premature to draw
a solid conclusion. Third, the declined kidney function in elderly
patients33 is also vulnerable to many confounding exposures,
which may disguise the contribution to PPI nephrotoxicity. Therefore, we should be conscious of concluding the tendency in the age
of PPI-associated AKI.
Limited data have compared the association of AKI among
different PPI regimens. In the pharmacovigilance investigation,
we found that all PPIs are relevant to AKI, among which
lansoprazole appeared to have a stronger association compared
with other PPIs. In contrast, omeprazole showed a relatively
weaker association. The cases about lansoprazole-induced AKI
have been noticed in clinical practice and cohorts.15,34 In a
population-based cohort, the hazard ratio of AKI was estimated
higher in lansoprazole than in pantoprazole or rabeprazole, but
lower than that in omeprazole.15 It would be difﬁcult to explain
the discrepancies between different studies. Some insights into
the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characteristics of PPIs
hint lansoprazole among PPIs exhibit lowest urinary excretion,
relatively longer half-life, and most potent CYP2C19 inhibiting
ability in vitro.1,35 Whether these characteristics of lansoprazole
relate to the possibly higher association with AKI needs further
conﬁrmation. However, there still lacks head-to-head comparison
on renal effects among different PPIs in clinical studies.
Another chief ﬁnding was that the median time to onset of renal
effects is 446 (IQR 16–2176) days among PPI regimens. It is

G Chen et al.

similar to other research, which indicates that the risk of renal outcomes is most likely to be observed during cumulative exposure of
361–720 days after PPIs.17 Consciousness is also suggested for
the phenomena of potentially quick onsets of AKI after the
ﬁrst-time administration of all six PPIs, which may occur in
around 6% of patients of PPI-associated AKI. Therefore, monitoring of kidney function would be necessary, at least in some more
vulnerable patients, once start PPIs. Judging from the average time
to onset, it appears that rabeprazole leads to AKI in the shortest
median onset time of within 1 month among all PPI compounds.
In contrast, AKI may strike esomeprazole receivers even after
several years. The varied predominance in the average onset times
among PPI regimens suggests that individualized monitoring
strategies can be performed after PPI administration. For example,
we should be watchful on kidney function shortly after applicating
rabeprazole, while the necessity of long-term PPI usage should be
regularly evaluated to avoid possible harm.
To further compare the severity of AKI associated with various
PPIs, we investigated the fatality and hospitalization rates. It was
observed that the outcomes of AKI were not reasonably satisfactory, generally resulting in 8.94% hospitalization and 5.69% death.
The death associated with omeprazole-induced AKI remained the
lowest of 4.07%, but the admission happened in the same set
ranked the highest at 22.50%. These data may indicate the more
intensive care in omeprazole receivers after the incidence of
AKI. The death rate in rabeprazole-associated AKI is concerning,
striking as high as 15.35%. Admittedly, the number of rabeprazole
representatives is not as robust as that of other PPIs in our study.
However, combined with its possibly early onset of AKI after
rabeprazole administration, it is not overwhelming to alert the
intensiﬁed monitoring of kidney function, and the immediate
withdrawal of rabeprazole once AKI occurs. The key to the
treatment of PPI-associated AKI is the early cessation of the offering agent, and sometimes steroids may play a role in hastening
renal recovery.5,31
Nowadays, the application of PPIs is already penetrating in
daily clinical practice with a large amount of unnecessary usage.3,6
We also found in this study that almost 40% of the PPIs were administered with unknown or missing indications. Although
PPI-associated AKI is uncommon, the large population of PPI
receivers demonstrates considerable AKI cases year by year. Clinicians should be alerted for PPI-associated AKI across various PPI
regimens. The present ﬁndings can be applied in clinical decisions
over the choice of PPI treatments, discontinuing unnecessary application, and identiﬁcation of high-risk patients, in light of patient
ages, basal renal function, and tendencies of different PPIs on
mediating AKI.
Despite the advantages of real-world research and the data mining techniques in this study, we admit that some particular analysis
of adverse drug reaction signals is not feasible based on the SRS.
Therefore, there are some limitations to this study. First, during the
process of data mining, we noticed the imperfection of information, such as incorrect inputs and incomplete reports, which may
lead to bias in the analysis. Second, the data available in SRS only
cover patients with adverse effects. Some relevant statistics, such
as the incidence rate for each suspicious drug, cannot be calculated
because of the lack of total numbers of patients receiving treatment. Third, it is difﬁcult to proﬁle speciﬁc important risk factors
between PPIs and AKI, because of the deﬁciency of baseline renal

function, preexisting renal diseases, and comorbidities that may
have impacts on renal adverse effects. Fourth, media attention
and the recent publication of an adverse event in the literature
might affect reporting behaviors.36 Although there is some
inherited limitation in the FAERS database, it signals some critical
aspects of PPI-associated AKI, providing clues for further
well-designed researches.

Conclusion
In the present study, we identiﬁed signals for AKI following
various PPIs in real-world practice based on the FAERS database.
One ﬁnding surfaced from this study is that all PPIs were associated with AKI, while lansoprazole indicated a potential stronger
association. Moreover, a signiﬁcant difference in time of AKI onset after different PPIs is notable, and awareness should be raised
for some immediate occurrence following the initial administration
of PPI regimens. Besides, middle-aged women may be more
sensitive to PPI-associated AKI. Our ﬁndings pave the way for
continued pharmacovigilance investigation, and further studies
are encouraged to test the hypotheses generated in this study.
