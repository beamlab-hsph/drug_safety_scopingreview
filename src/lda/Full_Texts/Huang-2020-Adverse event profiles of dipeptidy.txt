Adverse event profiles of dipeptidyl
peptidase-4 inhibitors: data mining of the
public version of the FDA adverse event
reporting system
Jing Huang1, Yuntao Jia2, Shusen Sun3,4,5 and Long Meng6*

Abstract
Background: To describe and analyze the patterns of adverse events associated with dipeptidyl peptidase-4
inhibitors (DPP-4is) (sitagliptin, saxagliptin, linagliptin, vildagliptin, and alogliptin) from the FDA Adverse Event
Reporting System (FAERS) and to highlight areas of safety concerns.
Methods: Adverse events spontaneously submitted to the FAERS between 2004 Q1 to 2019 Q2 were included. The
online tool OpenVigil 2.1 was used to query the database. The research relied on definitions of preferred terms (PTs)
specified by the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) and the standardized MedDRA Queries (SMQ).
The reporting odds ratio (ROR), with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) was calculated for disproportionality analysis.
Results: Over 16 years, a total of 9706 adverse event reports were identified. Alogliptin was excluded from further
analysis due to insufficient sample size. Compared with the non-insulin antidiabetic drugs, the four DPP-4is were all
disproportionately associated with four SMQs: “gastrointestinal nonspecific inflammation and dysfunctional conditions,”
“hypersensitivity,” “severe cutaneous adverse reactions,” and “noninfectious diarrhoea”. As for PT level analyses, DPP-4is
are associated with higher reporting of the gastrointestinal tract, pancreas, malignancies, infection, musculoskeletal
disorders, general disorders, hypersensitivity, and skin AEs.
Conclusions: Data mining of the FAERS is useful for examining DPP-4 inhibitors-associated adverse events. The
findings of the present study are compatible with clinical experience, and it provides valuable information to decisionmakers and healthcare providers in clinical practice.

Background
Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is the most common
form of diabetes. Oral agents are the mainstay of pharmacological treatment for T2DM. Dipeptidyl peptidase-4
inhibitors (DPP-4is) are a valuable addition to the antidiabetic treatment modalities and have been widely used [1].

DPP-4is, sitagliptin, saxagliptin, linagliptin, vildagliptin,
and alogliptin, have significantly different chemical structures, leading to differences in their pharmacokinetic and
pharmacodynamic properties. It is not entirely clear if
these differences may result in differing safety profiles [2].
The drugs’ safety profiles in clinical practice may differ
from clinical trials that have been well-designed [3].
Therefore, it is necessary to explore adverse events (AEs)
induced by DPP-4is in a real-world environment.

Spontaneous reporting systems (SRS) of AEs generate
large pharmacovigilance databases, which can be used
for safety assessments on drug utilization in clinical
practice [4]. The FDA Adverse Event Reporting System
(FAERS), an open information database, was established
to serve the FDA’s post-marketing monitoring programs
for drugs and therapeutic products. The AE reports are
evaluated through quantitative signal detection algorithms, where a signal is an indicator of possible real
safety issues [5]. Signal detection is one of the essential
tools of pharmacovigilance [6].
Previous pharmacovigilance studies have revealed the
association between DPP-4is and some particular adverse events [7–9]. To achieve the latest information
about the safety profiles of DPP-4is, we queried an international SRS, namely FAERS, to characterize the reporting pattern of DPP-4is and map the entire spectrum of
AEs by the pharmacovigilance approach.

Methods
Data sources

Five DPP-4is, sitagliptin, saxagliptin, linagliptin, vildagliptin, and alogliptin, were selected as study drugs. Data
from the SRS database were fully anonymized by regulatory authorities.
Data for this study were retrieved from the public release of the FAERS database, which covered the period
from January 1, 2004, to June 30, 2019. FAERS is updated quarterly by the FDA, and it is one of the most extensive public databases in the world. To mine the FAER
S, we used OpenVigil FDA, a validated pharmacovigilance tool, to retrieve FAERS data through the openFDA
application programming interface for evaluating the
FDA drug-event database with the additional openFDA
duplicate detection and drug mapping functionality [10,
11], and it is used in many pharmacovigilance studies
[12, 13]. OpenVigil operates only on the cleaned FDA
data by deleting duplicates or reports with missing
data [11].
Definition of adverse events

Adverse events in the FAERS database are coded according to the preferred terms (PTs) derived from the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA)
terminology. Besides, different PTs can also be combined
to define a medical condition or area of interest through
an algorithmic approach known as the Standardized
MedDRA Queries (SMQs). The SMQs and PTs are extensively accepted and used in FAERS data analysis.
Disproportionality analyses

As a fundamental analytic method of pharmacovigilance,
disproportionality analysis, which compares the proportion of occurring AEs between a specific drug and all

Page 2 of 8

other drugs, was applied to identify drug-associated adverse events as signals [14].
Firstly, we conducted a disproportionality analysis
using all existing narrow SMQs to map the safety profiles of DPP-4is. Key toxicities that emerged from events
with significant disproportionality in the first step were
characterized in terms of specific signs/symptoms (PT
level). Further disproportionality analysis of PT levels
was based on the signal strength, literature and number
of reported AEs associated with DPP-4is in different systems to examine the safety profile of DPP-4is [12].
To mitigate the confounding effects of “indication
bias” (i.e., the indication for which the drug is prescribed
is reported as an AE), PTs and SMQs associated with
diabetes-related signs and complications were removed
from analysis.
In every FAERS AE report, role codes had been
assigned by reporters to each reported drug and indicated as either primary suspect drug, secondary suspect
drug, concomitant or interacting. In our study, a case/
non-case method was conducted for thedisproportionality analyses. Cases defined as AEs reports in which the
reporter mentioned DPP-4is as suspect (“Primary Suspect”, “Secondary Suspect” or “Concomitant”) were selected. To control for major reporting and confounders,
non-cases were selected by restricting the analysis to
AEs reports in which at least one antidiabetic agent (excluding insulins) was recorded (ATC code: A10B), the
so-called analysis by therapeutic area [15, 16].
In this study, the signals of disproportionate reporting
(SDR) were generated by calculating the reporting odds
ratio (ROR). ROR is a pharmacovigilance index that is
clear and easy to understand, and it is widely used in
epidemiological studies. The value ROR was calculated
using the equation (ROR = (a × d)/(b × c)) and expressed
as point estimates and its two-sides 95% confidence
interval (CI) (Supplementary Table 1). When a specific
drug is more likely to induce a specific AE than all other
drugs, it would typically receive a higher ROR value due
to higher disproportionality. SDR is considered significant when the lower limit of the 95% CI of the ROR estimates is higher than one and at least three cases of
interest reported [17]. The analyses were conducted
using the Microsoft EXCEL 2010 and SPSS 23.0 statistical software.

Results
During the study period, the FAERS database received
9706 DPP-4i-associated adverse event reports (AERs):
680 for saxagliptin, 7811 for sitagliptin, 802 for linagliptin, 347 for vildagliptin, and 66 for alogliptin. Because
the total number of adverse events occurring with alogliptin was not large enough to compare the association
with adverse events of the other four DPP-4is, alogliptin

was excluded from further analysis [4]. Table 1 shows
event numbers and patient demographic characteristics
due to these adverse events.
Table 2 lists the SMQs most frequently reported with
the use of saxagliptin, sitagliptin, linagliptin, and vildagliptin, which were ranked according to the number of reports. Considering DPP-4is as a class, SDR emerged in 13
SMQs: “gastrointestinal nonspecific inflammation and
dysfunctional conditions”, “hypersensitivity”, “acute pancreatitis”, “haemodynamic oedema, effusions and fluid
overload”, “malignancies”, “noninfectious diarrhoea”, “angioedema”, “hepatic disorders”, “arthritis”, “gastrointestinal
perforation, ulceration, haemorrhage or obstruction”, “severe cutaneous adverse reactions”, “taste and smell disorders” and “anaphylactic reaction”. The SDR was most
commonly observed in the following systems/organs:
gastrointestinal, hepatic, musculoskeletal, malignancies,
pancreas, hypersensitivity, and skin. The following five
SMQs emerged statistically significantly in these four
agents RORs in: “gastrointestinal nonspecific inflammation and dysfunctional conditions”, “hypersensitivity”, “severe cutaneous adverse reactions” and “noninfectious
diarrhoea”.
Then the combined analysis of FAERS data with literature reviews identified 30 PTs (involved in eight systems/organs), which were further explored. We found
statistically-significant RORs for eight organs/systems
of AEs, including gastrointestinal, pancreatitis, malignancies, infection, musculoskeletal, general disorders,
hypersensitivity, and skin AEs. Furthermore, a signal
was not detected for cardiopathy (Table 3).

Discussion
In this study, AERs submitted to the FAERS database
were reviewed to determine the safety profiles of DPP4is. A lot of clinical trials were conducted to evaluate the
safety of DPP-4i, and the results varied with study parameters. Overall, the results obtained herein were consistent with clinical trials, suggesting the usefulness of
the FAERS database and the data mining methods.
Tissues that strongly express DPP-4 include the heart
and blood vessels, muscle, exocrine pancreas, kidney,
and lymph nodes. The ability of DPP-4i to inhibit enzymes in the DPP- family [18] or an off-target effect of
the DPP-4i might be responsible for adverse drug
reactions.
Gastrointestinal intolerance presenting as nausea,
vomiting, diarrhoea, and dyspepsia [19–22] is one of the
most commonly reported adverse reactions for DPP-4
[23]. According to a published study, the incidence of
gastrointestinal adverse reactions was up to 12.2% [24].
The mechanism of DPP-4i associated gastrointestinal intolerance appears to be partially dependent on the motility effects of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) elevated by
DPP-4 inhibition and other gastric hormones, such as
pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating peptide, gastric inhibitory polypeptide, and oxyntomodulin [25]. These
drug-associated adverse event signals were detected for
the four DPP-4is.
Significant signals of acute pancreatitis were detected
in the four DPP-4is; significant signals of pancreatic carcinoma were also detected in DPP-4i(as a class) and sitagliptin, linagliptin (as a single drug). Consistent with our

study, several animal studies, cases, and clinical data,
suggested an increased risk of pancreatitis with the use
of these drugs [26, 27]. Another pharmacovigilance
study found DPP-4i is associated with an increased risk
of reported pancreatitis in France [9]. In Chen’s metaanalysis, an increased risk of acute pancreatitis was related to DDP-4i drugs in patients with type 2 diabetes
[28]. According to a population-based matched casecontrol study, the risk factors of DPP-4i associated pancreatitis were hypertriglyceridemia, alcohol use, gallstones, tobacco abuse, obesity, biliary and pancreatic
cancer, cystic fibrosis, and neoplasms [29]. On the other
hand, patients with T2DM generally have a higher risk
of acute pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer, mainly if
they suffer from chronic pancreatitis, which may explain
the significant signals detected in DPP-4is. Besides, the
risk of pancreatic cancer is much more challenging to
assess, given that it is hard to perform a much longer
follow-up in a clinical trial. Also, the ROR value is overestimated by the “notoriety bias” (increased reporting of
adverse drug events following safety alerts by regulatory
authorities) as a result of the FDA alerts [30]. Therefore,
it is difficult to assess the possible effect of DPP-4i. This
was also the conclusion of a recent assessment by the
US FDA and the European Medicines Agency, who further commented that while data provide reassurance,
pancreatitis will continue to be considered a risk associated with incretin-based therapies until more data are
available [26]. Given the potential risk of pancreatitis in
diabetic patients using DPP-4 inhibitors, pre-existing
risk factors for pancreatitis should be taken into account
when prescribing this type of medication.
DPP-4 enzyme has been implicated to have a direct
effect in T lymphocyte regulation [18], and DPP-4i
suppress mitogen-stimulated T-cell responses [31],
which leads to an increased incidence of infections
(e.g., upper respiratory tract infection, nasopharyngitis,
and urinary tract infection) [20, 32]. A case/non-case
study in the World Health Organization VigiBase indicates an increased reporting of the three infections
[33]. Similarly, our research suggests increased reporting of these infections and pneumonia for users of
DPP-4 inhibitors (as a class) compared with users of
other non-insulin antidiabetic drugs. Meta-analyses
suggested an increased risk for all-cause infections
[34, 35]. However, these results are questionable.
There are also systematic reviews and meta-analyses
indicated that no notable between-group differences
in incidence rates were observed for the three
infection-related adverse events [36, 37].
Consistent with previous disproportionality studies
[38], SDR was observed in arthralgia and myalgia. Besides, “pain in extremity” also showed significant disproportionality in our study. The underlying mechanism for

Page 6 of 8

these ADRs could be explained by the wide distribution
of DPP-4 in striated muscle. DPP-4i increases the levels
of P substance (thus decreasing the pain threshold) and
slightly increases endomorphin-2 levels [39]. For the
fracture, the observations that patients with T2DM are
at an increased risk of bone fractures have led to increased vigilance regarding these events and the interaction with various therapies, including the DPP-4i [40].
However, in the SAVOR-TIMI 53 trial, the risk was
similar in each treatment group [41], and a metaanalysis indicated that DPP-4i might reduce the risk of
bone fractures [42]. SDR was not detected for fracture in
our study. Therefore, the significant association was observed in the disproportionality analyses for musculoskeletal disorders, despite not being severe.
The effect of antidiabetic agents on cardiac outcomes
has been a matter of uncertainty for the past four decades [43]. Thus, in 2008 the FDA issued a guidance
document calling for the cardiovascular safety assessment of all new glucose-lowering therapies [44]. Early
pharmacovigilance research found an association for an
increased risk of reported cardiac disorders during DPP4i exposure [45]. In the SAVOR-TIMI 53 trials, saxagliptin increased hospitalization rate for heart failure (3.5%
versus 2.8%; hazard ratio, 1.27; 95% confidence interval,
1.07–1.51) in patients with T2DM [46]. Subsequently, a
meta-analysis and a large cohort study provided additional evidence that saxagliptin was not associated with
hospitalization for heart failure [47, 48]. Recent pharmacovigilance research indicated the association between
cardiac complications and DPP-4is was biased by stimulated reporting [8], and the risk of cardiac disorders related to DPP-4is was non-significant after adjusted.
Based on the molecular mechanism, DPP-4 inhibitors
play a critical role in vascular and vessel protection
through preventing cleavage of stem cell chemoattractant cytokine and enhancing the homing of endothelial
progenitor cells [49]. Our study did not detect the signals for cardiac disorders (cardiac failure, cardiac failure
congestive, and myocardial infarction), which agrees
with the clinical trial [46]. However, continued investigation is needed to define the results.
Postmarketing events of hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, rash, and angioedema, are reported
in the prescribing information of most DPP-4is [50].
And consistent with postmarket data, we found SDRs
for angioedema, pruritus, rash, rash generalized, and urticarial. Previous pharmacovigilance study in the VigiBase found disproportionality signal for an increased
risk of bullous pemphigoid during DPP-4 inhibitor exposure, similar to our study conducted in FAERS. The
author speculated that all DPP-4 inhibitors are selective
for the DPP-4 enzyme, and the affinity for the DPP-4 enzyme may contribute to the risk of bullous pemphigoid.

Huang et al. BMC Pharmacology and Toxicology

(2020) 21:68

The affinity data of a DPP-4i drug for the enzymes explain to some extent different levels of bullous pemphigoid reporting in our study (quantified as ROR) [7].
The FAERS database is considered a valuable tool;
however, some limitations inherent to spontaneous
reporting have been noted. First, the database is increasingly incomplete (e.g., missing patient demographic information), variable reporting rates over time, duplicate
reports, an unverified source of submitted data, inability,
and missing information [51]. To overcome the limitation, reports were cleaned before analysis. Second, there
are inherent limitations to establishing causal relationships, including the evaluation of events with high background rates, long latency periods, notoriety bias, or a
possible contribution by coexisting medical conditions
or comedications [46]. Also, reports from FAERS are
not medically confirmed, which may introduce reporter bias [52]. Therefore data mining does not provide sufficient evidence on causality and merely
suggests the necessity for practitioner vigilance. However, we attempted to alleviate this bias by limiting
the analysis to a population of patients with diabetes
(using non-insulin antidiabetic agents as proxy), which
presumably share at least a set of common risk factors. Despite some limitations inherent to spontaneous reporting, the FAERS database is a rich
resource. Data mining is one of the critical tools for
routine assessment and management of risks associated with marketed pharmaceutical products.

Conclusions
The safety profiles of sitagliptin, saxagliptin, linagliptin,
and vildagliptin were reviewed using AERs submitted to
the FAERS. Among non-insulin antidiabetics, DPP-4is
are associated with higher AEs reporting of the gastrointestinal tract, pancreatitis, malignancies, infection,
musculoskeletal system, general disorders, hypersensitivity and skin, corroborating clinical trial evidence.
Furthermore, a signal is not detected for cardiopathy
and fracture. Our findings need further validation and
should be interpreted with caution, given the limitations of the pharmacovigilance. However, for physicians, these possible associations should be aware, and
the patient’s comorbidities and history and potential
adverse effects of the medicine must be taken into consideration. Future research needs to focus on safety
concerns, especially the development of cancer and
pancreatitis. Finally, our study provides a better understanding of the safety profiles of DPP-4i in a pharmacovigilance way.
