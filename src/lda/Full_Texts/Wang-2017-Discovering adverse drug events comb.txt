Abstract
The use of multiple data sources has been preferred in the surveillance of adverse drug events due to shortcomings
of using only a single source. In this study, we proposed a framework where the ADEs associated with interested
drugs are systematically discovered from the FDA’s Adverse Event Reporting System (AERS), and then validated
through mining unstructured clinical notes from Electronic Medical Records (EMRs). This framework has two
features. First, a higher priority was given to clinical practice during signal detection and validation. Second, the
normalization by NLP facilitated the interoperation between AERS-DM and the EMR. To demonstrate this
methodology, we investigated potential ADEs associated with drugs (class level) for rheumatoid arthritis (RA)
patients. The results demonstrated the feasibility and sufficient accuracy of the framework. The framework can serve
as the interface between the informatics domain and the medical domain to facilitate ADE discovery.
Introduction
Adverse drug events (ADEs), referring to any undesirable effect of a drug beyond its anticipated therapeutic effects
occurring during clinical use1, are important public health concerns. Although randomized clinical trials (RCTs) are
considered a gold standard in identifying pre-marketing safety issues of drugs, there are some existing limitations,
primarily within experiments. These limitations can include insufficient patient number, homogeneous population,
short trial period and exclusion of patients with comorbid diseases. Therefore, it is well accepted that pre-marketing
RCTs may not detect all types of ADEs related to a particular drug in clinical practice.
In post-marketing surveillance for adverse drug events (ADEs), the FDA’s Adverse Event Reporting System
(AERS) has become an important resource. However, signals from AERS data may contain false positive results,
where an association between the drug and ADE is incorrectly identified, as well as false negative results, where a
true association or signal is missed. Other data sources have been studied aiming for ADE detection, such as the
secondary use of Electronic Medical Records (EMRs) for further validation or comparison of ADEs, which has been
paid much attention. EMRs contain rich information in unstructured clinical notes that cannot be overlooked2.
Recently, Natural language processing (NLP) has been used to extract drug-ADE pairs for signal detection through
χ2 test3. The efficacy of mining EMRs for drug-ADE relationship has also been proven4. As a demonstration that
combining AERS with EHRs can improve the accuracy of ADE signal detection, an approach was proposed to
produce a highly selective ranked set of candidate ADEs from both AERS and EMRs based on proportionality
analysis5. This study could systematically discover ADEs and apply to very general scenarios.
In this study, we proposed a framework where the ADEs associated with interested drugs are discovered from FDA
AERS, and then validated through mining unstructured clinical notes where clinical priorities are given in terms of
cohort selection and result analysis. To demonstrate the methodology, we investigate potential ADEs associated
with drugs (class level) for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients.
Background
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is the most common type of arthritis in adults in the United States6. Conventional diseasemodifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs), including methotrexate (MTX), sulfasalazine, and leflunomide, have
been the cornerstone of the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Recently biological agents (biologics), for
example etanercept, demonstrated major therapeutic advances in treating RA patients7.
In clinical practice, the safety of medications for RA patients is an important issue. Many studies focus on adverse
drug events (ADEs) associated with either DMARDs or biologics, or their combination, through randomized
controlled trials (RCTs)8, clinical trials9, systematic reviews10, meta-analysis11, and chart reviews12. Because RCTs or

95

clinical trials are not able to reveal all potential ADEs due to experimental limits, post-marketing surveillance
becomes an important means of evaluating drug safety. The FDA Adverse Event Reporting System has been used
for the discovery of ADEs associated with biologics for RA, mainly aiming at specific ADEs, i.e., ischaemic
colitis13,T-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas13, neurological events14, and pneumocystis15. In one study, several data
sources were used to compare the magnitude of serious adverse events (SAEs) observed in post-marketing reports of
tocilizumab (TCZ), one of the biologics for RA patients 16. However, ADEs are not systematically discovered.
Interested ADEs included only serious hepatic events, gastrointestinal perforation, and cardiovascular events
(myocardial infarction and stroke). In this study, we aim to systematically discover ADEs associated with two drug
classes (conventional DMARDs and biologics) based on the framework we propose.
Materials and Methods
Figure 1 shows the framework for ADE mining from FDA’s AERS and EMRs that includes three steps:
preprocessing, signal detection and validation. In preprocessing, NLP was conducted for clinical notes in the EMRs.
During the signal detection, interested drugs were first identified from the AERS data mining set (AERS-DM), and
then data mining algorithms such as reporting odds ratios (ROR) were conducted to generate potential ADE signals.
For the EMRs, interested drugs, the cohort on interested drugs, and outcomes were identified, and then the outcomes
before drug use were removed. Lastly, the overlap between ADE signals and outcomes from EMR was further
investigated to discover potential ADEs. The details are shown below.

Figure 1. Framework for ADE mining from FDA AERS and EMRs
Data Sources
The FDA’s AERS is a database supporting the post-marketing safety surveillance for drug and therapeutic biologic
products 17. However, this database contains redundant data where drugs can also be registered by arbitrary names,
including trade names, abbreviations, and even typographical errors. In order to make it convenient for complicated
downstream analysis, we previously produced a normalized knowledge-enhanced data mining set based on AERS,
i.e., AERS-DM18. Three steps were conducted: de-duplication, drug normalization, and data aggregation. First,

96

redundant reports were removed as suggested by the FDA. This procedure removed multiple reports of the same
event. Second, FAERS drug names, along with administration route and dose information, were normalized using a
natural language processing (NLP) tool MedEx 19 to RxNorm, a standardized nomenclature for clinical drugs and
drug delivery devices 20. Meanwhile, adverse event terms were mapped to Medical Dictionary for Regulatory
Activities (MedDRA)’s preferred term (PT) code and classified into MedDRA System Organ Class (SOC) 21. Third,
adverse events were aggregated according to MedDRA SOC and PT codes, and drugs were aggregated based on
National Drug File–Reference Terminology (NDF-RT) classification information through RxNorm 22.
We processed FAERS data from 2004 through 2011 into AERS-DM, which contains 37,029,228 ADE records. In
total, 74% of FAERS unique drug names were normalized to 14,489 unique RxNorm concepts, of which 10,221
(71%) were classified in NDF-RT. The datasets of AERS-DM can be downloaded from the website
http://informatics.mayo.edu/adepedia/index.php/Download.
EMR clinical notes in our study consist of a cohort of Employee and Community Health (ECH) patients receiving
their primary care at Mayo Clinic over a period of 15 years (1998–2013). This cohort include 138,000 patients and
covers both inpatient and outpatient settings. Problems (outcomes) in those notes are generally entries which are
itemized as either phrases (e.g., Allergic rhinitis/vasomotor rhinitis) or short sentences (e.g, Her asthma appeared to
be very mild). In this study, we chose sections related to diagnosis and lab tests for ADE detection.
Preprocessing
To align with the meaningful use requirement, the CORE Problem List Subset was created to better implement
Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine Clinical Terms (SNOMED CT) in EMRs 23. The CORE Problem List
Subset offers a good coverage of frequently used terms in problem lists 23. In a previous study 24, we assessed the
coverage of SNOMED CT for codifying problem lists in narrative format by extracting itemized entries from
clinical notes 25. In this study, we normalized them to the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) concepts. We
applied the same methodology but kept UMLS concepts that can be mapped to the CORE Problem List Subset
codes (the August 2015 version of The CORE Problem List Subset of SNOMED CT was used). Then MedXN was
used for the normalization of medications in this cohort to RxNorm codes26.
Signal detection
DMARDs and biologics are two drug classes for the treatment of RA. DMARDs include methotrexate, leflunomide,
hydroxychloroquine and sulfasalazine. Biologics include abatacept, adalimumab, anakinra, certolizumab, etanercept,
golimumab, infliximab, rituximab, tocilizumab and tofacitinib.
From AERS-DM, RxNorm codes of these generic ingredients were used to extract records. Drug indications were
limited for RA patients. The data mining method reporting odds ratio (ROR) was used to detect associations
between drug class DMARDs, biologic use, and ADEs. The calculation of ROR is based on a 2×2 contingency table
27, 28
. The number of reports with drug class and ADE is defined as a. The number of reports with drug class and
without ADE is defined as b. The number of reports with drugs other than this drug class and with ADE is defined
as c. The number of reports with drugs other drug class and without ADE is defined as d. In this analysis, the lower
bound of the 95% confidence interval of the ROR was used29. R package PhViD 1.0.6 was used for signal
detection30.

ROR =

a×d
b×c

From the normalized data of clinical notes in EMRs, first, synonyms of RA from UMLS were used to identify RA
patients, i.e., rheumatoid arthritis or polyarthritis rheumatic. Associated medications, prescription date, and
diagnosis date were also extracted. Second, patient cohorts were identified in consideration of clinical priorities
based on interested drugs and indications. To study the drug class DMARDs, we identified the cohort of RA patients
as those who took any drug in the DMARDs class without drugs of biologics. According to the 2015 American
College of Rheumatology Guideline for the Treatment of Rheumatoid Arthritis, conventional DMARDs are usually
used for early RA patients, while biologics are often used for moderate or high disease activity, combining with or
without DMARDs31. To study the drug class biologics, we identified another cohort of RA patients as those who
took any drugs within the biologics class, no matter if a drug in the DMARDs class was used in combination. This is
also simulating the condition from AERS-DM where data mining of biologics for RA did not consider if DMARSs
were used in combination. Therefore, two different cohorts were used for two drug classes. Third, the outcomes of

97

patients from the two cohorts were identified respectively. Forth, outcomes before the administration of interested
drugs were removed to obtain possible ADE signals, i.e., possible consequences of interested drugs.
Validation
After obtaining signals associated with DMARDs and biologics from AERS-DM, MedDRA PT codes were mapped
to 2012AB UMLS concepts. The overlapping signals for the two drug classes were further analyzed through
mapping PT terms to System Organ Class (SOC) terms. For each drug class, we manually compared the overlapping
signals to filter confirmed ADEs from package inserts, and then complications and other confounding factors were
filtered to reveal potential ADEs. Some examples were shown using top overlaps of outcomes associated with
biologics and DMARDs chosen according to the criteria of ROR more than 2, reporting number in AERS-DM more
than 5, and incidence from EMR more than 5%.
Results
In total, there were 497 unique patients with an RA (or synonyms) diagnosis who took only DMARDs, and 365
unique patients with an RA (or synonyms) diagnosis who took biologics no matter if DMARDs were coadministered. Table 1 shows signals from AERS-DM and outcomes from clinical notes. More signals were detected
for biologics (152) from both AERS-DM and clinical notes than DMARDs (147).

The overlapping signals for the two drug classes were further analyzed through mapping PT terms to System Organ
Class (SOC) terms. Table 2 shows the number of PT terms (signals) for DMARDs and biologics mapping to SOC.
Potential ADEs associated with biologics were involved in more SOCs than those with DMARDs, and the top 6
SOCs were in the same order for potential ADEs associated with both drug classes.

For each drug class, we manually compared the overlapping signals with confirmed ADEs from package inserts.
Table 3 shows the analysis results. Signals were divided into four categories, the first is confirmed ADEs or signs of
ADEs in package inserts such as “vasculitis” for biologics, the second is complications of RA such as
“osteoporosis”, the third is treatments such as “appendectomy”, and the forth is potential ADEs such as
“hyperkeratosis” for biologics.

Discussion
In this study, we demonstrated the framework by exploring potential ADEs associated with drugs for RA patients.
ADEs associated with drug class DMARDs and biologics for RA patients were first systematically mined from
AERS-DM. Corpuses of RA patients on each drug class were then carefully selected according to the clinical
guidelines. Following that, outcomes following drug uses were revealed from unstructured EMRs, and the overlaps
between the signals and the outcomes of RA patients on these drugs were further analyzed to identify potential
ADEs. RA is a systemic autoimmune disease with the characteristics of chronic inflammation that results in a

100

destructive polyarthritis. Many complications may occur after RA. Therefore, we fully considered the features of
RA to exclude possible complications from overlaps between signals from AERS-DM and outcomes from EMRs.
In view of various regimens used among different institutions, some drugs used in one institution may not be used in
another. EMR data from only a single institution, i.e., Mayo Clinic, was used in this study. To avoid omitting
information on drugs and indications, our method doesn’t aim for screening whole databases as done in the previous
5
study . Instead, demonstrated as a framework interfacing informatics domain and medical domain, it employed more
refined strategies based on interested drugs and indications. In the future, we will develop more general
methodology once EMR data from multiple institutions, such as Optum lab, can be obtained.
Some adverse events occur after a short time following drug use, from several minutes to several hours. Others
occur only after several days, weeks, months or even years of exposure 4. Therefore, when extracting outcomes, we
have not limited the time of outcome occurrence after drug use. This allows detection of late-onset events. However,
it may be interesting to observe the difference of time of outcome occurrences in the future.
During the result analysis, we found that potential ADEs such as “Endometrial cancer” and “bladder neoplasm” for
conventional DMARDs could also be the natural consequences of RA. Because the disease is a systemic
autoimmune disease, patients with RA are at an increased risk for cancer32. In the future, we will integrate casecontrol study design into the framework based on EMR data to further discriminate such potential ADEs from comorbidities with indications of interested drugs.
Conclusions
We proposed a framework for discovering potential ADEs associated with drugs combining both FDA AERS and
EMRs. This framework has two features. First, more priority was given to clinical practice. Second, the
normalization by NLP facilitated the interoperation between AERS-DM and EMRs. The results demonstrated the
feasibility and sufficient accuracy of the framework. The framework can serve as the interface between the
informatics domain and the medical domain to facilitate ADE discovery.
