Event Reporting System (VAERS)

Abstract

Background: Vaccines are administered differentially according to age and sex,
and disease patterns also vary among people of different age and sex groups.
Estimates of disproportionality should be calculated based on comparisons of
groups that have a similar likelihood of receiving similar vaccines and experiencing similar adverse events, to prevent false disproportionality from occurring.
Stratified empirical Bayesian (EB) methods have been compared with crude, but
not stratified, proportional reporting ratios (PRRs) in their performance on
adverse event data.
Objectives: (i) to implement stratification of PRR; (ii) to quantify and compare
vaccine-event pairs that are highlighted by PRR and EB05 (the lower bound of the
90% CI of the EB geometric mean), for both crude and stratified; and (iii) to
evaluate the effects of stratification by age and sex, in identifying adverse events
that are accepted to be caused by vaccines.
Methods: We applied EB and PRR data mining methods to data from the US
Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). We stratified PRR and
EB05 by age and sex. To study the effects of stratification, we compared the crude
PRR and stratified PRR. We also assessed the crude EB05 and stratified EB05,
and then compared the effects of stratification on EB05 and PRR.
Results: Stratification not only changed the number of vaccine-event pairs that
were highlighted, but also changed which pairs were highlighted. There were 283
vaccine-event pairs that were highlighted by the crude EB05, but not the stratified;
12 that were highlighted by the stratified EB05, but not the crude; and 162 that
were highlighted by both. Similarly, there were 701 vaccine-event pairs that were
highlighted by the crude PRR, but not the stratified; 139 that were highlighted by
the stratified PRR, but not the crude; and 895 that were highlighted by both. There
were 1466 vaccine-event pairs in which the effect of stratification was different
for EB05 and PRR.

Conclusion: To our knowledge, this is the first published analysis using stratified
PRRs. In this analysis of passive surveillance data, stratification revealed and
reduced confounding in EB and PRR, and also unmasked some vaccine-event
pairs that the crude values did not highlight. Stratification should be applied if
confounding is suspected. By decreasing the total number of highlighted vaccineevent pairs, stratification is likely to increase efficiency and therefore might
reduce workload.

1. Background
Empirical Bayesian (EB) and proportional reporting ratio (PRR), as applied to vaccine safety
monitoring, are data mining methods that attempt to
identify adverse events that are reported more commonly for one vaccine than others. PRR compares
proportions of reported adverse events for a particular vaccine with proportions for other vaccines.[1]
An event with a higher proportion for a particular
vaccine than for other vaccines might warrant further investigation. Some of the elevated values
might require further evaluation to determine
whether they are of sufficient concern to be ‘signals’
of possible vaccine reactions.[2] The EB methods also provide a measure of disproportionality of
vaccine-adverse event pairs while also incorporating
certain statistical adjustments.[3] Elevated data mining statistics do not necessarily reflect a causal relationship between a vaccine and an adverse event, but
when combined with traditional methods of adverse
event evaluation, they may be useful for generating
hypotheses that can be tested with controlled study
methods.[4-7]
The ability of EB methods to identify some
known adverse events of drugs[3,8] and vaccines[9]
has been demonstrated. In routine use at the US
FDA, PRR has identified events of interest after
smallpox,[10] typhoid,[11] and hepatitis A-B combination vaccines[12] from the Vaccine Adverse Event
Reporting System (VAERS). Stratified EB values
have been compared with crude, but not stratified,

data.[13] Conclusions drawn from such an evaluation
of the performance of one method compared with
the other are limited. We sought to contribute to
filling this apparent gap in the application of data
mining on postmarketing adverse event surveillance
data.
2. Objectives
The goals of this study were (i) to implement
stratification of PRR; (ii) to quantify and compare
vaccine-event pairs that are highlighted by the lower
bound of the 90% CI (EB05) of the EB geometric
mean (EBGM) and PRR, both crude and stratified;
and (iii) to evaluate the effects of stratification by
age and sex, in identifying adverse events that are
accepted to be caused by vaccines.
3. Study Design
3.1 The Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting
System (VAERS)

Established in 1990, VAERS is jointly managed
by the FDA and Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC) and receives 10 000–20 000 reports annually of adverse events following immunization. Uses of VAERS include detecting unrecognized adverse events, monitoring known reactions,
and vaccine lot surveillance.[4,5] Priorities for analysis of VAERS data include evaluating new vaccines for unexpected adverse events; reports of
death and other serious adverse events; and recognition and prevention of adverse effects.[7] Limitations

of spontaneous reporting systems, such as VAERS,
include the inability to verify reported diagnoses
easily, inconsistent data quality, under-reporting, inadequate denominator data and absence of an unvaccinated control group.[4,5] As a result of these limitations, analysis of VAERS data does not usually
allow determination of a causal relationship between a vaccine and an adverse event.[6]
The data source used is all VAERS reports
(n = 147 011) received from 1 July 1990 to 23 January 2003, encompassing 70 vaccine types and 989
adverse event terms coded using the Coding Symbols for a Thesaurus of Adverse Reaction Terms
(COSTARTs).
3.2 Data Mining Methods

The PRR identifies conditions that constitute a
larger proportion of reported events for a vaccine of
interest, compared with all the other vaccines in the
database. PRR is calculated as shown in figure
1.[1,14,15]
In this contingency table notation, the PRR for
vaccine i and COSTART j is:
PRRij =

a/(a + b)
c/(c + d)

A large PRR for a specific vaccine-COSTART
pair indicates that the COSTART has been disproportionately reported for that vaccine.
To define a vaccine-event pair that is highlighted
for further evaluation, we applied the screening criteria that Evans et al.[1] have proposed: count n
(denoted as a in the contingency table) ≥3, PRR ≥2
and Yates-corrected χ2 ≥4.

669

The EB method starts with the ratio of observedto-expected adverse events:[14]
a/(a + c)
(a + b)/(a + b + c + d)

For purposes of detecting vaccine-event pairs
that warrant further evaluation, the EBGM is
the main statistic generated by DuMouchel’s EB
algorithm,[3] which ‘shrinks’ the observed-to-expected ratio, thereby reducing the effect of sampling
variation in the data. The shrinkage is greatest when
n is small. EB provides information about not only
the disproportionality of a given association, but
also its variability;[3,14] PRR alone provides only the
disproportionality. Furthermore, EB takes into account multiple comparisons,[3,14] whereas PRR does
not. Szarfman et al.[8] have used the EB05, instead of
the EBGM, based on their experience that EB05 ≥2,
“ensures with a high degree of confidence that,
regardless of count size, the particular drug-event
combination is being reported at least twice as often
as it would be if there were no association between
the drug and the event”.[8] We use this cut-off of
EB05 ≥2 to define vaccine-event pairs that are highlighted for further evaluation.
3.3 Stratification

Through stratification, traditional epidemiological analysis accounts for factors that are related to
both the exposure and the outcome. It is plausible
that such adjustment will be needed in data mining
analysis. Vaccines are administered differentially
according to age (e.g. children receive Haemophilus
influenzae vaccine, or HIBV, but adults generally do
not), and the spectrum of adverse events, signs,
symptoms and diseases in children is different from
that in adults (e.g. sudden infant death syndrome
[SIDS] among children). Similarly, may influence
vaccine administration (e.g. more men may receive
anthrax vaccine because of their military deployment status), and background disease patterns differ
between men and women (e.g. autoimmune condiDrug Safety 2008; 31 (8)

670

tions are more common among women). These patterns may influence the vaccine-event pairs that are
reported to VAERS. Accordingly, estimates of disproportionality should be calculated based on comparisons of groups that have a similar likelihood of
receiving similar vaccines and experiencing similar
adverse events to prevent false disproportionality
from occurring. Stratifying by age and gender partly
controls for such factors.[16]
In this paper, we compared the EB05 and PRR,
both crude and stratified by age and sex. Methods
for calculating summary EB05, including stratification, are described elsewhere.[8] To calculate summary PRRs for stratified analysis, we applied the
Mantel-Haenszel method[17] and incorporated it into
Statistical Analysis Systems (SAS) code (SAS version 9.1, Cary, NC, USA). For each age-sex stratum,
a 2 × 2 contingency table of exposure (vaccine type)
and outcome (COSTART) was created, and counts
from all strata were used to calculate the stratified
(weighted) value of PRR, as well as a summary χ2
statistic.[17] Data were stratified by the age
(<2, 2–17, 18–64, ≥65 years or unknown) and sex
(female, male or unknown) listed on the VAERS
report. The age strata were selected on the basis of
both vaccine administration and adverse event patterns.
To study the effects of stratification by age and
sex, we compared the crude PRR and stratified PRR.
We also compared the crude EB05 and stratified
EB05 values. We then assessed the effects of stratification on EB05 and PRR by displaying the results
for known vaccine-event associations. The Vaccine
Injury Table is a list of vaccine adverse event associations that the Institute of Medicine has determined are causal.[18] We operationalized these associations as vaccine-COSTART pairs and compared, for each data mining method, the crude and
stratified data mining values for those pairs. Such
operationalization is imperfect, since COSTARTs
are applied without standardized definitions or diag© 2008 Adis Data Information BV. All rights reserved.

nostic confirmation (e.g. ‘arthritis’) may refer to
acute or chronic inflammation of joints). However,
for the purpose of data mining, COSTARTs have
been shown to be useful for highlighting associations that warrant further investigation.[9-12]
4. Results
Of 69 230 theoretical vaccine-event pairs (70
vaccines × 989 event terms), at the time of this
analysis, VAERS contained 14 800 vaccine-event
pairs with at least one report. Stratification not only
changes the number of vaccine-event pairs that are
highlighted, but also changes which pairs are identified (figure 2 and figure 3). For example, there are
12 vaccine-event pairs that are highlighted by the
stratified EB05, but not the crude; 283 that are
highlighted by the crude EB05, but not the stratified;
and 162 that are highlighted by both (figure 2; figure
3, rows 2–4). Similarly, there are 139 vaccine-event
pairs that are highlighted by the stratified PRR, but
not the crude; 701 that are highlighted by the crude
PRR, but not the stratified; and 895 that are highlighted by both (figure 2; figure 3, columns 2–4).
Figure 3 displays all 16 possible combinations of
highlighting by PRR (both stratified and crude) and
EB05 (both stratified and crude). The diagonal that

extends from column 1, row 1 to column 4, row 4
includes a total of 13 334 vaccine-event pairs for
which stratification has the same effect on both PRR
and EB05; these cells represent 90% of the total
14 800 vaccine-event pairs. For 13 065 (the vast
majority), the crude PRR and crude EB05 do not
highlight the pair as deserving further investigation,
and stratification does not change that result in
either method. There are no instances in which both
of the stratified values highlight the pair but the two
crude values do not (column 2, row 2). Stratification
reduces the total number of highlighted pairs from
1596 to 1034 for PRR (35% reduction) and from 445
to 174 for EB05 (61% reduction). In 108 instances
(column 3, row 3), the crude PRR and crude EB05
highlight the pair, but in both methods the vaccineevent pair is not highlighted after stratification. In
161 instances (column 4, row 4), crude and stratified
PRR, as well as crude and stratified EB05, highlight
the vaccine-event pair for further evaluation.
There are 1466 vaccine-event pairs for which
either the crude or the stratified results for EB05 or
PRR were discordant. In the first row, columns 2–4
reveal that PRR – whether stratified or not – highlights vaccine-event pairs that neither the crude

EB05 nor stratified EB05 highlights. In contrast, no
such effect is seen in rows 2–4 of the first column.
Column 4 reveals that, even when both the crude
and stratified PRR highlight a vaccine-event pair,
discrepancies among crude EB05 and stratified
EB05 exist: there are 12 pairs that the stratified
EB05 highlights, but the crude does not, and there
are 175 pairs that the crude EB05 highlights, but the
stratified does not. Moreover, row 2 illustrates that,
for 12 vaccine-event pairs, the stratified EB05 was
highlighted, but the crude was not. Similarly, column 2 indicates that, for 139 vaccine-event pairs,
the stratified PRR was highlighted, but the crude
was not.
Table I lists specific examples of the effects of
stratification on EB05 and PRR for vaccine adverse
events that the Institute of Medicine has determined
are causal.[18] For rotavirus vaccine and intussusception, as well as rubella vaccine and arthritis, both of
the stratified values are lower than the crude, but are
still highlighted for further evaluation. For diphtheria and tetanus toxoids adsorbed paediatric vaccine
and anaphylaxis, as well as measles, mumps and
rubella virus vaccine live (MMR) and thrombocytopenia, stratification decreases both EB05 and PRR;

The summary PRR for arthritis and MMR is 1.548 (n = 183, χ2 = 28.04) and therefore does not meet the screening criteria of n ≥3,
PRR ≥2, and χ2 ≥4. However, for some of the age and sex strata, all three criteria are fulfilled.

PRR = proportional reporting ratio.

Table II displays the data mining values for age
and sex strata for MMR vaccine and arthritis. Although the summary PRR does not meet the screening criteria, the values for females and males under
2 years old, as well as women 18–64 years old, fulfil
all three screening criteria.
5. Discussion and Conclusions
EB methods have been compared with crude
PRR in their performance on drug adverse event
data.[13] To our knowledge, this is the first published
analysis of the comparative effects of stratification
on PRR and EB05 for the analysis of passive surveillance data. The possibility that stratification by
potential confounders, such as age and sex, might
improve the utility of data mining makes intuitive
sense and deserves further exploration.
We sought to describe the effects of stratification
on EB05 and PRR. The vast majority of vaccineevent pairs are not highlighted by either method,
regardless of stratification. In addition, our results
demonstrate concordance for 161 pairs that are highlighted by all four metrics (crude and stratified PRR,
and crude and stratified EB05). There were 1466
vaccine-event pairs for which either the crude or
stratified results were different for EB05 or PRR. In
some cases, such as poliomyelitis after OPV, the
effect of stratification on PRR and EB05 was opposite: stratification increased the PRR, but decreased
the EB05, even though all four values highlighted

the association. This disparity may relate to statistical differences between the methods.[14]
For both EB05 and PRR, stratification reduced
the number of pairs that were highlighted. Of those
pairs that were highlighted by the crude, more than
one-third disappeared after stratification. By decreasing the total number of highlighted vaccineevent pairs, stratification likely increased efficiency
and might therefore reduce workload. Stratification
revealed and reduced confounding in EB05 and
PRR; the disappearance of highlighted vaccineevent pairs after stratification suggests that age and
sex are confounders for those associations. The finding that stratification highlighted some vaccineevent pairs that the crude values did not (12 for
EB05 and 139 for PRR) suggests that unmasking or
negative confounding can occur.
Data mining does not establish causality of adverse events,[2] nor does it always detect accepted
vaccine adverse events (table I). PRR and other data
mining statistics should not be interpreted or presented as ‘relative risks’ of specific vaccine adverse
events. Data mining statistics should be utilized only
for generating hypotheses that can be tested with
controlled study methods.[19]
This analysis of passive surveillance data suggests that stratification should be applied to both
PRR and EB data mining methods if confounding is
suspected. Also, analysis of individual strata may
reveal important patterns, particularly if there is a

large imbalance in the administration of vaccines or
in the baseline susceptibility to a given condition. As
we have demonstrated, the summary value for a data
mining metric might fall below a given threshold,
while the value for some age and sex strata might be
elevated. The importance of periodic analysis and
the ability to track changes over time has been
emphasized.[20] Stratifying by the year of report may
be considered in future analyses. With the recent
introduction of several vaccines that are intended for
adolescents, the selection of different age strata
might also be desirable.
