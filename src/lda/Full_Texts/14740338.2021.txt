ABSTRACT

Backgrounds: Acute pancreatitis (AP) has been reported in patients treated with protease inhibitors
(PIs), but there are few real-world studies comparing the occurrence and characteristics of AP after
different PI regimens.
Research design and methods: Disproportionality analysis and Bayesian analysis were utilized for data
mining of the Food and Drug Administration’s Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database for
suspected adverse events involving AP after PI. The times to onset and fatality rates of AP following
different PI regimens were also compared.
Results: Based on 33,832 reports related to PIs, 285 cases were associated with AP, involving with 12
out of the 15 studied PIs. Of all the reported AP events related to PIs, 64.56% occurred in men and the
median time to onset of AP was 103 (IQR: 26–408) days after the initiation of PI treatment with a fatality
rate of 14.02%. Among all PI therapies, indinavir was notably associated with AP, and ritonavir and
lopinavir/ritonavir-induced AP cases appeared to be associated with a higher risk of death.
Conclusions: Most of PIs were associated with AP-related adverse events, among which indinavir has
a stronger association with AP but there is no significant difference in fatality rates.

1. Introduction
Protease inhibitor (PI)-based strategies have been adopted into
first-line antiretroviral (ARV) therapy [1,2]. The use of PIs in highly
active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has reduced HIV-associated
morbidity and mortality and improved the quality and prolonga­
tion of life in HIV-positive patients [3–5]. The introduction of PIs
started a new era of hepatitis C virus (HCV) treatment, with an
average above 95% sustained virological response (SVR) at least
for genotypes 1 and 4 [2,6]. PIs were also demonstrated to be
effective in treating pneumonia associated with severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [7] and middle
east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) [8,9], and are
potential therapeutics for coronavirus disease 2019 for the inhibi­
tion effect on virus replication [10]. However, the rates of severe
side effects were reported to be high following treatment with PIs,
which impeded the use of PIs to a certain extent [2,11].
Several adverse effects were reported following treatment
with PIs, such as hyperlipidemia, hyperglycemia, lipodystro­
phy, gastrointestinal (GI) side effects (nausea, vomiting, or
diarrhea), rash, renal colic, dry skin, and paronychia, QT inter­
val prolongation [11,12]. In general, PI-based treatments are
associated with changes in the distribution of body fat and
metabolic disorders, such as insulin resistance, hypercholester­
olemia, and hypertriglyceridemia [13–16]. The latter is usually
severe and difficult to control and may trigger episodes of
acute pancreatitis (AP) [17]. PI-associated pancreatitis, some
cases of which were fatal, has been observed [18,19], and the

risk of severe pancreatitis induced by PI therapy has attracted
a great deal of attention. Previous studies have evaluated
whether the etiology of AP has changed since PI-based
HAART therapy was first introduced in 1996 [19–22].
However, previous studies have reported conflicting results
regarding the impact of PIs on the development of pancrea­
titis [17]. Moreover, most evidence supporting the causal rela­
tionship between AP and PIs has come from case reports [23–
25] and is insufficient to provide an overview of the risk of rare
adverse events such as AP.
Pharmacovigilance studies regarding PI-induced AP events
are still scarce. In particular, we still know little about the
safety profile of PI regimens in regard to pancreatitis in clinical
practice. Thus, characterizing PI-associated pancreatitis may
provide important clues for patient safety during ARV therapy.
By analyzing adverse events extracted from the FDA’s Adverse
Event Reporting System (FAERS) database, we focused on
evaluating and comparing the associations between various
PI regimens and AP in a large real-world patient population. In
addition, we investigated fatality rates and the times to onset
of AP after the administration of various PI regimens.

2. Patients and methods
2.1. Data source
We conducted a retrospective pharmacovigilance study using
the FAERS database data from January 2004 to

December 2019. The FAERS is a public voluntary spontaneous
reporting database that provides information on adverse
event and medication error reports submitted by health pro­
fessionals, consumers, and manufacturers both domestically
and abroad. No ethical issue is addressed as this study used
existing non-identifiable datasets.
The ASCII data files of the FARES database contain demo­
graphic and administrative information (DEMO), adverse event
(REAC), drug information (DRUG), outcomes (OUTC), report
sources (RPSR), therapy information (THER) and using indica­
tions (INDI).
A total of 13,649,428 reports were extracted from the
FAERS database. According to the FDA’s recommendations,
a deduplication procedure was performed to select the latest
FDA_DT with the same CASEIDs and select the higher
PRIMARYID when the CASEID and FDA_DT were the same,
resulting in 1,145,704 reports. According to the PRIMARYID
of the deduplicated DEMO data, the DRUG and REAC data
were deduplicated as well.

2.2. Adverse event and drug identification
All 21 preferred terms (PTs) describing adverse events, such as
‘Pancreatitis relapsing’ and ‘Pancreatitis acute’, in the REAC
files were investigated using the Medical Dictionary for
Regulatory Activities(MedDRA) V23.0 and the Standardized
MedDRA Queries (SMQ) term ‘acute pancreatitis’ (SMQ:
20,000,022).
Drug names can be input arbitrarily in the FAERS database;
therefore, MICROMEDEX® (Index Nominum) was utilized as
a dictionary for the names of PIs (Table 1). Both generic
names and brand names were used as keywords for FAERS
database retrieval.

algorithms were used to identify statistical associations
between a drug and an adverse event (Table 2) [26–34]. In
this study, adverse events were extracted when at least 1 of 4
indices met the criteria.
The associations between AP and different PI regimens
were compared. The time to onset of AP was evaluated for
each PI regimen. It was defined as the interval between the
EVENT_DT (adverse event onset date) and the START_DT (start
date of PI use). However, reports with input error (an
EVENT_DT earlier than the START_DT) or inaccurate date
entry were excluded. In addition, reports with fatal events
attributed to drug toxicity were counted, and the fatality
rate was calculated as the number of fatal events divided by
the total number of events of AP associated with each PI
regimen.

2.4. Statistical analysis
Descriptive analysis was used to summarize the clinical char­
acteristics of the patients with PI-associated AP collected from
the FAERS database. The times to onset of PI-associated AP
between different PI regimens were compared using nonpara­
metric tests (the Mann-Whitney test for dichotomous variables
and the Kruskal-Wallis test when there were more than two
subgroups of respondents) because the data were not nor­
mally distributed. Fatality rates among different PI regimens
were compared using Pearson’s chi-square test. The statistical
significance was determined at p < 0.05 with 95% confidence
intervals. Data mining and all statistical analyses were per­
formed with SAS, version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA).

to AP were recorded in the FAERS database between
January 2004 and December 2019. Among them, PIs were

and the clinical characteristics of these patients are presented
in Table 3.
The highest number of AP reports was associated with
ritonavir/dasabuvir/ombitasvir/paritaprevir (n = 64, 22.46%),
followed by ritonavir (n = 54, 18.95%), atazanavir (n = 52,
18.25%), lopinavir/ritonavir (n = 48, 16.84%), and darunavir
(n = 26, 9.12%). AP adverse events were most reported in HIVinfected patients (64.77%). Of these events, 64.56% occurred
in men, and 28.42% occurred in women; the gender was
unknown in 7.02% of the events. All but two events involved
adult patients (aged > 18 years), and the average age was
49.67 years. Most of the cases were from North America
(40.35%) and Europe (30.88%) and were mainly submitted by
health care professionals (71.93%).

3.2. Disproportionality analysis and Bayesian analysis
No cooccurrence of atazanavir/cobicistat use and AP was
reported, and only 1 and 2 cooccurrences of PI use and AP
were reported for darunavir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir
and darunavir/cobicistat, respectively. Overall, according to
the criteria for the 4 algorithms, 12 out of 15 PIs (all except
the ones mentioned above) were suggested to be associated
with AP. The results are listed in Table 4. Among all PI thera­
pies, indinavir was notably associated with AP because it had
the highest ROR, PRR, IC, and EBGM.

3.3. Time to onset of PI-associated AP
The overall median time to event onset of PI-related AP was
103 (interquartile range [IQR]: 26–408) days. For ritonavir,
lopinavir/ritonavir, darunavir and nelfinavir, the median times
to onset were 177 (IQR: 56–539) days, 91 (IQR: 22–352.5) days,
311 (IQR: 235–481.5) days and 918 (IQR: 469–2132) days,
respectively. The times to onset associated with each PI regi­
men are shown in Figure 1.
Interestingly, in some reports, AP-related adverse events
occurred as soon as after the first dose of several PIs, including

in the times to onset among these PI therapies (p= 0.0048).
Patients treated with ritonavir/dasabuvir/ombitasvir/paritapre­
vir appeared to have an earlier onset of AP than those receiv­
ing atazanavir (31 [IQR: 17–68.25] days vs 187.5 [IQR:

3.4. Fatality due to PI-associated AP
To evaluate the prognosis of AP after PI use, we assessed
fatality rates due to AP-related adverse events following var­
ious PI regimens, and the results are shown in Table 5.
Fatalities occurred in 38 (14.02%) of 271 reported PI-induced
AP cases. There was no significant difference in fatality rates
across different PI regimens (Pearson’s chi-square test for over­
all comparisons, p= 0.730).

4. Discussion
To our knowledge, this is the first study to focus on the
occurrence, timing, and prognosis of AP following the use of
various PI regimens in real-world practice based on the FAERS
pharmacovigilance database. Our results showed that 12 out
of the 15 studied PIs, including lopinavir/ritonavir, darunavir
and nelfinavir, were associated with AP-related adverse events.
By using disproportionality analysis and Bayesian analysis as
a rapid and effective signal detection method to perform the
largest-to-date post-marketing surveillance of these PIs, we
provided valuable and timely signals for clinical evaluation to
minimize the potential harm induced by AP following treat­
ment with PIs in this study.
Despite the excellent treatment efficacy in ARV therapy, the
use of PIs may be accompanied by serious side effects, includ­
ing AP. Two case reports [23,24]have suggested a causal
mechanism between PI-induced hypertriglyceridemia and AP,

while a third case report of PI-associated AP was not asso­
ciated with a rise in serum triglycerides [25]. It remains unclear
whether PIs are associated with pancreatitis. Hence, it is
important to recognize the clinical features of the associations
between PI regimens and AP and develop an awareness of this
adverse event among practitioners prescribing PIs. However,
the assessment of PI-associated AP is quite challenging
because of its low incidence and overlooked manifestations
[21,22]. Due to strict study entry criteria, relatively small sam­
ple sizes, and a finite scope and time frame, it is difficult to
achieve this goal through experimental studies, including
mandatory clinical trials, alone. Thus, performing postmarketing surveillance is an efficient way to discover rare
but potentially severe adverse reactions and help us acquire
vital basis for prevention. Therefore, our present study

EXPERT OPINION ON DRUG SAFETY

provides a profile of PI-associated AP through data mining of
33,832 adverse events related to PIs documented in the FAERS
database.
Some prior studies that included patients receiving HAART
found an association between female gender and AP and
hypothesized that a smaller body weight might increase the
toxicity of nucleotide reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs)
[35,36]. However, Manfredi et al. found no association
between gender and the risk of AP related to PI-based
HAART exposure [21]. In the present study, based on reports
from the FAERS database, we found that PI-associated AP
seemed to predominately affect men rather than women
(64.56% vs. 28.42%). Most of these collected reports were
from North America (40.35%) and Europe (30.88%), where
women make up a smaller proportion of the HIV patient
population [37]. Therefore, we could not conclude that men
are more likely than women to suffer from AP following PI
regimens. Guo et al. also found that advanced age is a risk
factor for acute pancreatitis after a retrospective cohort study
of 4,972 patients with HIV infection, in which they found 159
cases of AP [38]. Conversely, we did not observe that PIinduced AP predominately affected elderly patients in the
present study (11.93% of patients ≥65 years vs. 53.68% of
patients < 65 years). On account of a lack of information in
the FAERS database, it was difficult to control confounding
factors such as age in this study. Further research is needed to
explore the association between advanced age and the inci­
dence of PI-related AP. Further research is required to reeval­
uate the relationship between PI-associated AP and advanced
age as well as gender.
Previous studies have reported conflicting results regarding
the impact of PIs on the development of pancreatitis [17].
Most evidence supporting the causal relationship between
AP and PIs has come from case reports [23–25] and is insuffi­
cient to provide an overview of the risk of rare adverse events
such as AP. Riedel et al. found that neither PIs nor nonnucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) are asso­
ciated with an increased rate of AP through a ten-year cohort
study [39]. Conversely, based on the pharmacovigilance ana­
lysis in the present study, 12 out of the 15 studied PIs were
found to be associated with AP-related adverse events, which
is similar to what was reported in some prior studies [21,22].
Hypertriglyceridemia has been demonstrated to cause pan­
creatitis [40,41]. According to previous studies, all available
PIs are associated with significant increases in plasma trigly­
ceride concentrations [42,43], but hypertriglyceridemia is more
frequently observed following the use of ritonavir or lopinavir/
ritonavir combination therapy than following other PI-based
combinations [44,45]. Due to their potential clinicopathologi­
cal consequences, ritonavir and lopinavir/ritonavir regimens
may lead to an increased risk of hyperlipidemic pancreatitis
[42,46]. Surprisingly, we observed that indinavir, not ritonavir,
seemed to have the strongest association with AP among all PI
regimens, including ritonavir and lopinavir/ritonavir.
Considering the relatively limited cases of AP-associated indi­
navir reported (8 reports), this result needs, however, to be
validated on further study. In our study, the 64.77% of
reported cases are involving HIV-infected patients. As we
know, ARV treatment is very complex and dangerous due to

1113

concomitant medications and their toxic effects, including
drug-induced AP. There are plenty of factors which can affect
the pancreas, such as a previous history of AP, hepatobiliary
diseases, alcohol abuse, low CD4 counts, and opportunistic
infection prophylaxis, in addition to direct lesions caused by
HIV [17]. All these factors make the evaluation of the associa­
tion between PI and AP more difficult.
Our present study also found that the median time to the
onset of AP was 103 (IQR: 26–408) days after the initiation of PI
treatment, which was similar to the onset time observed in
some previous case reports [23–25]. Ritonavir/dasabuvir/ombi­
tasvir/paritaprevir appeared to have the earliest onset of AP
(31 [IQR: 17–68.25] days) among all studied PI regimens. For
ritonavir and lopinavir/ritonavir, the median times to onset
were 177 (IQR: 56–539) days and 91 (IQR: 22–352.5) days
respectively, suggesting that ritonavir-based PI regimens may
induce AP earlier than other PI regimens. Although the onset
of AP after the use of PIs seemed to be long according to
some reports collected in this study, AP could occur as soon as
after the first several doses of the ritonavir-based PI regimens
mentioned above and atazanavir. Thus, drug-induced AP
should be considered following treatment with PIs, if patients
present with clinical signs and symptoms of pancreatitis,
including abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and conjunction
with abnormal levels of serum lipase or/and amylase.
We also assessed and compared the fatality rates of AP
associated with PIs to investigate differences in the severity
of AP associated with various PIs. It was observed that AP
was generally associated with poor outcomes, exhibiting
a fatality rate of 14.02%, which was more than two times
that of a cohort study following 5,970 HIV-infected patients
[39]. In that study, five patients died of pancreatitis during
their hospitalization, yielding an in-hospital mortality rate of
5.9% for AP. As there is no consensus definition of acute
pancreatitis, the different inclusion criteria used in the two
studies may have resulted in different specificities and sen­
sitivities of case inclusion. This may have caused the differ­
ence between the fatality rates in the two studies.
Furthermore, we found that among all 271 reported PIinduced AP cases, compared with the other PIs, ritonavir
(18.87%) and lopinavir/ritonavir (22.73%) appeared to be
associated with a higher risk of death. However, based on
the collected data, there was no significant difference in
fatality rates across different PI regimens (Pearson’s chisquare test for overall comparison, p= 0.730). Fatal events
occurred in 1 (25.00%) of 4 patients treated with saquinavir
and 1 (20.00%) of 5 patients treated with nelfinavir; how­
ever, there were not enough cases reported to draw
a conclusion, and continued surveillance is needed.
Based on spontaneous reporting systems (SRSs), dispropor­
tionality analysis and Bayesian analysis allow for signal detection
rapidly and generate hypothesis about associations between AP
and various PI regimens. However, it should be noted that in
addition to many advantages, data mining techniques used in
this study still have several limitations. First, affected by the
inherent limitation of SRSs, sources of AP reports are nonhomogeneous. Incomplete reporting, underreporting, false
reporting, and inaccuracy might result in reporting bias and

even misleading [47]. Second, owing to a lack of insufficient
information in the FAERS database, the possibility of verification
of the clinical findings justifying the reported AP is quite limited,
and it is also scarcely possible to control such confounding
factors as indications, preexisting pancreatic diseases, comorbid­
ities or other factors which might have an impact on AP occur­
rence [48]. Third, as reports extracted from the FAERS database
do not reflect the total number of adverse reactions involving AP,
the number of reports for a particular PI may be influenced by
the extent of use of the product, which may be affected by some
factors such as enterprise publicity and product price [47,48].
Thus, it cannot be used to quantify the incidence of PI-associated
AP. Data mining techniques only provide a profile of PIassociated AP through signal detection. It is generally insufficient
to prove the causal relationship, which needs to be replicated
ideally by prospective studies [49].

5. Conclusions
Based on real-world practice data, this pharmacovigilance
study identified associations between AP and various PI regi­
mens. Indinavir appeared to have a stronger association with
AP than other PIs. Moreover, AP associated with ritonavir
boosted regimens had an earlier onset and occurred as soon
as after the first several doses in some cases. Our findings
provide a foundation for continued surveillance and investiga­
tion into the risk of AP following treatment with PIs, which
could be further evaluated by pharmacoepidemiological
studies.
