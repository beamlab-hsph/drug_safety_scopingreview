Abstract
Objective: The safety profiles of oral fluoropyrimidines were compared with 5-fluorouracil
(5-FU) using adverse event reports (AERs) submitted to the Adverse Event Reporting System,
AERS, of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
Methods: After a revision of arbitrary drug names and the deletion of duplicated submissions,
AERs involving 5-FU and oral fluoropyrimidines were analyzed. Standardized official pharmacovigilance tools were used for the quantitative detection of signals, i.e., drug-associated adverse
events, including the proportional reporting ratio, the reporting odds ratio, the information
component given by a Bayesian confidence propagation neural network, and the empirical Bayes
geometric mean.
Results: Based on 22,017,956 co-occurrences, i.e., drug-adverse event pairs, found in 1,644,220
AERs from 2004 to 2009, it was suggested that leukopenia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia
were more frequently accompanied by the use of 5-FU than capecitabine, whereas diarrhea,
nausea, vomiting, and hand-foot syndrome were more frequently associated with capecitabine.
The total number of co-occurrences was not large enough to compare tegafur, tegafur-uracil
(UFT), tegafur-gimeracil-oteracil potassium (S-1), or doxifluridine to 5-FU.
Conclusion: The results obtained herein were consistent with clinical observations, suggesting
the usefulness of the FDA’s AERS database and data mining methods used, but the number of
co-occurrences is an important factor in signal detection.
Key words: adverse events, AERS, 5-fluorouracil, capecitabine, pharmacovigilance.

Introduction
5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) exerts its anticancer effects
through the inhibition of thymidylate synthase and

incorporation of its metabolites into RNA and DNA,
and has been widely used for the treatment of solid

http://www.medsci.org

tumors for nearly 50 years [1]. In the early 1990s, a
repetitive injection of 5-FU with a biomodulating
agent, leucovorin (LV) was the standard treatment for
metastatic colorectal cancer [2, 3]. However, preclinical evidence that increased exposure to 5-FU improves the cytotoxic activity, and the fact that 5-FU
has a short plasma half-life [4] resulted in the inclusion of continuous infusion in the regimens. Currently, the FOLFIRI or FOLFOX regimen, with or without
a targeted monoclonal antibody, is the standard
treatment, consisting of a bolus of 5-FU, the infusion
of 5-FU/LV, and irinotecan or oxaliplatin, respectively [5-8]. One of the most important factors complicating the clinical use of 5-FU is difficulties for patients, because of the potential for infection, bleeding
and thromboembolism [9, 10], and/or higher treatment costs [11-13], resulting in the development of
oral fluoropyrimidines, e.g., capecitabine, tegafur,
tegafur-uracil (UFT), tegafur-gimeracil-oteracil potassium (S-1), and doxifluridine [14-16].
Immediately after oral fluoropyrimidine development, replacement of the 5-FU/LV infusion with
oral fluoropyrimidines was investigated, especially
for capecitabine; with preferable clinical outcomes,
oral fluoropyrimidines now hold great promise and
they are named the XELIRI or XELOX regimens
[17-21]. The FOLFOX regimen was associated with
neutropenia more than the XELOX regimen, whereas
XELOX was more frequently associated with diarrhea
and hand-foot syndrome (HFS) [17-20]. However, no
conclusions were obtained for adverse events with
relatively low frequencies, including nausea, vomiting, and stomatitis [17-20], and the comparison between the FOLFIRI and XELIRI regimens failed to
clarify a difference in safety profiles, presumably due
to the low number of participants [21]. A recently
published pooled-analysis of randomized trials with a
total of 6571 participants demonstrated that the use of
capecitabine instead of 5-FU resulted in significantly
less toxicity in terms of neutropenia and stomatitis
[22]. In contrast, HFS was more frequently observed
for capecitabine, but the analysis could not elucidate
the effect of the replacement on susceptibility to diarrhea, nausea and vomiting, due to extensive variation in the results of trials used for pooled-analysis
[22].
In this study, the safety profiles of oral fluoropyrimidines were compared with 5-FU using more
than a million case reports on adverse events (AERs)
submitted to the US Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) database. This database relies on reports of
spontaneous adverse events submitted to the FDA
generated by health professionals, consumers, and
manufacturers; the system is referred to as the Ad-

34
verse Event Reporting System (AERS). A statistically
significant association with an adverse event was detected as a signal by applying standardized official
pharmacovigilance methods [23-29]. Here, the adverse events focused on included myelosuppression
(leucopenia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia),
gastrointestinal toxicity (diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting), stomatitis, and HFS.

Methods
Data sources
Input data for this study were taken from the
public release of the FDA’s AERS database, which
covers the period from the first quarter of 2004
through the end of 2009. The data structure of AERS is
in compliance with international safety reporting
guidance ICH E2B, consisting of 7 data sets: patient
demographic
and
administrative
information
(DEMO), drug/biologic information (DRUG), adverse
events (REAC), patient outcomes (OUTC), report
sources (RPSR), drug therapy start and end dates
(THER), and indications for use/diagnosis (INDI).
The adverse events in REAC are coded using preferred terms (PTs) in the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) terminology. Here,
MedDRA ver. 13.0 was used.
Prior to analysis, all drug names were unified
into generic names by a text-mining approach, because AERS permits the registering of arbitrary drug
names, including trade names and abbreviations.
Spelling errors were detected by GNU Aspell and
carefully confirmed by working pharmacists. Foods,
beverages, treatments (e.g. X-ray radiation), and unspecified names (e.g. beta-blockers) were omitted for
this study. Duplicated reports were deleted according
to the FDA's recommendation of adopting the most
recent CASE number, resulting in the reduction of the
number of AERs from 2,231,029 to 1,644,220. The total
number of co-occurrences, i.e., drug-adverse event
pairs, in 1,644,220 AERs was 22,017,956.

Definition of adverse events
According to the MedDRA ver. 13.0, leucopenia,
neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, diarrhea, nausea,
vomiting, stomatitis and HFS are coded as preferred
term identifiers PT10024384, PT10029354, PT10043554,
PT10012735, PT10028813, PT10047700, PT10042128
and PT10033553, respectively.

Data mining
In pharmacovigilance analyses, data mining algorithms have been developed to identify
drug-associated adverse events as signals that are

reported more frequently than expected by estimating
expected reporting frequencies on the basis of information on all drugs and all events in a database
[23-25]. For example, the proportional reporting ratio
(PRR) [26], the reporting odds ratio (ROR) [27], the
information component (IC) [28], and the empirical
Bayes geometric mean (EBGM) [29] are widely used,
and indeed, the PRR is currently used by the UK
Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory
Agency (MHRA), the ROR by the Netherlands Pharmacovigilance Centre, the IC by the World Health
Organization (WHO), and the EBGM by the FDA.
All of these algorithms extract decision rules for
signal detection and/or calculate scores to measure
the associations between drugs and adverse events
from a two-by-two frequency table of counts that involve the presence or absence of a particular drug and
a particular event occurring in case reports. These
algorithms, however, differ from one another in that
the PRR and ROR are frequentist (non-Bayesian),
whereas the IC and EBGM are Bayesian. In this section, only the scoring thresholds used in the present
study are given, and the reader is referred to review
articles for more extensive details of each statistical
test [23-25].
Here, we define how a drug and associated adverse event is classified as a signal, when using each
statistical test. Using the PRR, a signal is detected, if
the count of co-occurrences is 3 or more, and the PRR
is 2 or more with an associated χ2 value of 4 or more
[26]. For the ROR, a signal is detected, if the lower
bound of the 95% two-sided confidence interval of
ROR exceeds 1 [27]. Signal detection using the IC is
done using the IC025 metric, a criterion indicating the
lower bound of the 95% two-sided confidence interval
of the IC, and a signal is detected with the IC025 value
exceeds 0 [28]. Finally, the EB05 metric, a lower
one-sided 95% confidence limit of EBGM [29], is used
and a signal is detected when EB05 is greater than or
equal to the threshold value 2. In this study, the adverse events were extracted when at least 1 of 4 indices met the criteria indicated above.

Results
The total number of co-occurrences with 5-FU
was 40,284, and 34,928 for capecitabine, 320 for
tegafur, 1,215 for UFT, 1,422 for S-1, and 495 for doxifluridine, representing 0.183%, 0.159%, 0.001%,
0.006%, 0.006% and 0.002% of all co-occurrences in the
database, respectively. In total, 864, 802, 110, 227, 246
and 168 adverse events were extracted as 5-FU- or oral
fluoropyrimidine-associated adverse events with
23,690, 20,290, 200, 773, 861 and 305 co-occurrences,
respectively. For each of tegafur, UFT, S-1 and doxi-

35
fluridine, the total number of co-occurrences was not
large enough to compare with 5-FU.
The 5-FU-associated adverse events are listed in
Table 1, which are ranked according to the number of
co-occurrences, and the data for capecitabine is listed
in Table 2. The adverse events commonly found in the
worst 20 included neutropenia, diarrhea, nausea,
vomiting, pyrexia, pulmonary embolism, mucosal
inflammation, asthenia, a decrease of haemoglobin
level, and sepsis.
In Tables 3-6, the data on capecitabine was
compared with 5-FU in terms of susceptibility to
myelosuppression, gastrointestinal toxicity, stomatitis, and HFS, respectively. The statistical metrics suggested 5-FU- and capecitabine-associated leukopenia,
neutropenia and thrombocytopenia, but the association was weaker for capecitabine than 5-FU (Table 3).
The associations with diarrhea, nausea and vomiting
were also suggested for both, but it was more noteworthy for capecitabine than 5-FU (Table 4). The signals were also detected for stomatitis, but there were
no statistical differences between 5-FU and capecitabine (Table 5). The analysis suggested that HFS occurred more extensively for capecitabine (Table 6).

Discussion
The efficacy of each regimen is one of the most
influential factors when the method of cancer chemotherapy is chosen from patients; however, there is
increasing emphasis on assessment of quality of life,
convenience for and preference of the patients. Some
questionnaire-based studies have shown that oral
treatment is more preferred, provided that it is not at
the expense of efficacy [30-32]. Another study suggested that patients prefer the regimen with less toxicity and that it is of minor importance whether the
medication is administrated orally at home or intravenously at a hospital [33]. The AERS database covers
several million case reports on adverse events, and is
characterized by spontaneity. Despite some limitations inherent to spontaneous reporting, the AERS
database is a rich resource and the data mining tools
provide a powerful means of identifying potential
associations between drugs and adverse events.
Pharmacovigilance aims to search for previously unknown patterns and automatically detect important
signals, i.e., drug-associated adverse events, from
such a large database. Recently developed data mining tools, i.e., the PRR, ROR, IC, and EBGM, have
been successful at detecting signals that could not be
found by individual case reviews and that warrant
further investigation together with continuous surveillance [23-29]. These tools are now used routinely
for pharmacovigilance, supporting signal detection
and decision-making at companies, regulatory agencies, and pharmacovigilance centers.

Here, AERs submitted to the FDA’s AERS database were reviewed to compare the safety profiles of
oral fluoropyrimidines with 5-FU, but the total numbers of co-occurrences with tegafur, UFT, S-1 and
doxifluridine were not large enough for comparisons.
Previously, the same database and data mining tools
were used to confirm the adverse events accompanied
with the use of the platinum agents, cisplatin, carboplatin, and oxaliplatin [34]. The analysis suggested
that these agents possibly cause nausea, vomiting,

acute renal failure, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia,
and peripheral sensory neuropathy [34]. In terms of
susceptibility, their rank-order was consistent with
clinical observations, suggesting the usefulness of the
AERS database and the data mining method used
[34]. Additionally, the National Cancer Institute
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events,
NCI-CTCAE, version 4.0 was applied to evaluate the
susceptibility of 14 anticancer agents to hypersensitivity reactions, and it was found that the number of

http://www.medsci.org

Int. J. Med. Sci. 2012, 9
co-occurrences was an important factor in signal detection [35, 36]. Very recently, this system was applied
for evaluation of muscular and renal adverse events
induced by the administration of pravastatin,
simvastatin, atorvastatin, or rosuvastatin, and their
rank-order of susceptibility was quantitatively suggested [37].
Comparison of the FOLFOX regimen with the
XELOX regimen has indicated 5-FU to be more highly
associated with neutropenia compared to capecitabine [17-20]. This was proved by a pooled-analysis of
randomized trials [22], and again confirmed here
(Table 3). In contrast, clinical reports indicated that
HFS was more frequently accompanied by the use of
capecitabine than 5-FU [17-20, 22], and this was also
consistent with the data shown here (Table 6). Although a pooled-analysis failed to clarify their difference in terms of susceptibility to diarrhea [22], the
comparisons of two regimens have shown that diarrhea was more noteworthy for capecitabine [17-20].
This was confirmed in the present study, and additionally, the statistical metrics suggested that capecitabine possibly caused nausea and vomiting more
frequently than 5-FU (Table 4). For stomatitis, a
pooled-analysis suggested that it occurred more frequently with 5-FU than capecitabine, though the present study did not show the same difference (Table 5).
In conclusion, the safety profiles of oral fluoropyrimidines were compared with 5-FU using AERs
submitted to the FDA’s AERS. Based on 22,017,956
co-occurrences found in 1,644,220 AERs from 2004 to
2009, it was suggested that myelosuppression were
more frequently accompanied by the use of 5-FU than
capecitabine, whereas gastrointestinal toxicity and
HFS were more frequently associated with capecitabine. The total number of co-occurrences was not
large enough to be conclusive for tegafur, UFT, S-1
and doxifluridine. The results obtained herein were
consistent with clinical observations, suggesting the
usefulness of the FDA’s AERS database and data
mining methods used, but the number of
co-occurrences is an important factor in signal detection.
