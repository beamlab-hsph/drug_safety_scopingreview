Abstract
Background: Pharmacovigilance programmes monitor and help ensuring the safe use of medicines which is critical to the
success of public health programmes. The commonest method used for discovering previously unknown safety risks is
spontaneous notifications. In this study we examine the use of data mining algorithms to identify signals from adverse
events reported in a phase IIIb/IV clinical trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of several Artemisinin-based combination
therapies (ACTs) for treatment of uncomplicated malaria in African children.
Methods: We used paediatric safety data from a multi-site, multi-country clinical study conducted in seven African countries
(Burkina Faso, Gabon, Nigeria, Rwanda, Uganda, Zambia, and Mozambique). Each site compared three out of four ACTs,
namely amodiaquine-artesunate (ASAQ), dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DHAPQ), artemether-lumefantrine (AL) or
chlorproguanil/dapsone and artesunate (CD+A). We examine two pharmacovigilance signal detection methods, namely
proportional reporting ratio and Bayesian Confidence Propagation Neural Network on the clinical safety dataset.
Results: Among the 4,116 children (6–59 months old) enrolled and followed up for 28 days post treatment, a total of 6,238
adverse events were reported resulting into 346 drug-event combinations. Nine signals were generated both by
proportional reporting ratio and Bayesian Confidence Propagation Neural Network. A review of the manufacturer package
leaflets, an online Multi-Drug Symptom/Interaction Checker (DoubleCheckMD) and further by therapeutic area experts
reduced the number of signals to five. The ranking of some drug-adverse reaction pairs on the basis of their signal index
differed between the two methods.
Conclusions: Our two data mining methods were equally able to generate suspected signals using the pooled safety data
from a phase IIIb/IV clinical trial. This analysis demonstrated the possibility of utilising clinical studies safety data for key
pharmacovigilance activities like signal detection and evaluation. This approach can be applied to complement the
spontaneous reporting systems which are limited by under reporting.

not feasible. The most commonly used data mining methods in
pharmacovigilance include proportional reporting ratio (PRR) [9],
a Bayesian confidence propagation neural network (BCPNN) [10],
and the multi-item gamma Poisson shrinker (MGPS) [11,12]. All
of these are based on a quantitative measure of disproportionality
between observed and expected reports of a certain drug-event
combination when comparing with all other reports of adverse
events and drugs in the dataset. Each of these data mining
methods derives a different statistical measure to qualify the ratio
of observed-to-expected reports, consequently generating a signal
indicative of a safety problem. The PRR has been used on the
European Medicines Agency EudraVigilance database, the
BCPNN by the Uppsala Monitoring Centre on the WHO safety
database, and the MGPS on the database of the Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) [13].
The aim of this study was to examine the feasibility and
usefulness of two DMAs to generate and identify signals exploiting
the safety database of a large multi-country phase IIIb/IV clinical
study.

Background
Historically, there have been several examples of patients being
harmed by prescribed marketed medicines, the thalidomide
tragedy being the paradigmatic case [1]. Today decisions to
prescribe and administer medications are influenced by the
associated risks of adverse drug reactions. Although adult patients
are aware of possible risks of adverse effects related to treatments,
for similarly exposed children, the risk is weighed by a parent or
guardian who can subsequently provide the necessary consent. An
adverse drug reaction (ADR) is defined as any harm associated
with the use of given medications at a normal dosage during
normal use. ADR may occur following a single dose or prolonged
administration of a drug or result from the combination of two or
more drugs [2]. An ADR is different from an adverse event (AE)
which has been defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a
patient or clinical investigation subject to whom a pharmaceutical
product has been administered and which does not necessarily
have a causal relationship with the treatment. An AE can therefore
be any unfavourable and unintended sign (that could include a
clinically significant abnormal laboratory finding), symptom or
disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product,
whether or not considered related to the medicinal product.
Pharmacovigilance has been defined as the process of evaluating
and improving the safety of marketed medicines [3]. The WHO
defines ‘pharmacovigilance’ as ‘‘the science and activities relating
to the detection, assessment, understanding and prevention of
adverse effects or any other drug related problems’’ [4]. Some rare
ADRs are not identified during pre-marketing clinical trials, rather
after the treatment has been marketed and a relatively large
number of patients have been exposed to it. A drug safety signal is
defined as information that arises from one or multiple sources
(including observations and experiments), which suggests a new
potentially causal association, or a new aspect of a known
association, between an intervention and an event or a set of
related events, either adverse or beneficial, that is judged to be of
sufficient likelihood to justify verification [5]. In pharmacovigilance, signal detection refers primarily to the generation and
preliminary assessment of hypotheses suited to explain any
relevant safety observation. Traditionally, such an analysis is
conducted by a systematic manual review of every report sent by
physicians to pharmacovigilance experts.
Post-marketing surveillance analyses are based on ADR
notifications that are voluntarily submitted to the national
pharmacovigilance centres by healthcare providers, industrysponsored phase IV clinical trials, or through prospective clinical
registries [6]. Since the 1960s, this spontaneous reporting system
has been the mainstay for generating drug safety data in some
countries but this practice has only been introduced in Africa in
the last decade [7]. The system relies heavily on the manufacturer,
consumers and healthcare providers to identify and report ADRs,
and therefore may be limited by under reporting [7]. Clinical trials
and other controlled studies usually provide more complete and
homogeneously compiled data which are submitted to the
regulatory authorities and presented in standard formats. Indeed,
all recruited patients comply with specific inclusion and exclusion,
are well described, and are regularly monitored by the research
team to uncover any ADRs. Efficacy and safety analysis are
usually well documented and carefully controlled.
The analytical methods used in post-marketing pharmacovigilance to analyse ADR data and generate suspected ADR signals
include biostatistics and data mining algorithms (DMA) [8]. Data
mining is the technique of extracting hidden associations or
patterns of association in large datasets when manual inspection is

Methods
Data Source
This analysis utilised data from a multi-centric phase IIIb/IV
clinical study that was conducted between July 2007 and July
2009, in twelve sites located in seven African countries (Burkina
Faso, Gabon, Nigeria, Rwanda, Uganda, Zambia, Mozambique)
[14]. Each site compared three of the four artemisinin-based
combination therapies (ACTs) for treatment of uncomplicated
malaria i.e. amodiaquine-artesunate (ASAQ), dihydroartemisininpiperaquine (DHAPQ), artemether-lumefantrine (AL) or chlorproguanil/dapsone and artesunate (CD+A). In each site, one of
the three ACTs was already approved as first line treatment for
uncomplicated malaria and was already being utilised in the
respective populations. Throughout the study period, safety was
assessed through both direct observation using physical exam, vital
signs and laboratory tests by the clinician and the caretaker
reporting an event to the clinic after the patient has been
discharged. Adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events
(SAEs) reports were coded according to the system organ class
(SOC) code, high level term (HLT), preferred term (PT) using the
MedDRA (Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities) [15];
other variables in the safety database included treatment given to
patient, and date of onset of the AE.

Signal Detection
The two methods applied were the proportional reporting ratio
(PRR) [9], and the Bayesian confidence propagation neural
network (BCPNN) [10] – a frequentist and a Bayesian based
framework, respectively. Classically, pharmacovigilance data
mining methods are formulated with contingency table structured
databases [16]. Each spontaneous report may involve several
suspected drugs and several observed events, leading to J (total
number of) drugs and I (total number of) events mentioned at least
once in a report (Table 1).
The suspected AE signals were generated using the R software
[17] by applying PhViD package [18] which is a data mining
package containing several pharmacovigilance signal detection
methods extended to the multiple comparison setting.

Signals Evaluation
We adopted a common pharmacovigilance practice [19,13]
where the clinical validity of the drug-event associations are
identified by the proposed method and reviewed by an expert in

indicated onto the leaflet. Similarly, the signal AL-Pyrexia was
reported by one third of the patients which is slightly more
frequent than in the leaflet (greater than 1 in every 10 patients
treated). After review, two signals, i.e. AL-Malaria and ALPyrexia, were eliminated as they were due to the underlying
disease. The remaining five signals were as follows: i) ‘AL-Eye
discharge’; ii)‘ASAQ-increased Alanine amino Transferase (ALT)’;
iii) ‘ASAQ-Bronchopneumonia’; iv) ‘ASAQ-Neutrophil count
increased’; and v) DHAPQ-‘‘haemorrhagic diarrhoea’’, and
resulted in the new hypotheses that may need further evaluation.
Both DMAs used in this analysis produced similar signals with
similar frequency suggesting they were of comparable performance for this dataset. There was a slight difference in the ranking
done on the lower bound of the confidence interval that takes into
account the variance of the disproportionality measure of
association. Suspected signals ASAQ-Anaemia, ASAQ- increased
Alanine amino Transferase, AL-Malaria and AL-Eye discharge
had the same ranking by both methods (Figure 1) according to the
respective method’s signal index. A drug-event combination like
‘AL-Pyrexia’ had many reports in the database though it did not
translate into higher signal index and was ranked lowest by PRR
though other combinations like ‘AL-eye discharge’ had fewer
reports in the database.

the therapeutic area. The signal detection and evaluation was
done following procedures described elsewhere [20]. Briefly,
signals were evaluated in two stages, first by comparing the
generated signals with the already known drug-events relationship
using the manufacturer package leaflets; secondly, they were
submitted to a clinician with experience on malaria treatments.
The drug manufacturer package leaflets for DHAPQ, AL and
ASAQ were used to eliminate ADRs already mentioned onto the
leaflet. The Multi-Drug Symptom/Interaction Checker software
DoubleCheckMD (http://doublecheckmd.com) – was also used
for AL since it is the only ACT that was found in that database.
The frequency of the generated but known signals was compared
with the frequency already reported on the leaflet to establish
whether this difference deserved further evaluation. The unknown
signals were submitted to four clinicians to identify signals
considered to be rare events deserving further analysis. These
clinicians eliminated events which were most likely due to the
disease and those known to be caused by other concomitant
medications. If two signals were thought to be related, a sensitivity
analysis was done, by removing one of the two and subsequently
rerunning the model. If both signals did not appear again, they
were considered as correlated and thus treated as a single signal,
otherwise they were treated independently. Finally, these signals
were ranked using the signal indices produced by each method.

Discussion
Ethical Considerations and Patients Safety

Each of the two DMAs used a different method of calculating
the signal index and the ranking done on the lower bound of
confidence interval of drug-AE signal indices differed. Both
algorithms produced equal number of signals, suggesting that for
this dataset their performance was comparable.
A drug-event combination like ‘AL-Pyrexia’ had many reports
in the database but did not translate into higher signal index and
hence ranked lower than other combinations with fewer reports
like ‘AL-eye discharge’. This could be due to the fact that similar
AEs occurred among the other drugs of interest. Additionally,
some conditions in the signalled drug-event combinations were
related to each other and therefore removing one combination
affected the appearance of the other as a signal, e.g. ‘bronchopneumonia’ and ‘neutrophil count increased’ (12 reports each); or
malaria with pyrexia.
This paper looks at paediatric pharmacovigilance, an area in
drug safety research that has not gained momentum especially in
the Sub-Saharan African region. This is true for paediatric
pharmacovigilance in both pre-market and post-market phases of
drug evaluation. It is vital to develop effective methods for early
detection of ADRs and drug safety epidemiological studies in
children [21]. In Africa, the need to improve pharmacovigilance
methods applies to both new and existing drugs that have been
used for many years in children. Indeed, the pharmacokinetics of a
given drug may be altered in paediatric patients consequent to

The clinical trial [14] was registered prior to the enrollment of
the first patient in the ClinicalTrials.gov registry (NCT00393679,
http://clinicaltrial.gov/ct2/show/NCT00393679) and in the Pan
African Clinical Trials Registry. (/PACTR2009010000911750,
http://www.pactr.org/). Permission to use the related safety
dataset were obtained from all site investigators of the study team.

Results
A total of 6,238 adverse events were reported within the 28 days
of follow up after taking any of the four ACTs resulting into a total
of 346 drug-AE combinations. The severity or any perceived
relationship with the drug was not taken into account in this
analysis, and multiple events were often reported after treatment
with a drug. From the 346 drug-AE combinations, the two DMAs
generated nine suspected signals which were subjected to review
by the experts (Table 2). Drug-AE combinations involving ASAQ
had more signals (n = 5) than the other ACTs while DHAPQ had
only one.
A third of the generated signals (three out of nine) were already
listed on the manufacturer package leaflets and in the DoubleCheckMD. Comparing the frequency of such reports in our
database with the information in the leaflets, the signal ASAQAnemia was reported for about one in five patients in our database
making it more frequent compared to the one in 100 patients

The signal detection process using phase IIIb/IV clinical studies
data illustrates the potential utility of this approach for future drug
monitoring, especially in Africa where many clinical studies are
conducted and safety data are usually archived after producing the
trial report. Clinical trials databases are usually well designed, of
high quality and high level of completeness for clinical information
and hence are more effective for signal detection. Indeed the use of
spontaneously reported AE data have been associated with a
number of limitations when analysing with the inter-product
quantitative DMA such as underreporting, lack of precision in the
AE definition, uncertainty in estimating the extent of the drug-

intrinsic (e.g. gender, genotype, ethnicity) and/or extrinsic (e.g.
acquired disease states, diet) factors which may occur in the first
two decades of life. Overall, there is limited data available on
safety in children during the drug development process as children
are excluded from most randomized clinical trials. Moreover, in
clinical practice some significant AEs may not be recognised and
documented because paediatric patients cannot communicate
discomfort associated with the drug. Neonates and infants cannot
communicate meaning that the detection of ADRs requires a kin
mother/care taker, paediatrician or a laboratory test.

Signal Detection in a Paediatric Clinical Trial Safety Dataset

The methods used in this analysis worked well in the
identification of single drug-event signals but are not suitable for
the identification of drug interactions since they consider only one
drug at a time. Other methods such as association rules (a priori
algorithms) and clustering algorithms are more appropriate for the
identification of drug interactions. Association rules approach was
used by Harpaz et al [26] using data from FDA spontaneous
adverse events reporting system which demonstrated the opportunity to develop and use novel algorithms to detect drug
interactions.
The signals evaluation method in this analysis was adopted
because there is no structured database of possible ADRs in Africa
other than the VigiBase which is hosted at the WHO safety
monitoring centre in Uppsala [27]. Such a database would
considerably improve the efficiency of signal detection process by
allowing for filtering or flagging reaction reports of previously
unknown reactions. Only five signals remained after the evaluation
process that involved use of manufacturers’ package leaflets, a
Multi-Drug Symptom/Interaction Checker (DoubleCheckMD)
and experts’ opinions. These are regarded as new hypotheses that
may need further studying in pharmacoepidemiological studies.
In conclusion, this paper has demonstrated the possibility of
utilising data mining algorithms with clinical studies safety data for
key pharmacovigilance activities like signal generation and
evaluation especially when datasets from multi-centre clinical
studies are pooled. These methods can be used to facilitate the
initial signal monitoring steps of ‘‘signal strengthening’’, ‘‘signal
follow-up’’ and also for hypothesis generation before the
implementation of epidemiological and experimental studies. This
study also contributes to the limited but important literature on
paediatric pharmacovigilance, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa.

exposed population, unreliability due to the highly variable quality
of the reports [22,23]. Even with such limitations, DMA continue
to be a useful pharmacovigilance tools, utilised by international
organisations and regulatory authorities that possess large spontaneously reported AE databases which routinely generate and
monitor signals.
The use of clinical studies databases would offer an ideal
complement to spontaneous reporting systems (SRS), since such
databases do not suffer the caveats of the SRS and could facilitate
a rapid identification of new signals. Data mining has been used to
explore cardiovascular clinical trials databases [24], and other
specialist databases like the US Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting
System [25]. Clinical trial data have typically not been amenable
to safety data mining techniques because of the small sample sizes
and narrow variations in database designs. However, their high
intrinsic quality and completeness in clinical information make
them invaluable sources of information. On the other hand the
small sample size setback can be averted by pooling of safety
databases from different multi-country, multi-site studies as was
the case for the present study.
Data mining algorithms (DMAs) for quantitative signal detection are practical on large, late stage trials or pooled studies,
though screening for signals ought to begin early in the process.
After identifying safety signals or areas of interest, they can be
tracked over time and lead to further actions. Standardised
documentation provides evidence of continuous proactive vigilance and data can be compared to spontaneous reports and
observational data.
One limitation of DMAs is the potential variation in statistical
properties of the standard signalling threshold when applied to
different datasets. Different thresholds may be needed for more
common versus rare outcomes/events which is not yet currently
done in practice. Another limitation is that a strong association
between an adverse reaction and a drug that is not of specific
interest (e.g. for large values of ‘b’ in Table 1) may reduce the
likelihood of detecting a true signal between that adverse event
and the drug of interest. This situation could occur when a drug
that is an indication for the adverse event of interest is included in
the dataset (and thus included in the ‘all other drugs’ comparison
group).
A specific limitation to the PRR method is the impossibility of
calculating the PRR estimate in the absence of adverse events of
interest reported for the comparison drug (s) (i.e., if b = 0 in
Table 1). Further, since the PRR is a ratio of two proportions, its
value is unstable for small sample sizes as it is the case for most
clinical trials.
