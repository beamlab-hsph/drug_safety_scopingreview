Abstract
Background and Objectives Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) inhibitors are efficacious and considered generally safe
in adults. However, pediatric-specific safety evidence is scarce. The aim of this study was to screen for signals of previously
unknown adverse events of TNF-α inhibitors in pediatric patients.
Methods We conducted a data-mining study based on routinely collected, nationwide Danish healthcare data for 2004–2016.
Using tree-based scan statistics to identify events with unexpectedly high incidence during TNF-α inhibitor use among patients
with inflammatory bowel disease or juvenile idiopathic arthritis, two analyses were performed: comparison with episodes of no
use and with other time periods from the same patient. Based on incident physician-assigned diagnosis codes from outpatient
and inpatient visits in specialist care, we screened thousands of potential adverse events while adjusting for multiple testing.
Results We identified 1310 episodes of new TNF-α inhibitor use that met the eligibility criteria. Two signals of adverse
events of TNF-α inhibitors, as compared with no use, were detected. First, there were excess events of dermatologic complications (ICD-10: L00-L99, 87 vs. 44 events, risk difference [RD] 3.3%), which have been described previously in adults
and children. Second, there were excess events of psychiatric diagnosis adjustment disorders (ICD-10: F432, 33 vs. 7 events,
RD 2.0%), which was likely associated with the underlying disease and its severity, rather than with the treatment. The selfcontrolled analysis generated no signal.
Conclusions No signals of previously unknown adverse events of TNF-α inhibitors in pediatric patients were detected.
The study showed that real-world data and newly developed methods for adverse events data mining can play a particularly
important role in pediatrics where pre-approval drug safety data are scarce.
Key Points
Based on screening of thousands of diagnoses from
nationwide Danish health registers, we identified no
signals of previously unknown adverse events of TNF-α
inhibitors in pediatric patients.
Surveillance of adverse events from routinely collected
real-world data can complement other analyses in generating pediatric-specific drug-safety evidence.

1 Introduction
Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) inhibitors have revolutionized the treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases and
become increasingly common in children [1–3]. Previous
studies in adults have found associations between TNF-α
inhibitors and increased risk of adverse events, including
serious infections and malignancies [4, 5]. However, extrapolation of adult data to children is not necessarily relevant,
as has been shown regarding infections [6]. The pediatricspecific safety evidence for TNF-α inhibitors is generally
scarce.
Detection of potential adverse events post-market
approval is key to ensure safe use of drugs. Signals of previously unknown adverse events can be detected when new
drugs are used at a larger scale and by a wider range of
patients in clinical practice. Adverse event screening can
play a particularly important role in pediatrics, where output

of both clinical and observational studies is low [7, 8]. To
support optimal prescribing in children there is a need for
pediatric-specific safety data [9, 10].
Spontaneous reporting systems have traditionally been
the leading source of timely safety data [11]. However, due
to increasing availability of large amounts of secondary data,
including healthcare registers, new opportunities for signal
generation have emerged [12]. The use of detailed patient
data that are routinely collected over time enables detection
of rare adverse events and decreases the risk of reporting
bias and confounding.
The aim of this data-mining study was to screen for new
signals of adverse events of TNF-α inhibitors in pediatric
patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) or juvenile
idiopathic arthritis (JIA), applying newly developed methods
for adverse events data mining on nationwide Danish health
registers.

2 Method
2.1 Study Population
The study was performed based on Danish populationbased registers, linked via unique personal identity numbers. The source population was defined as all individuals
living in Denmark aged < 18 years at some time during the
study period, 2004–2016. From the source population, we
identified individuals with confirmed pediatric IBD or JIA,
which was defined as at least two contacts with specialist
care (inpatient or outpatient) with a physician-assigned
IBD or JIA diagnosis during the study period or previously
(1986–2016). These made up the study cohort of eligible
individuals. See details in Supplementary Table 1 (Online
Supplementary Material, OSM).

2.2 Exposure Episodes
From the study cohort, we identified episodes of followup of new TNF-α inhibitor use and episodes of no use of
TNF-α inhibitors. New use of TNF-α inhibitors was defined
as initiation of these biologics with no use within 2 years
before. The TNF-α inhibitor episodes continued as long as
the patient was on treatment. Treatment discontinuation was
identified based on assumed duration of each drug administration (Supplementary Table 1, OSM) and an allowed gap
in coverage (grace period) of a maximum of 90 days. Maximum length of follow-up was 3 years (see examples of the
identification of episodes in Supplementary Fig. 1, OSM).
Use of TNF-α inhibitors was defined based on procedure
codes from the Danish National Patient Register (anatomical therapeutic chemical classification system [ATC] code
L04AB). Biologic therapy is only administered in specialist

V. Wintzell et al.

care in Denmark and without incurring any cost for the
patient [13].
Follow-up time with no exposure to TNF-α inhibitors in
the last 2 years was considered no-use time. The no-use time
was divided into episodes of a maximum of 3 years, which
served as comparator episodes. No-use episodes were censored at initiation of TNF-α inhibitors. The episode design
allowed individuals to be included in the study multiple
times, as both TNF-α inhibitor and no-use episodes. All episodes were mutually exclusive; no time nor outcome event
was counted more than once.
We performed two analyses: first, a propensity scorematched analysis where TNF-α inhibitor episodes were
compared with no-use episodes; second, a self-controlled
analysis where temporal risk windows during follow-up
were compared within TNF-α inhibitor initiators.

2.3 Propensity‑Score Matching
In the propensity score-matched analysis, TNF-α inhibitor and no-use episodes were matched on underlying disease (JIA, Crohn’s disease [CD], or ulcerative colitis [UC;
including unclassified IBD]) and on propensity scores. One
patient could contribute multiple episodes to the analysis,
but episodes in each matched pair had to come from different
individuals. General potential confounders were included in
the propensity-score model: demographics (age, sex), socioeconomic factors (family income and education level of
parents), disease duration, drug use in the last year (oral corticosteroids and immunomodulators [thiopurines or methotrexate]), and general healthcare and drug use (number of
prescription drugs, outpatient contacts, and inpatient admissions). We used a nearest-neighbor greedy matching algorithm (1:1 matching) with a caliper corresponding to two
standard deviations of the log-odds of the propensity score
[14]. The caliper was chosen to ensure that all TNF-α inhibitor episodes were matched and included in the analysis.

2.4 Eligibility and Censoring
Episodes were excluded if any of the following criteria were
met at index: age ≥ 18 years, patient lived outside of Denmark in the last 5 years, no specialist-care contact with IBD
or JIA diagnosis in last 3 years, and use of any biologic in
the last year (see Supplementary Table 1, OSM). All patients
were censored at maximum follow-up (3 years), end of study
period (31 December 2016), emigration, or death. TNF-α
inhibitor users were also censored at treatment discontinuation and no-use episodes were censored at initiation of
TNF-α inhibitors, if any. Additionally, within the matched
pairs of the propensity score-matched analysis the episode
with longer follow-up was censored at the end of follow-up
for its match to make follow-up equal within matched pairs.

Data Mining for AEs of TNF-α Inhibitors in Pediatric Patients

2.5 Adverse Events Data Mining
We screened for adverse events based on physician-assigned
diagnosis codes (10th revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems
[ICD-10]) from outpatient and inpatient visits in specialist
care. All ICD-10 codes as well as groups of related codes
at three higher levels were evaluated as potential adverse
events: disease chapters (e.g., I00-99 Diseases of the circulatory system), disease blocks (e.g., I10-15 Hypertensive
diseases), and three- to four-position codes. As such, the
ICD-10 codes define a structured tree of diagnoses and
each grouping is defined by a cut on that tree. Diagnoses
obtained from the register were recorded at the three- and
four-position levels, which also represented individual cuts
(see a detailed example in Supplementary Fig. 2, OSM).
Codes that were not considered relevant as potential adverse
events were excluded from the analysis, for example, congenital conditions, pregnancies and other codings unlikely
to be caused by drugs (see Supplementary Table 2, OSM).
In the propensity score-matched analysis, we screened the
data for cuts with a higher incidence in the TNF-α inhibitor episodes in comparison with the no-use episodes. In the
self-controlled analysis, we screened for temporal clustering
of potential adverse events following initiation of TNF-α
inhibitors, that is, events with higher risk during certain time
windows. Hence only the TNF-α inhibitor episodes were
included in the self-controlled analysis.
Only incident events were considered for the analysis. In
the propensity score-matched analysis, a code was incident
if it was not preceded by the same code at the three-position
level (e.g., I11.0 not preceded by any code starting with I11)
at any time point before index to avoid inclusion of repeated
events within individuals. In the self-controlled analysis, a
look-back of 3 years in relation to the date of each event was
used to determine if it was incident. Hence, the look-back
was constant over follow-up. All events were analyzed but
signals based on fewer than three exposed events could not
be presented due to Danish data protection legislation.

2.6 Tree‑Based Scan Statistics
To identify cuts with a higher incidence we used tree-based
scan statistics, which are disproportionality statistics that
adjust for multiple testing and that allow for simultaneous
testing of diagnosis codes at all levels of granularity, that
is, all cuts on the ICD-10 tree [15]. We screened for potential adverse events in the propensity score-matched analysis
using the unconditional Bernoulli model [16, 17]. Exposure
was assumed to follow a Bernoulli probability distribution.
Under the null hypothesis and given the 1:1 matching ratio,
events in all cuts were equally probable (probability = 0.5)

to occur during TNF-α inhibitor episodes as during no-use
episodes. The alternative hypothesis was that events in at
least one cut had a higher risk (probability > 0.5) of occurring during TNF-α inhibitor episodes.
In the self-controlled analysis, we used the conditional
tree-temporal scan statistic [18, 19]. The analysis was conditioned on the total number of events over follow-up in
each cut. Under the null hypothesis, events were uniformly
distributed over follow-up. The alternative hypothesis was
that there was at least one cut where the risk was higher in
at least one of the analyzed risk windows. An advantage of
this method is that no predefined risk windows are needed;
temporal screening is performed over the entire follow-up
period. We analyzed all unique, temporal risk windows of
2 days–1.5 years that fit during the maximum follow-up of
3 years (maximum window length was half of maximum
follow-up). No window was shorter than 20% of the followup day it ended (e.g., a window that ended on day 100 was
20 days or longer) to avoid analyzing short-risk windows a
long time after drug initiation.
Log likelihood ratios (LLRs) were calculated for each
cut in the propensity score-matched analysis and for each
cut-risk window in the self-controlled analysis. Inference
was based on Monte Carlo simulation because there is no
simple expression for the sample distribution of the LLRs
[20]. p values were obtained for each analysis by ranking
the LLRs of the most likely cuts in relation to maximum
LLRs simulated under the null hypotheses. Cuts with a p
value below 0.05 were considered significant. The analysis
was performed with the free TreeScan v1.4 software (https:​ //
www.trees​can.org) and SAS v9.4 (SAS Institute Inc.).

3 Results
3.1 Episode Characteristics
During the study period, 1310 new users of TNF-α inhibitors were identified. Following 1:1 propensity-score matching, a cohort of 1310 pairs of TNF-α inhibitor episodes
and no-use episodes was included. Episodes were well balanced on all variables, despite the large caliper used in the
matching algorithm (Table 1). Of the TNF-α inhibitor episodes, 59% were female and mean (SD) age was 13.4 (4.0)
years. The indication for TNF-α inhibitor use was JIA in
51% of the episodes, CD in 35%, and UC in 14%. Episodes
were censored at the shortest length of follow-up within
the matched pairs. Mean (SD) length of follow-up was 1.0
(0.9) years. For the self-controlled tree-temporal analysis,
1310 episodes of new TNF-α inhibitor use were included.
The mean (SD) length of follow-up for these episodes was
1.2 (0.9) years.

JIA juvenile idiopathic arthritis

3.2 Propensity Score‑Matched Analysis
In the propensity score-matched cohort, 1284 incident,
unique cuts of the ICD-10 tree were recorded during follow-up among all episodes. There were five cuts with a

significantly high number of events in the TNF-α inhibitor
episodes in comparison with the no-use episodes (Table 2).
Two of the cuts were dermatologic: ICD-10 chapter Diseases of the skin and subcutaneous tissue (L00-99; 87 vs.
44 events; risk difference [RD] 3.3%; p value 0.017) and the

1151

related sub-branch, Dermatitis and eczema (L20-30; 34 vs.
8 events; RD 2.0%; p value 0.004). For context, the excess
number of events in the chapter L00-99 were also driven by
disorders of skin appendages (L60-75; 28 vs. 10 events; p
value 0.39), papulosquamous disorders (L40-45; 10 vs. < 3
events; p value 0.43), and other disorders of the skin and
subcutaneous tissue (L80-99; 13 vs. 10 events; p value 1.00)
(Supplementary Table 3, OSM). The other three significant
cuts were ICD-10 block Anxiety, dissociative, stress-related,
somatoform, and other nonpsychotic mental disorders (F4048; 39 vs. 11 events; RD 2.1%; p value 0.007), Reaction to
severe stress and adjustment disorders (F43; 35 vs. 9 events;
RD 2.0%; p value 0.008), and Adjustment disorders (F432;
33 vs. 7 events; RD 2.0%; p value 0.002) (Table 2 and Supplementary Table 3, OSM).

3.3 Self‑Controlled Analysis
The self-controlled analysis was performed on the TNF-α
inhibitor episodes. In total, 1036 unique cuts with incident
events during these episodes were identified. No combinations of cuts and risk windows with significantly high incidence were identified. Hence, there were no signals of events
with temporal clustering during follow-up.

4 Discussion
In this data-mining study of adverse events of TNF-α inhibitors in pediatric patients based on the nationwide Danish
population, we found no signals of previously unknown
adverse events. A signal of dermatologic complications
that has been previously described in adults and children
was detected, including excess cases of diseases of the
skin and subcutaneous tissue, and dermatitis and eczema
[21–26]. A detected signal of psychiatric diagnoses of
anxiety, dissociative, stress-related, somatoform, and other
nonpsychotic mental disorders, including reaction to severe
stress and adjustment disorders, was likely associated with

the underlying disease and its severity, rather than with the
treatment. The study shows the utility and advantages of
newly developed methods for adverse event data mining to
generate safety information that is specific to children based
on Scandinavian health registers.
Previous studies have described dermatologic adverse
events of TNF-α inhibitor use. In particular, studies have
described that new-onset psoriasis is a paradoxical adverse
event of TNF-α inhibitors in patients with rheumatic disease and IBD. In adult IBD, dermatologic events have been
recorded in 21–29% (sample size n = 583–732) of patients
initiating TNF-α inhibitors, where median follow-up was
3–4.4 years [21, 22]. Psoriasis and cutaneous infections
were the most common manifestations. In pediatric patients,
one study found the risk of dermatologic events to be 11%
(n = 409), with psoriasis, infections, and eczema being the
most common diagnoses [23]. A small pediatric case series
estimated the risk at 48% (n = 84), where half of the patients
with events had lesions that were considered severe [26].
The risk of new-onset psoriasis among pediatric TNF-α
inhibitor users has been estimated at 8–14% (n = 73–409)
[23–25]. In our analysis, 6.6% of TNF-α inhibitor episodes
had at least one incident event in the chapter Diseases of the
skin and subcutaneous tissue (L00-99) and the risk difference in comparison with no use was 3.3%.
The previous pediatric studies are one-arm case series or
cohort studies that do not estimate the risk in relation to nontreated patients, that is, the relative risk or risk difference.
To inform clinical practice about the potential dermatologic
risks in pediatric patients, pharmacoepidemiologic studies in
large, unselected populations with suitable comparators are
needed, since clinical trials of suitable power will unlikely
be conducted.
Our analysis also generated a signal of adjustment disorders (F432), which is part of reaction to severe stress and
adjustment disorders (F43), and the ICD-10 block Anxiety,
dissociative, stress-related, somatoform and other nonpsychotic mental disorders (F40-48). A plausible interpretation
is that the signal reflects an association with the burden of

underlying severe disease in general, rather than the pharmacologic effect of TNF-α inhibitors. A recent study showed
that the risk of related conditions is higher in pediatric IBD
patients in comparison with the general population: hazard
ratios were 1.6 for mood disorders (427 events) and 1.5 for
anxiety disorders (673 events), although the study did not
investigate whether disease severity is a risk factor [27].
Key strengths of this study were the generalizability and
large sample of pediatric patients analyzed through routinely
collected healthcare data on non-selected TNF-α inhibitor
initiators from the national Danish population. Patients were
identified during a study period of 13 years and followed for
1 year on average. The data sources were also granular and
comprehensive enough to allow for robust confounding control and to identify a large range of potential adverse events.
However, null findings in this type of hypothesis-generating
study cannot be interpreted as an absence of adverse events.
Insufficient power or too scattered recording of certain diagnoses can lead to non-significant clusters.
Our use of the recently developed tree-based scan statistics enabled scanning for clusters of events at multiple levels
of diagnosis granularity, for temporal clustering in relationship to drug initiation, and simultaneously adjust for multiple testing to generate valid p-values. The self-controlled
and propensity score-matched analyses complemented each
other. By performing both, we were able to capture signals of
potential adverse events based on both temporally increased
incidence and generally increased incidence in comparison
with matched, no-use episodes. The lack of a priori defined
potential adverse events and potential risk windows were
strengths of the analysis.
A potential limitation was residual confounding. The
propensity score-matched analysis was susceptible to confounding by indication and the self-controlled analysis to
time-dependent confounding within TNF-α inhibitor users.
In the propensity score-matched analysis, we adjusted for the
general potential risk factors age, sex, underlying disease,
disease duration, treatment history, and general healthcare
and drug use. Given that disease severity, which is generally higher in TNF-α inhibitor users, is positively associated with the risk of many potential adverse events, it was
unlikely that residual confounding by indication resulted in
false negatives.
We chose not to use alternative study designs that might
have decreased confounding additionally, including active
comparator new user and prevalent new user designs [28,
29], due to the large exclusion of TNF-α inhibitor users
and reduced power that these designs would have required.
Given the hypothesis-generating aim of the study, we prioritized analyzing all TNF-α inhibitor initiators during the
study period. As for all adverse event data-mining studies,
we analyzed a large set of potential outcomes simultaneously

and we did not adjust for specific risk factors in relation to
each outcome. The included factors represent key confounders in relation to most types of outcomes—as themselves
or as proxies for other factors. The aim of the analysis was
to detect signals of potential adverse events, rather than
inferring causality between drug and outcomes. Nonetheless, robust confounding control increases the validity of
the results.
Another potential limitation of the study was misclassification of exposure or outcomes, which can lead to biased
results. All TNF-α inhibitor treatment is administered in specialist care in Denmark, and coverage in the national patient
register is considered to be high [13, 30]. A previous study
has validated the use of diagnosis codes from the Danish
national patient register to detect outcomes [31]. We did not
have access to general practice records, which meant that
adverse events only diagnosed in the primary-care setting
could not be detected in the analysis. However, children with
serious and chronic disease, such as IBD and JIA, are cared
for almost exclusively in specialist care.

5 Conclusions
This adverse event-screening study identified no previously
unknown adverse events of TNF-α inhibitors in pediatric
patients. The study also showed how newly developed methods for health-register screening can provide comprehensive and relevant adverse event signal detection. In pediatric patient groups where data are scarce, this approach can
complement other types of studies in generating drug-safety
evidence.

Declarations
Funding Open access funding provided by Karolinska Institute.
This study was supported by the Swedish Research Council (201601974), Frimurare Barnhuset Foundation, and the Karolinska Institutet
Research Foundation. Pasternak was supported by an investigator grant
from the Strategic Research Area Epidemiology program at Karolinska
Institutet. The funders had no role in the design and conduct of the
study; collection, management, analysis, and interpretation of the data;
preparation, review, or approval of the manuscript; or the decision to
submit the manuscript for publication.
Conflict of interest J.F. Ludvigsson coordinates a study on behalf of
the Swedish IBD quality register (SWIBREG) outside the submitted
work. That study has received funding from Janssen corporation. H.
Svanström reports consulting fees from Celgene and employment at
IQVIA outside the submitted work. V. Wintzell, M. Melbye, B. Pasternak, and M. Kulldorff have no conflicts of interest to declare.
Ethics approval No approval was needed because this was a registerbased study.
Informed consent Not required because the analysis was based on
secondary register data.
