Data mining is critical for signal detection in pharmacovigilance systems. In this study, we compared signals between spontaneous reporting data and health insurance claims data for a socially issued drug,
methylphenidate. We implemented data-mining tools for signal detection in both databases: Reporting
Odds Ratios (ROR), Proportional Reporting Ratios (PRR), Chi-squared test, and Information Component
(IC), in addition to a Relative Risk (RR) tool in the claims database. The claims database generated 15,
15, 36, 1, and 1 adverse drug reactions (ADRs) by ROR, PRR, chi-square, IC, and RR, respectively. The
World Health Organization (WHO) spontaneous database generated 91, 91, 137, and 96 ADRs by ROR,
PRR, chi-square, and IC, respectively. We found seven potential matching associations from the claims
and WHO databases, but only one of them was present in the Korean spontaneous reporting database.
In Korea, spontaneous reporting is still underreported and there is a small amount of data for Koreans.
Signal comparison between the claims and WHO databases can provide additional regulatory insight.

1. Introduction
The information available regarding the potential adverse drug
reactions (ADRs) to a drug at the time of approval are limited (van
Puijenbroek et al., 2003). In fact, any 2000-person study has an 18%
chance to detect ADRs that occur at a 0.01% rate (Shin, 2006).
Therefore, continuous systematic surveillance for unexpected
ADRs (van Puijenbroek et al., 2003) is an important part of pharmacovigilance, which is deﬁned as the science of and activities relating to the detection, assessment, understanding, and prevention of
adverse effects or any other possible drug-related problems (WHO,
2002).
The pharmacovigilance system of the Korea Food and Drug
Administration (KFDA) involves three regulations under the pharmaceutical affairs law to maintain public health. Two of those
three regulations, the re-examination of new drugs (KFDA, 2009)
and the re-evaluation of drugs (KFDA, 2008b), are mandatory
regulations. The last regulation, spontaneous ADR monitoring to

identify safety signals, is only mandatory for pharmaceutical companies and pharmacists, not for physicians (KFDA, 2008a). Signals
are deﬁned as reported information on a possible causal relationship between an adverse event and a drug, the relationship being
unknown or incompletely documented previously (WHO, 2002).
Such a signal usually requires more than a single report, depending
on the seriousness of the event and the quality of the information
(WHO, 2002). KFDA set up a Spontaneous Reporting System (SRS)
in 1988 and has been collecting data continuously since then.
Several measures can be applied to quantify ADR disproportionally to a certain drug compared to other drugs in the SRS database
worldwide, such as the Proportional Reporting Ratio (PRR), the
Reporting Odds Ratio (ROR), chi-squared test (v2), and Bayesian
Conﬁdence Propagation Neural Network (BCPNN) (Li et al., 2008).
There is no gold standard of universal thresholds for statistical
signals.
Attention-Deﬁcit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a highly
prevalent disorder worldwide, estimated to affect 5–10% of children (Lee et al., 2007). In Korea, ADHD treatments are viewed as
‘‘good grade medicine’’ for school-age students, leading to inappropriate use by parents and students. These drugs also have potential
risks of cardiovascular and psychiatric symptoms, as outlined by

155

medication guides approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (USFDA, 2007).
Therefore, we tested for signals of the socially issued drug,
methylphenidate, in spontaneous reporting and claims databases
to determine whether comparing signals from different databases
is a reasonable method for ﬁnding signals in Korea.
2. Method
2.1. Spontaneous reporting data signal detection
2.1.1. Korean data source
Since 1988, the KFDA has been collecting spontaneous reports
of adverse events from pharmaceutical companies, healthcare professionals, patients, and consumers. The data contains patient initials, age, gender, adverse reaction term, and suspected drugs. The
adverse drug reaction is coded by WHO Adverse Reaction Terminology (WHO-ART), and we use the preferred terminology of
WHO-ART for analysis. From 1988 to 2007, there were 11,144 reports and 14,801 drug-adverse reaction combinations (Table 1).
2.1.2. World Health Organization (WHO)-Uppsala Monitoring Center
(UMC) database
Since 1968, the UMC in Sweden has collected reports of ADRs
from the WHO collaborating centers for international drug surveillance in 96 countries. The database contains over 4.9 million case
reports (WHO-UMC, 2010). All ADRs listed in the WHO/UMC database are based on WHO-ART preferred terms (Sanchez-Matienzo
et al., 2006). The national center can access the WHO database,
as can the KFDA. The data we used in this study was extracted from
an updated version in Feb 25, 2010, by searching for the active
ingredient ‘‘Methylphenidate’’.
2.2. Health claims data signal detection
2.2.1. Data source
We used the Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service
(HIRA) data. Korea has a national health insurance system that covers 50 million Koreans. The HIRA data includes all medical records
that are supplied by health professionals. HIRA collects data from
healthcare professionals who have to submit their medical records
with patient information, disease codes, drug codes, and diagnosis
to determine their performance costs. The HIRA database also contains all claims data for clinic and pharmacy visits with prescriptions (Choi et al., 2010). We requested the HIRA claims data for
children (age 6–18) who visited the clinic from 1 January, 2003,
to 31 December, 2007. We selected children with an ADHD diagnosis by the International Classiﬁcation of Diseases and Related
Health Problems, tenth revision (ICD-10).
According to the law on the Protection of Personal Information
Maintained by Public Agencies, HIRA masks individual identity
codes with a random number but keeps all information in the record together. Such data includes the date of visit, age, gender,
main diagnosis, and prescribed drugs. Drug information includes
the trade name code, generic name code, dosage, and duration.

ance if the patient is diagnosed with ADHD between the ages 6 and
18 (HIRA, 2005). Beyond those ages, the health professional does
not need to claim the clinic visit because there will be no reimbursement; thus inclusion of other ages could lead to inaccurate
data. Moreover, we only include children because most ADHD
occurs in childhood and this population is excluded from clinical
trials. Methylphenidate, pemoline, modaﬁnil, atomoxetine,
bupropion, clonidine, and ﬂuoxetine are a choice of ADHD treatment (Gau et al., 2008). Atomoxetine is a newly marketed drug
in Korea and also it is not covered by HIRA, so it is not included
in the study population.
2.3. Deﬁnition of drug exposure and drug-ADR combination
We used methylphenidate, the most common ADHD treatment,
as the target drug and other ADHD treatments as reference drugs.
Drug exposure refers to the date the patient received the target or
reference drug. Estimated ADRs are deﬁned as a clinic visit within
12 weeks of the prescribed date of the target or reference drug.
Estimated ADRs are identiﬁed by ICD-10 diagnosis unless it is the
patient’s ﬁrst visit (Choi et al., 2010). The 12-week time window
was selected based on the methodology of previous studies
(Alsheikh-Ali et al., 2005).
2.4. Signal detection
We used 5 statistical methods to generate the signals. All signal
detection was generated by a 2  2 contingency (Table 2). The statistics were calculated with the background frequency of drug and
suspected ADRs. Signals were deﬁned as more than one case
(KFDA, 2008a; WHO, 2002). In addition, we calculated the sensitivity, speciﬁcity, PPV, and NPV by dividing the total number of signals coincident with labeled AEs by the total number of detected
signals. The statistics were calculated using SAS 9.1 software.
2.4.1. Reporting Odds Ratios (ROR)
ROR is deﬁned as the product of the exposure odds among the
cases with respect to the exposure odds among the non-cases
(van Puijenbroek et al., 2003; van Puijenbroek et al., 2002).

ROR ¼

A Drug-ADR combination is deﬁned as a signal when the lower
limit of ROR’s 95% conﬁdence interval is greater than 1 and there is
more than one case.
2.4.2. Proportional Reporting Ratios (PRR)
PRR is analogous to proportional mortality ratios in epidemiology and is based on the observation that the proportional frequency of individual adverse reactions reported is relatively

The drug-ADR combination is deﬁned as a signal when the lower limit of PRR’s 95% conﬁdence interval is greater than 1 and there
is more than one case.

2.4.5. Risk Ratio (RR)
The estimated RR is calculated from the equation below. RR is
only available if a denominator is known. It is possible to calculate
total prescription number from the HIRA data, so the total prescription numbers were calculated for the denominator. For the calculation, methylphenidate-suspected AE number (N1), the total number
of methylphenidate prescriptions (T1), other ADHD treatmentSuspected AE number (N0), and total number of other ADHD treatment prescriptions (T0) are used (Choi et al., 2010; Rothman, 2002).

RR ¼ ðN1=T1Þ=ðN0=T0Þ
2.4.3. Chi-squared test ðv2 Þ
The Chi-squared test compares each cell by observed frequency
with an expected frequency to assess the association. The drugADR combination is deﬁned as a signal of the drug when the value
of v2 is greater than 3.84 (95th percentile of v2 distribution with 1
degree of freedom) and there is more than one case.

2.4.4. Information Component (IC)
IC uses Bayesian inference applied to the value, precision, and
time trend of the information component as the basis for signal
detection. Since 1998, the UMC has used IC to detect signals (Bate
et al., 1998; Hauben and Zhou, 2003). The drug-ADR combination is
deﬁned as a signal of the drug when the lower limit of IC’s 95%
credibility interval is greater than 0 and there is more than one

2.5. Comparing SRS with claims database
If a drug-ADR combination is reported more than once (WHO,
2002) and detected by 2 indices in one data source, that ADR is regarded as a signal. We compared the signals generated from separate data sources. We matched the ICD-10 code with WHO-ART
code to compare signal indices. We deﬁned a signal as generated
by separate data sources from two different measures and compared signals with the current methylphenidate label on ﬁle with
KFDA to identify unexpected signals. Here, we used a label updated
on 14 July, 2008 (Table 3). Pharmacists independently compared
the detected signals with the label adverse event (AE) list. When
experts evaluate the detected signal, they are offered only the
ADR lists (WHO-ART from SRS, ICD-10 from claims data) and the
label list without the classiﬁcation information about ADRs. All
suspected signals are reviewed to determine if signals are labeled
or not. For example, if headache is detected as a signal, it would
be labeled if headache is listed on the product information. Finally,
we matched the ICD-10 code with WHO-ART to compare signals to
detect Korean-speciﬁc ADRs.
3. Results
Methylphenidate was reported in 97 cases, with 46 kinds of
ADR reported to KFDA; 19 of them were reported in more than
a single case. ROR, PRR, chi-square, and IC detected 11, 11, 14,
and 7 ADRs, respectively. ROR and PRR detected the same ADRs

as signals. Most of them were labeled in the product information,
with only two unlabeled from the chi-squared test. All ADRs detected by IC were labeled in product information (data not
shown).
The HIRA database contained records of 38,523 children diagnosed with ADHD. A total of 375,027 prescriptions were claimed
to HIRA, with 327 suspected ADRs and 196 ADRs reported more
than once. The most common ADR (n = 1921) was a depressive episode. The number of signals by ROR, PRR, chi-square, IC, and RR
were 15, 15, 36, 1, and 1 ADRs, respectively. ROR and PRR detected
the same ADRs as signals: 8 were labeled in the product information and 7 were unlabeled. In the chi-squared test, 16 were labeled
in the product information and 20 were unlabeled. IC and RR
detected only 1 different signal. The signal derived from IC was

labeled but the signal from RR was unlabeled (Table 4). For the
claims database, the sensitivity, speciﬁcity, PPV, and NPV were
0–0.174, 0.953–1.000, 0–1.000, and 0.764–0.790, respectively.
In the WHO-UMC database, about 7700 adverse events were reported for methylphenidate, with 899 kinds of ADRs; 218 of these
matched the Korean results (including spontaneous reports and
claims data). The most frequently reported ADR was a decrease
in therapeutic response, with 464 events, and 199 ADRs were reported more than once. The number of signals by ROR, PRR, chisquare, and IC were 91, 91, 137, and 96 ADRs, respectively. As in
the HIRA database, ROR and PRR detected the same ADRs as signals: 43 were labeled and 48 were unlabeled. In the chi-squared
test, 59 were labeled and 78 were unlabeled. Among from IC values, 43 were labeled and 53 were unlabeled (Table 5). For the

WHO database, the sensitivity, speciﬁcity, PPV, and NPV were
0.589, 0.584–0.616, 0.453–0.473, and 0.709–0.719, respectively.
ADRs (n = 218) that were Korean-speciﬁc were obtained by
matching spontaneous reports and claims data. We found 7 signals
that matched within the HIRA and WHO-UMC databases, but only
1 of the detected signals was reported in the Korean SRS database
(Table 6).
4. Discussion
A pharmacovigilance system with SRS is important for ﬁnding
drug-ADR associations. Signal detection allows extrapolation beyond single cases to the population, thus prioritizing events for
monitoring and regulatory efforts are important. Here, we analyzed and compared the SRS and claims data to detect signals by
comparing disproportionality measures, rather than by the j statistic or sensitivity, speciﬁcity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value, as has been done in other studies (Li et al.,
2008; van Puijenbroek et al., 2002). Our goal was not to ﬁnd the
best index among the ﬁve for signal detection, but rather to choose
Korean-speciﬁc ADRs by comparing ADRs from other data sources.
We compared ADRs from the indices of different databases in order
to detect drug safety signals. We found 7 potential associations, 3

of which were unlabeled. One of these was only detected in the
Korean Spontaneous Reporting System, because of data size, and
it was already labeled in the product information. This method is
very useful in Korea, in which adverse reaction reports are relatively low compared to those in other countries. We can use this
method to determine Korean-speciﬁc adverse reactions on which
the regulatory agency should focus.
We found many signals in the WHO database and HIRA database. However, most WHO data (80%) is from USA, UK, Germany,
Canada, France, Australia, Spain, Sweden, and the Netherlands,
viz. mostly Caucasians (WHO-UMC, 2010), and may not apply to
Asians. So, comparing the databases could be a good method for
determining Korean-speciﬁc adverse drug reactions. In Korea, a
diagnostic code is required for national health insurance claims,
and healthcare professionals must ﬁle a claim in HIRA, which is
the nationwide health care system. These codes are stored in the
HIRA database to correlate diagnosis, medical intervention, and
prescriptions to determine reimbursement levels. Thus, the HIRA
database contains appropriate information for signal detection.
These results have some limitations. First, Korean SRS data are
only available until 2007. Korean spontaneous reporting has increased geometrically: 7210 and 26,827 cases in 2008 and 2009,
respectively. KFDA experts are now reviewing the data from

2008 and beyond. Therefore, we could only use spontaneous data
collected by 2007. Second, we compared the ADRs of methylphenidate with those of other ADHD treatments in the claims database,
but with all other drugs in the WHO database. In this study, we
compared the statistics of data obtained by other sources. In the
HIRA database, it was difﬁcult to compare methylphenidate with
all the data because of the large amount of data; we therefore used
prescription records for the same class (Sanchez-Matienzo et al.,
2006). On the other hand, the WHO database offers the total number of ADR reports, so we compared the selected data with all the
other data, not only that reported for ADHD class drugs. This could
be appropriate because the statistics are calculated by proportionality. Thus, the statistics are calculated with ‘‘c’’ and ‘‘d’’ (see Table
2), and ‘‘c’’ (all other drugs with suspected ADRs) and ‘‘d’’ (all other
drugs with all other ADRs) go up or down together by reporting of
drugs. The ratio of ‘‘a’’: ‘‘b’’ and ‘‘c’’: ‘‘d’’ is therefore to be same. Disproportionality is calculated by the rate of ‘‘a’’: ‘‘b’’ compared to
‘‘c’’: ‘‘d’’. Thus, calculating a different set of ‘‘all others’’ may not affect the results of proportionality. The indices used for signal calculation by disproportionality are well-known (Lindquist et al., 2000;
Sanchez-Matienzo et al., 2006) and we sought to identify potential
signals, not to determine their magnitude. Third, some diagnostic
terminology cannot be matched with adverse drug reaction terminology because some diagnostic terminology is not drug-related
such as post-surgical states, complications of procedures, toxic effects of metals, and social problems. Such codes cannot be matched
with adverse reaction terms, but these codes are very rare,
although they can cause data loss. Fourth, the claims data from
healthcare professionals has uncertainty. Only 21.6% of diagnoses
in the HIRA database were equivalent to actual diagnoses (Park
et al., 2003). Fifth, some ICD-10 code terms were hard to match
to WHO-ART. Matching the ICD-10 code and WHO-ART is somewhat subjective since there is no standard matching for adverse
event codes and ICD-10 codes. We had two pharmacists independently match the codes. Because the Korean database is too small
to detect signals, we recommend using a mix of WHO and HIRA
data to detect safety concerns.
A part of risk management is to determine the direction of public health policy. Conservative decisions can made by statistical
measures over a given threshold, which can generate many drugADR combinations. At the same time, multiple drug-ADR combinations are difﬁcult to identify and regulate appropriately. Signal
detection can help prioritize health policy concerns at the government level, particularly as Koreans are concerned about ethnicspeciﬁc ADRs, given their genetic differences (Tuan and Nicklas,
2009; Zhang et al., 2009). Therefore, the national database is
important for detecting ADRs that are related to public health
safety.
5. Conclusions
We compared signals generated by different data sources. In
Korea, the spontaneous reporting rate and amount of data are relatively low, so ethnic-speciﬁc signals are barely detected. Signal
comparison with spontaneous and claims database can be a complementary method for generating such signals and can provide
basic data for implementing appropriate regulatory control.
