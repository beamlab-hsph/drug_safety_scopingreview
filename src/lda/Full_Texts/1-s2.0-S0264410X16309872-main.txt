13-Valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine
(PCV13)

a b s t r a c t
Background: The 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) was first recommended for use in
adults aged P19 years with immunocompromising conditions in June 2012. On August 2014, the
Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommended routine use of PCV13 among adults
aged P65 years.
Methods: We assessed adverse events (AEs) reports following PCV13 in adults aged P19 years reported
to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) from June 2012 to December 2015. VAERS is a
national spontaneous reporting system for monitoring AEs following vaccination. Our assessment
included automated data analysis, clinical review of all serious reports and reports of special interest.
We conducted empirical Bayesian data mining to assess for disproportionate reporting.
Results: VAERS received 2976 US PCV13 adult reports; 2103 (71%) of these reports were from PCV13
administered alone. Fourteen percent were in persons aged 19–64 years and 86% were in persons aged
P65 years. Injection site erythema (28%), injection site pain (24%) and fever (22%) were the most frequent AEs among persons aged 19–64 years; injection site erythema (30%), erythema (20%) and injection
site swelling (18%) were the most frequent among persons aged P65 years who were given the vaccine
alone. The most frequently reported AEs among non-death serious reports were injection site reactions
and general malaise among persons 19–64 years old; injection site reactions, general malaise and
Guillain-Barré syndrome among those P65 years (Table 2). Data mining did not detect disproportional
reporting for any unexpected AE.
Conclusions: The results of this study were consistent with safety data from pre-licensure studies of
PCV13. We did not detect any new or unexpected AEs.

1. Introduction
On February 2010 the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
approved 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13, Prevnar 13Ò, Pfizer, Inc.) for infants and children to age 5, to prevent
pneumonia and invasive disease caused by S. pneumonia serotypes
contained in the vaccine [1]. On December 30, 2011, it was
approved for use in adults aged P50 years and various age groups,
including children from age 6 and older [2]. On June 20, 2012, the

Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommended routine use of PCV13 in series with 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23, Pneumovax23Ò, Merck & Co.,
Inc.) for adults aged P19 years with immunocompromising conditions, functional or anatomic asplenia, cochlear implants, or cerebrospinal fluid leaks [3,4]. On August 13, 2014, ACIP
recommended expanded routine use of PCV13 one or more year
apart with PPSV23 (bases on phase 3 clinical trials) among adults
aged P65 years [4,5].
The safety of PCV13 was evaluated in approximately 6000
PPSV23-naïve and PPSV23-experienced adults aged P50 years
[6]. Phase 3 clinical trials in adults aged P70 years revealed lower

P. Haber et al. / Vaccine 34 (2016) 6330–6334

frequencies of adverse events (AEs) in both groups when PCV13
followed by PPSV23 were given compared to PPSV23 followed by
PCV13 [6,7]. Local reactions occurred more often when subjects
received two doses of PPSV23 than when subjects received a dose
of PPSV23 given after a dose of PCV13. When comparing PCV13
and PPSV23, there was no difference in the overall incidence of
serious AEs reported within one month of an initial study dose.
For PCV13, the most commonly reported AEs were fatigue, pain,
redness, and swelling at the injection site [4]. In a recent postmarketing safety study of PCV13 in Italy, adults aged P50 years
had overall lower rates of the most common systemic reactions
compared to the pre-licensure clinical safety studies [1,6–8].
The study was designed to assess the safety profile of PCV13
since the initial recommendation for adult’s usage over the first
three and a half years of usage, June 2012 through December
2015. The study assessed the safety profile by age-group and any
unexpected AEs in adults who received PCV13, including AEs
resulting from possible PCV13 administration errors such as inappropriate schedule (e.g. wrong drug administered to patient of
inappropriate age).

2. Methods
2.1. Data source
Our study assessed vaccine adverse event reports following
PCV13 in adults aged P19 years reported to the Vaccine Adverse
Event Reporting System (VAERS) from June 2012 to December
2015. VAERS is a national vaccine safety surveillance program
run by CDC and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). This early
warning system is designed to detect possible safety issues with U.
S.-licensed vaccines [9,10]. Anyone can submit a report to VAERS,
including doctors, nurses, vaccine manufacturers and the general
public. VAERS data contain information on demographics of the
person vaccinated, vaccine type, and AE. Signs and symptoms of
AEs, as well as physician diagnoses (when reported) are coded
using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities [11], a clinically validated, internationally standardized medical terminology.
A VAERS report may be assigned one or more MedDRA preferred
terms (PT). A PT is a distinct descriptor for a symptom, sign, disease, diagnosis, therapeutic indication, investigation, surgical, or
medical procedure, and medical, social, or family history characteristic [12]. Based on the Code of Federal Regulations, a report is considered serious if it includes one or more of the following: death,
life-threatening illness, hospitalization or prolongation of existing
hospitalization, or permanent disability [13]. A report to VAERS
does not mean a vaccine caused an AE only that an AE occurred
after a vaccine was given.

2.3. Clinical review
CDC physicians (JA and MC) performed a clinical review of serious reports and associated available medical records for the following categories, which were not mutually exclusive: (1) prespecified conditions based on previous studies or clinical judgment, such as anaphylaxis [14,15] and Guillain-Barré Syndrome
(GBS) [16–21]. To identify the anaphylaxis reports we searched
for reports indicating one or more of the following MedDRA terms:
anaphylactic shock, anaphylactic reaction, anaphylactoid reaction,
and anaphylactoid shock. To identify the GBS reports we searched
for reports indicating one or more of the following MedDRA terms:
Guillain Barre Syndrome, Miller Fisher Syndrome, and Demyelinating Polyneuropathy; (2) reports indicating that PCV13 was given
within a short time interval since PPSV23 administration, e.g.,
PCV13 and PPSV23 on the same visit, or either PPSV23 or PCV13
within 4 weeks prior to PCV13 as noted on the VAERS questionnaire in box 14 ‘‘any other vaccinations within 4 weeks prior to
date of vaccination?” [10]. In order to identify additional possible
PCV13 vaccination errors, we searched for the following MedDRA
PTs: ‘‘inappropriate schedule of drug administration” and/or ‘‘extra
dose”.
Physicians reviewed all serious reports and available medical
records, including laboratory reports, death certificates (when
available) and autopsy reports.
Physicians first determined the primary event (or the event
which appeared to trigger the report to VAERS), then assigned each
case a primary diagnostic category using System Organ Class in
MedDRA [11].
The Brighton Collaboration case definition was applied to verify
the diagnosis for all reports suggestive of GBS or anaphylaxis, and
present the information in a consistent and standardized manner
[14,18].
We did not assess causality between a vaccine and an AE or
whether a vaccination error contributed to an AE.
2.4. Disproportionality analysis (data mining)
We applied empirical Bayesian data mining methods to identify disproportionality [22,23] of vaccine-adverse event pairs and
stratified by age group, sex, and by the year the reports was
received. We used published criteria [23] to identify AEs that
were reported more often than was expected after PCV13 vaccine was given (i.e., lower bound of the 90% confidence interval
surrounding the EB geometric mean, EB05 > 2). We reviewed
reports and available medical records for AEs that met the
EB05 criterion.

3.1. Descriptive analysis

2.2. Descriptive analysis
Since PCV13 is recommended for all PCV13 naïve adults
P65 years of age and for adults aged P19 years with certain
underlying chronic medical conditions, we performed the analysis
into two age groups: 19–64 years and P65 years. We excluded foreign reports and reports with unknown ages.
Our descriptive statistics analysis included mean and median
age of vaccinated individuals, onset interval (from vaccination date
[day 0] to onset of first symptoms), and frequency of the most common MedDRA Preferred Term level (PTs) (coding term to describe a
single AE) by age group following PCV13 given alone or concomitantly with other vaccines. We used SAS (version 9.3, SAS Institute,
Inc., Cary, NC) for data analyses.

During the study period, VAERS received a total of 2976 US
PCV13 reports in persons aged P19 years, 2103 (71%) after
PCV13 was administered alone. Of these reports, 465 (16%) were
in persons aged 19–64 years which included 24 non-death serious
reports; 2511 (84%) in persons aged P65 years, which included
138 non-death serious reports and 14 death reports (Table 1).
For both age-groups, the majority of reports were after PCV13
administered alone: 286 (62%) for 19–64 years and 1817 (72%)
for P65 years. In persons aged 19–64 years, 37(8%) PCV13 was
administered with zoster vaccine; in persons aged P65 years,
376 (15%) PCV13 was administered with high-dose influenza.
Injection site erythema and injection site pain and swelling were
the most frequently reported AEs for both age groups (Table 1).

3.2. Clinical review
3.2.1. Reports of death
We identified 14 reports of death receiving PCV13, all in adults
P65 years old. The median onset interval from vaccination to
death was 13 days (range 0–120 days). Most of these reports,
11/14 (79%) listed PCV13 as the only vaccine administered; two
also received influenza vaccine and one also received ZostavaxÒ.
The median age was 81 years (range 68–89). All 14 individuals
had an underlying chronic condition, e.g., coronary artery diseases,
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Causes of death included
pneumonia (4), congestive heart failure (3), Parkinson’s disease
(2), arrhythmia (1), Cryptococci meningitis (1), intracerebral hemorrhage (1), sepsis (1), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
(1).

3.2.2. Non-death serious reports
There were a total of 162 reports of serious non-death AEs: 24
(15%) in adults aged 19–64 years and 138 (85%) in adults aged
P65 years (Tables 2a and 2b). Injection site reactions (5, 21%)
and general malaise (4, 16%) were the most commonly reported
AEs among adults 19–64 years, whereas injection site reactions
(35, 25%), and pneumonia (16, 12%) were the AEs most frequently
reported among adults aged P65 years. PCV13 was administered
alone in 17 (71%) adults aged 19–64 years and 119 (78%) in those
aged P65 years. General disorders and administration site conditions was the most frequently reported MedDRA System Organ
Class (SOC) [11], followed by infection and infestations disorders
(Tables 2a and 2b). We identified three reports of patients with

female who received only PCV13 and had injection site swelling
and anaphylactic reaction.
3.3.2. Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS)
We identified 11 reports of possible GBS after PCV13. The median onset interval of symptoms was 9 days (range 2–34 days).
Median age was 68 years (range 56–88); ten cases were males.
Eight cases had sufficient information to meet Brighton case definition [18] for GBS (four Level 1, four Level 2); three were based on
physician diagnosis. Ten reports listed PCV13 as the only vaccine
administered. One report was in a male who also received highdose influenza vaccine and was diagnosed with GBS 11 day’s

6333

post- vaccination. One case had an upper respiratory infection
16 days prior to GBS.
3.3.3. Vaccine administration errors
3.3.3.1. PCV13 and PPSV23 on the same visit. There were 18 nonserious reports in persons who received PCV13 and PPSV23 during
the same visit. Median age was 48 years (range 19–80 years); onset
interval ranged from 0 (day of vaccination) to 4 days. In most (71%)
of these reports, injection site, and systemic reactions (e.g., pain,
fatigue, dizziness and nausea) were reported. The safety profile
was similar to reports of PCV13 administered alone.
3.3.3.2. PPSV23 or PCV13 within 4 weeks prior to PCV13. We identified three non-serious reports of persons who received PPSV23 or
PCV13 within 4 weeks prior to current PCV13 vaccination: (1) a
chronic immunocompromised 32-year-old female received
PPSV23 4 weeks prior to PCV13 and presented swelling and pain
of the entire upper arm; (2) a 74-year-old of unknown sex received
another PCV13 with no AE specified in the report; (3) an immunocompromised 46-year-old male who received 4 weeks prior PCV13
and other vaccines (Hib/DTaP/IPV and Hep B) presented with swollen arm, shoulder and elbow and whose symptoms resolved within
4 days without treatment.
3.3.3.3. Other vaccine administration errors. We identified 19 nonserious reports of individual’s inappropriate schedule of drug
administered/extra dose. Those individuals received two doses of
PCV13 within an interval ranging from <1 month to <1 year; age
range was 57 through 85 years; no AEs were reported.
3.4. Data mining
Through December 31, 2015, data mining analysis revealed disproportional reporting for the following MedDRA preferred terms
(PTs): vaccination site cellulitis, local reaction, skin reaction, and
skin swelling for PCV13. Because these are injection sitereactions reported in pre-licensure studies of PCV13 or general
non-specific signs or symptoms, no further review was conducted.
No disproportional reporting was observed for other PTs, including
GBS or other neurological conditions.
4. Discussion
This study represents the first post-marketing safety review of
PCV13 in adults. From 2012 through 2015, approximately 16 million doses of PCV13 were distributed for use among adults aged
P19 years in the United States (Pfizer data on file). We reviewed
AEs reported to VAERS following PCV13 in adults P19 years and
did not identify any new safety concerns or unexpected AEs. The
most commonly reported AEs (injection site redness, swelling
and pain) were similar for both age-groups and similar to the
PCV13 pre-licensure safety trials in adults [1,3,7].
Approximately 95% of PCV13 reports were non-serious, and the
most common AEs were mild, self-limited conditions (e.g., injection site pain and swelling, erythema and fever). Most common
non-death serious reports were general disorders and administration site conditions, infections and infestations, and cardiac disorders. We reviewed both non-death serious and pre-specified
conditions and did not observe any unexpected AEs for immunocompromised persons or in persons who received both PCV13
and PPSV23 on the same visit or PPSV23 within 4 weeks prior to
PCV13. However, the available number of reports was limited
and based on the provider reporting information on previous
PCV13 and/or PPSV23 vaccinations and availability of medical

6334

P. Haber et al. / Vaccine 34 (2016) 6330–6334

records; some reports may not have reported prior PCV13 or
PPSV23 vaccination history.
In rare instances, anaphylaxis may be causally associated with
vaccination [14,15]. Our review identified only one case of anaphylaxis with insufficient evidence to meet the Brighton criteria for
anaphylaxis.
Our study verified 11 GBS reports with symptom onset within
42 days of PCV13 vaccination with a reporting rate of 0.7 cases
per million doses of vaccine distributed among adults aged
P19 years. One individual also received high-dose influenza vaccine on the same visit, and one other had evidence of prior illness.
Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS) is an acute, immune-mediated
demyelinating disorder of the peripheral nervous system [16–
21]. The 1976 swine flu vaccine was found to be causally associated with GBS [17]; however, evidence of a possible association
of GBS with inactivated seasonal influenza vaccines has been
inconsistent [16,19–21]. Our data mining analysis noted no disproportionate reporting for GBS.
We reviewed the 14 death reports after PCV13 vaccination
where the causes of death were consistent with the leading causes
of death for this age-group [24], thereby not revealing a pattern
that would suggest a possible association between the vaccine
and death. Overall, the proportion of reported serious adverse
events was low—5.2% in the 19–64 year old group and 6% in the
P65 year old group.
It is important to note the limitations of VAERS, which may
include underreporting, varying quality of reports (for example,
reports may lack details, contain errors or be missing information),
and the lack of an unvaccinated comparison group [8,9]. Medical
records of serious reports obtained through follow-up may not
contain important key clinical and/or laboratory information.
Because of these limitations, it is extremely difficult to determine
causal associations between vaccines and AEs. However, VAERS
may be effective for promptly detecting rare AEs and potential vaccine safety problems. Any vaccine safety signal detected in VAERS
needs to be further studied in carefully designed epidemiology
studies [25,26].
5. Conclusion
We did not identify any new safety signals when reviewing
VAERS reports following PCV13 administration in adults. Our data
is consistent with data from the pre-licensure clinical trials and
post-licensure safety assessments and the vaccine appears to be
well tolerated in older adults. CDC will continue to monitor this
vaccine’s safety in the adult population since the vaccine has only
recently been routinely recommended for persons aged 65 years or
older.
