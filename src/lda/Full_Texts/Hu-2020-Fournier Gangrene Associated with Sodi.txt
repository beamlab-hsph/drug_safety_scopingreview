Background. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) released a safety warning of Fournier gangrene (FG), a rare but serious
adverse eﬀect of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors in August 2018. However, existing studies have focused
mainly on individual FG case reports. Although several previous studies conducted reviews of cases, objective scientiﬁc analysis
was not applied, and the prognosis data were inadequate. Objective. This study is aimed at presenting data supplementary to
existing studies by analysing postmarketing adverse event reports in the FDA Adverse Events Reporting System (FAERS)
database. Multiple statistical analysis methods were applied to evaluate the potential association between SGLT2 inhibitors and
FG, thus providing reliable and professionalized medication usage recommendations for SGLT2 inhibitors in clinical practice.
Methods. Disproportionality analysis and Bayesian analysis were applied for data mining among the suspected adverse event
reports of FG associated with SGLT2 inhibitors recorded in the FAERS database during the period from January 2004 to
September 2019. Results. There were 542 FG cases identiﬁed in the FAERS database in patients receiving SGLT2 inhibitors.
Among all SGLT2 inhibitor therapies, empagliﬂozin was associated with the highest number of FG reports (232 in total), while
empagliﬂozin plus metformin had the strongest association with FG occurrence with the reporting odds ratio (ROR 54.79, 95%
two-sided CI 31.56 to 95.12) and proportional reporting ratio (PRR 53.36, χ2 666.70). There were 391 patients who underwent
initial or prolonged hospitalization (72.14%), and 26 patients died (4.81%). Three new FG cases caused by ertugliﬂozin were
found in 2019. Conclusion. The analysis of SGLT2 inhibitor-associated FG reports in the FAERS database identiﬁed signals
between the drug and adverse events of interest. It also provides comprehensive information on the characteristics of FG onset
and prognosis. Clinicians should pay more attention to this rare but severe adverse event when prescribing SGLT2 inhibitors in
clinical practice.

1. Introduction
Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are a
relatively new drug category used for type 2 diabetes mellitus
treatment in adults. They prohibit the normal functions of
SGLT2, which are primarily expressed in the kidney, responsible for reabsorption of glucose from the glomerular ﬁltration
back into circulation, leading to urinary glucose excretion,

thus lowering blood sugar. Unlike other oral antidiabetic
drugs, SGLT2 inhibitors have no eﬀects on endogenous glucose secretion and act independently of insulin production
and pathways. This urinary glucose excretion also results
in urinary volume increase and caloric loss [1]. SGLT2
inhibitors are recommended as second-line antidiabetics
based on the American Diabetes Association (AMA) Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes 2019. They are the best

2
choice for type 2 diabetes patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), heart failure (HF), or chronic
kidney disease (CKD) [2].
However, it is believed that increased glucosuria can
trigger urogenital tract infections and genital infections,
which are the most common side eﬀects of SGLT2 inhibitors [3, 4]. In addition, SGLT2i is also associated with a
rare but life-threatening disease, the necrotizing fasciitis
(NF) of the perineum, which is also referred to as Fournier’s
gangrene (FG). The FDA has released a warning about the
occurrence of the FG that triggered by the usage of SGLT2i.
It can aﬀect the perianal, genitourinary, and perineal areas
with the common symptoms of scrotal swelling, fever, and
pain [5, 6]. In general, the mortality rate of FG can reach
approximately 40% [7]. Urgent surgical debridement and
broad-spectrum antibiotics are the key interventions. Also,
approximately 20-70% of FG cases are associated with diabetes mellitus [5].
Although an increasing number of studies have aimed at
exploring the potential association between FG and SGLT2
inhibitors, most of them were case reports or lacked scientiﬁc
analysis. Thus, the objective of our study is to utilize multiple
statistical analysis and data mining methods to analyse the
possible association between diﬀerent SGLT2 inhibitors and
FG risks among spontaneous reports in the FAERS database.
Furthermore, we present more comprehensive information
on patient characterizations and prognosis outcomes as
supplementary data to previous studies to provide advice
on the clinical usage of SGLT2 inhibitors.
There are a large number of clinical trials, case reports,
and other studies aimed at exploring the potential association
between FG and SGLT2 inhibitors. Yet the overall number,
follow-up, and size of trials are too low to draw liable conclusions, and patients enrolled in clinical trials cannot fully
represent those who can receive a drug prescription in clinical practice, though the randomization procedure minimizes
the possibility of bias [8–10]. While case reports are lack of
ability to generalize. In contrary, the pharmacovigilance
research with data from spontaneous reports is a valuable
source of information to characterize the FG reports and
identify potential risk factors [8]. Thus, the objective of our
study is to utilize multiple statistical analysis and data mining
methods to analyse the possible association between diﬀerent
SGLT2 inhibitors and FG risks among spontaneous reports
in the FAERS database. Furthermore, we present more
comprehensive information on patient characterizations
and prognosis outcomes as supplementary data to previous
studies to provide advice on the clinical usage of SGLT2
inhibitors.

2. Methods
2.1. Data Sources. We conducted a retrospective pharmacovigilance study that included all FG reports among patients
treated with SGLT2 inhibitors from the ﬁrst quarter of 2004
to the third quarter of 2019 in the U.S. FAERS database. This
database was established by the FDA to support its postmarketing safety surveillance programme for drugs and therapeutic biologic products. It is a well-organized spontaneous

Journal of Diabetes Research
reporting database that contains adverse events resulting
from medication error reports, adverse event reports, and
product quality complaints. The FAERS accepts global voluntary reports from healthcare professionals (physicians,
pharmacists, nurses, and others), consumers (patients, family
members, lawyers, and others), and drug companies.
A duplication process was then conducted, and other
causes of FG among patients taking SGLT2 inhibitors were
excluded. We screened 13,229,847 reports from the FAERS
database and removed duplicated records according to the
FDA’s recommendations by selecting the latest FDA_DT
when the CASEID and FDA_DT were the same. We ultimately included 11,115,435 reports for further analysis.
2.2. Adverse Event and Drug Identiﬁcation. After literature
review and summary of previous studies, we queried the
FAERS to collect submitted FG reports in association with
SGLT2 inhibitor treatment by applying the following
preferred names from the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory
Activities Terminology (MedDRA, version 22.1): fasciitis
[10016228], fascial infection [10056515], Fournier’s gangrene [10017068], necrotizing fasciitis [10028885], necrotizing fasciitis staphylococcal [10028887], necrotizing fasciitis
streptococcal [10028888], necrotizing soft tissue infection
[10076637], perineal abscess [10052457], perineal cellulitis
[10078797], perineal infection [19966876], perineal necrosis
[10076566], perineal operation [10062068], scrotal abscess
[10049571], scrotal gangrene [10039748], vulval abscess
[10047732], and vulval cellulitis [10047752]. The MICROMEDEX (Index Nominum) was used as a dictionary of
SGLT2 inhibitors (Table 1).
2.3. Data Mining. To investigate the potential signals between
the drug and the speciﬁc adverse event of interest, disproportionality analysis and Bayesian analysis were applied with the
use of the reporting odds ratio (ROR), proportional reporting
ratio (PRR), Bayesian conﬁdence propagation neural network
(BCPNN), and multi-item gamma Poisson shrinker (MGPS)
algorithms. One of the four algorithms meet the criteria
should be considered as a positive signal of FG.
The equations and criteria for the four algorithms above
[11–19] are demonstrated in Table 2. The adverse events
were collected as long as ≥1 index met the criteria.

2.4. Statistical Analysis. Descriptive analysis was applied to
summarize and present the clinical characteristics of the
patients in FG reports. The time to onset of FG induced by
diﬀerent SGLT2 inhibitor therapies was compared by nonparametric tests (the Mann-Whitney test for dichotomous
variables and the Kruskal-Wallis test for >2 subgroups of
respondents) since the data were not normally distributed.
Pearson’s chi-square test or Fisher’s exact test was utilized
to compare the mortality rate of FG in patients receiving different SGLT2 inhibitors. Statistical signiﬁcance was declared
at P < 0:05 with 95% conﬁdence intervals (CIs). The data
mining and statistical analysis were assessed by SAS version
9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA).

3. Results
In total, there were 42,531 FG adverse events retrieved
from the FAERS database during the period from 2004q1

to 2019q3, in which 5562 were in correlation with the
usage of SGLT2 inhibitor therapies. After excluding duplications, 542 reports met our criteria and were identiﬁed.
The detailed information of the reports is shown in
Table 3. As for the basic characteristics of the patients,
the FG occurrence in males (64.3%) was signiﬁcantly
higher than that in females (27.9%), with 7.8% of
unknown gender. Except for two patients aged <18 years,
all patients were adults, with an average age of 55.6 years
(range from 0 to 87 years). For the reports, approximately
two-thirds of overall reports were submitted by healthcare
professionals, with the majority reported from North
America. The number of FG reports ﬂuctuated between
2014 and 2017 and then experienced a signiﬁcant rise
from 103 to 407 reports in 2018 and 2019, respectively.
Initial or prolonged hospitalization was the most common
outcome event. The FG onset time in patients received
SGLT2 inhibitors as single antidiabetic treatment was

analysis indicated that empagliﬂozin had the strongest
potential associations with FG occurrence, with ROR
(46.70, 95% two-sided CI 40.61 to 53.70), PRR (45.70, χ2
8798.23), IC (5.46, IC025 4.75), and EBGM (44.02, EBGM05
39.16) values. Additionally, 26 patients died. Three FG cases
were newly reported related to the use of ertugliﬂozin. No FG
cases caused by dapagliﬂozin/saxagliptin, ertugliﬂozin/metformin, ertugliﬂozin/sitagliptin, ipragliﬂozin, luseogliﬂozin,
or tofogliﬂozin were reported in the FAERS; the last three
have been approved in Japan.

4. Discussion
To our knowledge, this study involved comprehensive
information (relative to previous studies) of patients,
reporting SGLT2 inhibitor usage and prognosis in spontaneous reports with the longest time interval in the FAERS
database. The timing of FG onset and the mortality rate
were assessed as well.
Overall, 542 SGLT2 inhibitor-associated FG case reports
were identiﬁed in the FAERS database from January 2004 to
September 2019, while the total report number in Table 3 was
534, which resulted in inadequate information presented in
some of the reports. Based on our research, the average age
was 55.6 years. Two patients were <18 years old, which was
considered oﬀ-label use according to the SGLT2 inhibitor
instructions. These data were consistent with the study
conducted by Fadini et al. [20], though the sample size was
relatively small, with 31 men and 11 women and a mean
age of 58.9 years. We found that FG was more common in
men (64.3%) than in women (27.9%). It seems that adult
men with type 2 diabetes are more susceptible to FG. The reasons for the relatively lower occurrence of FG in women
could relate to the better drainage of the perineal region by
vaginal secretions in females [21], as well as physicians’ lack
of recognition of FG symptoms in women [22].

Based on the literature review, few studies have performed analyses on report characteristics in detail. However, it is essential to analyse the voluntary reports in
various aspects to gain an overall understanding of the
changes in the FG occurrence and the tendency for a particular reporting. The FAERS database accepts the suspected
adverse events from consumers, healthcare professionals,
and manufacturers. In our study, 319 (58.86%) FG reports
were submitted by healthcare professionals, of which
43.00% were reported by physicians. Consumers (including
two lawyers) were responsible for 193 (35.61%) of the overall
reports. We also found that the number of submitted reports
experienced a signiﬁcant rise from 1 case in 2014 to 407 additional cases in 2019. Fadini et al. showed that the FG report
rate increased fourfold in 2018q4 (with 51 new cases) since
the FDA warning. This dramatic increase might be due to
the popularity of the usage of SGLT2 inhibitors rising rapidly
worldwide along with the increased needs of patients with a
high occurrence of diabetes [20]. The awareness of SGLT2
inhibitor safety among patients was strengthened as well
[23]. In addition, this may reﬂect that SGLT2 inhibitors
were being used in progressively fewer selected populations, with FG-predisposing factors such as an impaired
immune system.
There are 1019 concomitant drugs in total with the usage
of SGLT2 inhibitors taken by patients with FG, which
includes 316 (31.00%) antidiabetic medicines. Medications
used to treat cardiovascular disorders were the most common concomitant drugs in this study, with the percentage
of 34.84%. Metformin and insulin treatments are the major
concomitant antidiabetic drugs with a proportion of 34.81%
and 31.01%, respectively (Table 5). The onset time of FG with
patients under SGLT2 inhibitors as single treatment as well
as SGLT2 inhibitors concomitant with other glucoselowering medication (GLM) therapies is shown in Figure 1.
Overall, 449 cases were founded in the FAERS database with
the information of FG occurrence time. After removing the

inhibitors alone and 52 patients were on the other antidiabetic treatments along with the use of the SGLT2 inhibitors.
The mean FG onset time of SGLT2 inhibitors as the single
treatment for patients was 293 days, with a range of 0 to
1365 days. The metformin was the most commonly used
antidiabetic drug compared to other antihyperglycemic
drugs; the average onset time was 373 days (range from
0 to 1696 days) when used in combination with SGLT2

inhibitors. We consider conducting further scientiﬁc analysis between the onset time of FG associated with diﬀerent
drug therapies; however, the data was too small to make a
valuable comparison.
As a single report could contain more than one outcome,
826 clinical outcomes were collected. After removing
duplicates, 534 valid reports were identiﬁed from the
FAERS database. Among these, initial or prolonged hospitalization was the most common clinical outcome among
all SGLT2 inhibitor treatments. A study indicated a similar
result, with 53 patients hospitalized (initial or prolonged)
in all 55 cases [24]. Approximately one-ﬁfth of patients
were in life-threatening status. Another essential ﬁnding
was that no FG cases reported ertugliﬂozin as a primary
suspect in any existing study, which might be due to its
shorter marketing time as a newly approved SGLT2 inhibitor
[20, 24]. Nevertheless, 3 new FG cases developed because of
the usage of ertugliﬂozin in 2019. This was also the drug with
the shortest FG average onset time (223 days) among all
SGLT2 inhibitor regimens. Therefore, the FG adverse event
could be seen as a class eﬀect of all SGLT2 inhibitor therapies.
These data can serve as supplementary information for existing SGLT2 inhibitor-associated FG studies. Although no FG
cases associated with ertugliﬂozin/metformin or ertugliﬂozin/sitagliptin have been reported to date, attention should
be paid by healthcare professionals when using them in
clinical practice.
Notably, one case with type 1 diabetes mellitus was 53
years old and received Farxiga® as the antidiabetic treatment.
However, there was no record of the exact FG onset time of
this patient, and the outcome was classiﬁed as “other serious
(important medical event).” The package inserts of Farxiga®
clearly note that this drug is not recommended for patients
with type 1 diabetes mellitus [25]. The FDA has not approved
any SGLT2 inhibitors for this particular indication, although
several clinical trials are ongoing. Joury et al. and Wu et al.
supposed that SGLT2 inhibitors can deteriorate ketogenesis

Journal of Diabetes Research
and contribute to DKA, particularly in patients with type 1
diabetes [7, 26]. Hence, the beneﬁt-risk relationship between
the usage of SGLT2 inhibitors and type 1 diabetes mellitus
still needs to be further assessed. Whether this oﬀ-label usage
of SGLT2 inhibitors was reasonable may need more evidence.
To investigate the potential association between diﬀerent
SGLT2 inhibitor therapies and FG occurrence, disproportionality analysis and Bayesian analysis were applied
(Table 4). Empagliﬂozin was associated with the highest
number of FG reports, 232 in total, followed by canagliﬂozin
and dapagliﬂozin, with 199 and 108 reports, respectively. The
results show that empagliﬂozin had the strongest association
with the onset of FG, with higher ROR, PRR, IC, and EBGM
values than any other SGLT2 inhibitors. There was no previous study applying disproportionality analysis and Bayesian
analysis in SGLT2 inhibitors; thus, these data could be utilized as compensatory information. It is widely known that
diabetes is a risk factor for FG, and some studies have investigated the association between diabetes, FG, and SGLT2
inhibitor therapies. They conﬁrmed that the association with
FG was more speciﬁc for SGLT2 inhibitor therapies than
diabetes [20]. Furthermore, our previous research suggested
that dapagliﬂozin treatment was associated with an increased
risk of developing genital infections [4]. We therefore advocate conducting more drug pharmacovigilance programmes
for SGLT2 inhibitors so that the awareness of those serious
adverse eﬀects among patients and clinicians will be
enhanced, especially when choosing a treatment.
A notoriety bias indeed exists that is a selection bias in
which a case has a greater chance of being reported if the
subject is exposed to the studied factor known to cause,
thought to cause, or likely to cause the event of interest. Thus,
it could partly explain the increasing FG reports numbers
after FDA warning in August 2018. It is a common issue that
happens in lots of drugs. A study conducted by Neha et al.
conﬁrms that notoriety bias does not lead to overreporting
in the FAERS database, and the overall disproportionality
in signal estimates is not changed by the safety alert [10].
However, this study does have some limitations. First, for
the FAERS database, a major concern was underreporting of
adverse events, although the “consumer-friendly” reporting
form FDA3500B was developed [27]. The data mining
approach cannot compensate for this limitation. Moreover,
adverse event reports might be associated with false and
incomplete information since not all reporters have expertise
in pharmacovigilance activities, leading to the quality of the
reports being diﬀerent. The relationship between the occurrence of the reported event and the product was uncertain,
as the FDA did not require reporters to provide evidence
on the causal relationship between a product and the event.
Also, the spontaneous reporting system cannot quantify the
adverse reaction signals of FG on the basis of the total
number of adverse reactions. It also cannot calculate the
exact incidence of SGLT2 inhibitor-associated FG, since the
association between a drug and an adverse drug reaction is
confounded by concomitant drugs and comorbidities [28].
Detailed information is also needed from clinical follow-up
and other surveys to verify our data mining hypotheses.
Finally, the data mining approach was not suﬃcient to prove

a causal relationship between a drug and an adverse event,
though it can perform signal detection.

5. Conclusions
In summary, our study applied multiple statistical analysis
approaches to identify the signals of FG caused by diﬀerent
SGLT2 inhibitors in the FAERS database. This study also
presented comprehensive prognosis data as supplementary
information to existing studies. Empagliﬂozin had the greatest association with the occurrence of FG and the highest
mortality rate. Even the new SGLT2 inhibitor member could
also induce FG. Moreover, the total number of FG reports in
the FAERS database has increased signiﬁcantly. Since it is
expected that the number of SGLT2 inhibitor users will
continually increase in the future, paying more attention to
severe adverse events is very important even if they are
extremely rare.
Thus, the drug pharmacovigilance programme is necessary and essential to monitor FG in diabetic adults
receiving SGLT2 inhibitors to evaluate drug safety concerns,
facilitating the FDA to improve product safety and protect
public health. Further pharmacoepidemiological studies are
needed to provide more reliable evidence for the use of
SGLT2 inhibitors in clinical practice.
