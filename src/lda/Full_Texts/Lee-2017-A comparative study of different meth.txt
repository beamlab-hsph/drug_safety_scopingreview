Abstract
Electronic health records (EHRs) linked with biobanks have been recognized as valuable data sources for
pharmacogenomic studies, which require identification of patients with certain adverse drug reactions (ADRs) from
a large population. Since manual chart review is costly and time-consuming, automatic methods to accurately
identify patients with ADRs have been called for. In this study, we developed and compared different informatics
approaches to identify ADRs from EHRs, using clopidogrel-induced bleeding as our case study. Three different
types of methods were investigated: 1) rule-based methods; 2) machine learning-based methods; and 3) scoring
function-based methods. Our results show that both machine learning and scoring methods are effective and the
scoring method can achieve a high precision with a reasonable recall. We also analyzed the contributions of
different types of features and found that the temporality information between clopidogrel and bleeding events, as
well as textual evidence from physicians’ assertion of the adverse events are helpful. We believe that our findings
are valuable in advancing EHR-based pharmacogenomic studies.
INTRODUCTION
Large electronic health records (EHRs) databases have emerged as valuable data sources for clinical and
translational research1,2. Moreover, EHR databases have also been linked to archived biological materials to
accelerate research in personalized medicine3, e.g., identifying common and rare genetic variants that contribute to
risk of diseases or to drug efficacy and toxicity (pharmacogenomics, or PGx). For example, the eMERGE network
(electronic MEdical Records and GEnomics)4 is a consortium of 10 institutions, each of which has DNA biobanks
coupled to large comprehensive EHRs. The longitudinal nature of the data contained within the EHRs make them
ideal for quantifying drug outcome events (both efficacy and toxicity). Biobanks that are linked to large EHRs
become ideal resources for PGx studies5,6, as they could overcome key challenges to advancing PGx discovery,
such as the infrequency of adverse drug events, need for study of diverse populations, and rare variants. Successful
stories about new PGx findings based on EHR-linked biobanks have been reported for many drugs, including
warfarin5,6 and clopidogrel7, and promising results for new PGx discoveries with heparin-induced
thrombocytopenia8, vancomycin drug levels9, and ACE-inhibitor induced cough10. These studies typically used
rule-based algorithms combined with focused manual review. Another recent study explored warfarin related
bleeds, but was particularly challenging requiring significant manual review11.
One of the challenges for EHR-based PGx studies is to identify patients with specific adverse drug reactions (ADR)
after a drug exposure. It is costly and time-consuming to recruit domain experts to review medical charts to identify
such cases. Therefore, informatics methods that can automatically identify drug-induced adverse events have been
investigated. Sai and colleagues12 developed an algorithm to detect statin-induced myopathy from EHRs. They
mined structured data to extract lab test results, ICD codes and the dates of statin prescription. By incorporating the
time course information of creatinine kinase values, the lab test indicator of myopathy, their rule-based method
achieved 100% precision in identifying patients with statin-induced myopathy. Haerian and colleagues13 proposed
identification of cases where the adverse event is due to a patient’s pre-condition(s) and medication(s). They

185

focused on two ADRs, rhabdomyolysis and agranulocytosis, and developed a rule-based system which employs
natural language processing (NLP) and expert-generated list of known risk factors. Their system showed a
sensitivity of 93.8 % and a specificity of 91.8 %. Lin and colleagues14 proposed an automatic identification method
for methotrexate-induced liver toxicity among patients with rheumatoid arthritis. They provided their system with
several pieces of temporal information; their SVM classifier was trained on 3-month-long episode level, using
features that are designed to reflect temporality such as verb tense. They achieved precision of 80.0% and recall of
89.9%.
Our long-term goal is to develop automatic methods to accurately identify cases and controls for EHR-based PGx
studies. In this study, we developed and compared different informatics approaches to identify clopidogrel-induced
bleeds in Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC). We selected clopidogrel-induced bleedings as a use case
since an ongoing PGx study about clopidogrel already exists wherein the research team has reviewed patients’
medical records to determine cases of clopidogrel-induced bleedings. Clopidogrel is often used in association with
aspirin (Dual anti-platelet therapy, DAPT) to inhibit platelet function thereby to prevent recurrent adverse
cardiovascular events in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) undergoing percutaneous coronary
intervention15, While DAPT is widely used as recommended by the current guidelines16, the therapy is also
associated with an increased risk of potentially life-threatening adverse bleeding events17,18. It is known that there is
a great inter-individual variation in clopidogrel response; approximately 70% of which is heritable19. Although the
common loss of function CYP2C19*2 variant is known to be a major determinant that explains about 12% of the
variation in clopidogrel responses20,21, the majority of the heritable variation remains to be discovered.
Identification of such gene variants that determine clopidogrel responses, especially those that will lead to adverse
bleeding events, will provide the opportunity for more effective anti-platelet therapy through genotype-informed
prescribing. Since relevant gene variants can often be relatively rare, larger sample sizes are required to determine
the roles of gene variants in clopidogrel responses.
Both structured (ICD-9 codes) and unstructured (clinical notes) data were collected from the EHR and NLP
technologies were applied to extract bleeding and clopidogrel information from the clinical documents. The NLP
methods that we developed and evaluated were of three different types: 1) rule-based methods; 2) machine
learning-based methods; and 3) scoring function-based methods. Both machine learning and scoring methods were
shown to be effective, while the scoring method showed a high precision with a reasonable recall. In addition, our
analysis on the contributions of different types of features showed that the temporality information between
clopidogrel and bleeding events, as well as textual evidence from physicians’ assertion of the adverse events are
helpful. We believe such valuable findings will advance EHR-based pharmacological and PGx studies.
METHODS
Datasets
At VUMC, there is an ongoing PGx study that aims to determine associations with increased adverse bleeding
events after clopidogrel exposure, using the DNA bank bioVU and the Synthetic Derivative (SD) database22, a deidentified copy of VUMC’s EHR database. For this project, the research team identified a cohort of 2,268 patients
who potentially had clopidogrel-induced bleedings. The cohort selection criterion was based on structured EHR
data - it required a bleeding ICD-9 code (decided by domain experts) within the first and last mention of
clopidogrel in a patient’s medical record. Then, nurses manually reviewed the medical charts of these 2,268
potential cases and identified 1,921 true cases that had bleedings caused by clopidogrel and 347 “non-cases” that
do not have bleeding events caused by clopidogrel. In this study, our task is to use various types of EHR data to
automatically identify cases among the 2,268 patients that had bleedings caused by clopidogrel. We divided the
2,268 candidate patients into a training set of 1,512 patients (two thirds), on which we developed and trained our
methods, and a test set of 756 patients (one third), on which we evaluated our methods.
Feature extraction
For each patient in the cohort, we collected both structured (e.g., ICD-9 codes from all steps of clinical pipelines)
and unstructured (e.g., clinical notes) data from SD. For example, the training set contained a total of 709,076
clinical notes, and the test set contained 343,674 notes. Every note was then processed using two NLP tools:
MedEx and KnowledgeMap Concept Identifier (KMCI). MedEx23 extracts drug names along with its signature
information such as ‘strength’, ‘route’, ‘frequency’, ‘form’, ‘dose’, and ‘duration’. KMCI24 is a general clinical

186

NLP system developed at VUMC that extracts clinical entities and maps them to Concept Unique Identifiers
(CUIs) in the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS). For our purposes, negated concepts were removed from
the outputs.
After discussion with the domain experts, we identified the following features that may help identify clopidogrelinduced bleedings, including:
Bleeding information: Three types of bleeding information were extracted: 1) A set of 109 ICD9 codes about
bleedings, as identified by domain experts; 2) A set of 465 CUIs related to bleeding, by expanding the ICD9
bleeding codes following the UMLS hierarchy. We checked for the presence of any of these 465 CUIs in a
patient’s clinical notes, based on KMCI’s outputs; 3) A set of 51 keywords that are related to bleedings, as defined
by domain experts. When we reviewed bleeding CUIs extracted by KMCI, we noticed that some frequently
mentioned bleeding terms such as ‘epistaxis’ and ‘melena’ were missed by KMCI. Therefore, we collected 51
keywords and developed a regular expression program to extract these keywords (non-negated) from clinical notes.
Clopidogrel information: Based on MedEx’s outputs, we extracted several features about clopidogrel exposure,
e.g., how many times clopidogrel was mentioned, how many times it was mentioned with a dose, or frequency.
Temporality information between bleeding and clopidogrel events: It is critical to know how closely a bleeding
event occurred to a clopidogrel mention. Therefore, we collected timestamps of all the bleeding and clopidogrel
mentions extracted earlier. The timestamp information was obtained either from the date of ICD-codes or the date
of clinical notes that mentioned bleeding (recognized through CUIs or keywords). Once we had the timeline of all
bleeding and clopidogrel mentions of a patient, we calculated the shortest duration between a clopidogrel mention
and a bleeding event as a feature. Domain experts also pointed out that other clinical events such as ‘chest tube’,
‘stab wound’, and ‘menses’ could also cause bleedings. Therefore, we compiled a list of these events (13
keywords) and identified their timestamps on the timeline as well. We then calculated durations between these
events and bleedings which were then supplied as additional temporality features.
Explicit evidence from physicians’ assertion: We also noticed that clinical notes sometimes contain physicians’
assertions about bleedings caused by clopidogrel. For instance, the sentence “Bleeding was substantial from all raw
surfaces owing to the fact that the patient was on double antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel” clearly
states that the bleeding was caused by clopidogrel. Therefore, we deemed that it would be helpful to identify
clopidogrel-induced bleedings by recognizing such explicit statements by the physicians. We employed a simple
heuristic rule to detect such explicit evidence: if a sentence mentioned both clopidogrel and bleeding and had no
negation phrase, we considered it to be explicit evidence and used it as a feature for classification.
Classification methods
After we extracted the above mentioned features, we developed three different types of methods to classify if a
patient was a case (having clopidogrel-induced bleedings) or not by utilizing these features:
Rule-based methods: The rule-based methods employed two rules. The first rule was based on the temporality
information. Given a patient’s timeline with dates of clopidogrel, bleeding, and other bleeding causes, we identified
whether there was bleeding after a mention of clopidogrel without any other event(s) that may cause bleeding inbetween. The second rule was based on explicit evidence. If a patient’s clinical notes contained a sentence that
mentioned both clopidogrel and bleeding without any negation, the patient was classified as a ‘case’. We evaluated
the performance of each rule individually as well as both rules together.
Machine learning-based methods: In this approach, we trained support vector machine (SVM) classifiers using
different sets of features. We used LibSVM package25 as the implementation of SVM and optimized the parameters
using the training set. We evaluated the contribution of different types of features as described below: 1) features
containing basic bleeding and clopidogrel information only, e.g., the numbers of bleeding CUIs, ICD codes, and
keywords, and the number of clopidogrel mentions; 2) temporality information between clopidogrel and bleeding,
as described above; and 3) explicit evidence feature extracted from clinical notes; and 4) combined features of both
temporality information and explicit evidence.
Scoring-based method: The scoring-based system calculated a score for each patient to indicate the likelihood of
the patient’s having a clopidogrel-induced bleeding. If the score was equal to or greater than a pre-set cut-off value,
the patient was classified as a ‘case’, otherwise as ‘non-case’. The system considered the temporality information

187

and the explicit sentence evidence only. The assumption was that shorter the time duration between a clopidogrel
and a bleeding event, more likely was the patient a ‘case’. The scoring function is shown below:
𝑠=

𝑤$ 1 − 𝑓($)*+ 10,000 + 𝑤6*7( 𝑓6*7(
./+01 ∈3/+01
+

𝐹($)* denotes the set of all temporality features, whose member 𝑓($)*+ has the length of minimum time duration
from clopidogrel exposure to bleeding as its value. 𝑓($)*+ differs from one to another on the method through which
we identify the minimum time duration (e.g., the bleeding dates can be identified either by ICD codes, by CUI
mentions, or by keywords, and the time duration may or may not contain a date with other events that may cause
bleeding). 𝑓6*7( , refers to the explicit evidence feature, had value 1 when there is explicit sentence evidence and 0
otherwise. 𝑤$ and 𝑤6*7( represent weights assigned to each temporality feature and the explicit evidence feature,
respectively. The weight values were chosen empirically based on the training set.
Evaluation
We trained and developed all the systems using the training set, and evaluated them using the test set. In the past
studies of EHR phenotyping algorithms, precision (also known as positive predictive value, or PPV) is often used
to evaluate systems’ performance26. Therefore, we used PPV as the primary measure in this study. In addition, we
also reported recall (also known as sensitivity), to ensure the system did not lose too many true cases. Please note
that the recall measure here does not represent the true recall from the entire dataset, as we do not know how many
true cases exist in the complete dataset (i.e., the Vanderbilt SD) and the current dataset is not a random sample of
the entire population (i.e., the current dataset is selected from the entire population based on the ICD-9 codes; See
Datasets for more detail). Finally, we calculated F-score, harmonic mean of PPV and sensitivity, to compare
different classification methods.
RESULTS
In this section, we report the performance of the different classification methods evaluated on the 756 candidate
patients in the test set (Table 1). Among the rule-based methods, it is not surprising that the rule based on the
explicit evidence of ADR assertions by physicians achieved the highest precision (96.9%), but with a much lower
recall than the performance of the rule using temporality information. Among ML-based systems, the combined
feature sets of temporality information and explicit evidence achieved best performance (88.7% precision and
96.6% recall). For the scoring-based approach, increasing the cutoff value increased precision but lowered recall.
Overall, ML-based and scoring-based methods outperformed the simple rule-based methods when both precision
and recall are considered. If our primary goal is to achieve high precision (e.g., over 95%), the scoring-based
method would be the best option, as it achieved a precision of 95% with a reasonable recall of 65.3%.

DISCUSSION
In this study, we developed and compared different NLP methods for automatic identification of patients with
ADEs from EHRs, using clopidogrel-induced bleeding as our use case. We extracted various feature sets from both
structured data and narrative clinical notes. The uses of features derived from information about bleeding,
clopidogrel, their temporality relations, and explicit evidence from sentences were investigated, and we found that
the temporality information and explicit evidence were helpful in identifying clopidogrel-induced bleedings. We
also tested different classification strategies, i.e., rule-based, ML-based, and scoring-based methods. Although both
ML-based and scoring-based methods showed better performance than the rule-based method, the scoring-based
method seems to be more suitable if a high precision is desired. Our findings not only demonstrate the feasibility of
automatic identification of clopidogrel-induced bleedings, but also provides valuable insights to handle the ADR
case detection in general, thus to advance the EHR-based PGx studies.
Temporality between drug and ADR events is critical in this task. Despite the reasonable performance of our
systems, our current strategies for temporal information extraction, representation, and analysis are very limited.
For example, we simply assigned document time to events in a clinical note, which may generate false timestamps
of clopidogrel and bleeding, as some events could have occurred in the past or could be indicated as future
possibilities (though many of these should be filtered out using our implementation of NegEx). There are NLP
tools that recognize a concept’s temporal relation to the document time27,28. We plan to utilize such tools to produce
more accurate temporality features, as investigated by Lin and colleagues14 for methotrexate–induced liver-toxicity.
Another limitation is that we currently assume that a patient is on clopidogrel if clopidogrel is mentioned in a
clinical note. However, medication mentions could refer to different status such as “start”, “stop”, “hold”, and
“dosage change”, as described in Liu and colleagues29. To further improve the performance, we plan to adapt and
incorporate such deep drug exposure modeling methods into our systems. Furthermore, in our study, we simply
used durations between events for building the ML model, which could be replaced by more sophisticated methods
that consider entire timelines, e.g., time-series data mining techniques30,31.
The following false positive example (misclassified as a ‘case’ while being a ‘non-case’) highlights the need for
comprehensive analysis of temporality and drug status: a note on September 20th 2011 says “Recent episode of
gross hematuria at OSH with resultant demand ischemia and NSTEMI.", mentioning a bleeding event (hematuria)
that occurred before the document creation time (Sep. 20th). The note also says "Per Urology, no obvious source of
hematuria and has not reoccured in house, will proceed with anticoaguation and LHC.", from which one can
identify that the bleeding is no longer on-going as of Sep. 20th. The note goes on with “Please take plavix for three
more days total.”, where the use of the word ‘more’ indicates that the patient was taking clopidogrel (also known as
plavix) for some time. Based on the note, our annotators classified the patient as a ‘non-case’, since they inferred
that the patient had no bleeding episode whilst on clopidogrel (at least during hospitalization). However, our
classification methods classified the patient as a ‘case’, since hematuria was mentioned in several notes from
September 20th to 23rd together with clopidogrel, as it did not take into consideration the detailed analyses in
terms of temporality and drug status. Note that the above example was misclassified as a ‘case’ by all three
classification methods. Other false positives misclassified by all three methods showed similar characteristics (i.e.,
lack of proper analysis of temporality and/or drug status).
A novel and interesting finding of this study is the utilization of explicit evidence from sentences that contain
physicians’ assertions about ADRs. This new type of information was shown to be highly effective in increasing
the precision. The rule-based system using explicit evidence showed a precision of 97%. The system also showed a
recall of 29%, indicating that more than one fourth of the patients with clopidogrel-induced bleedings have an
explicit description about the causal relation between clopidogrel and bleeding in their clinical notes. Although the
explicit evidence feature already produces high precision, we expect to have further improvement by employing
NLP techniques that can precisely target the causal relation32,33. Furthermore, explicit evidence can also be utilized
to identify ‘non-case’ patient, e.g., we can identify sentences that explicitly describe that a bleeding is caused by
other medical events rather than clopidogrel. For example, the sentence “He is having significant intermittent lower
GI bleeding from radiation proctatitis”, can be a strong signal to classify a patient as a ‘non-case’, thus improving
the overall performance of the classification system.

189

This study has limitations. The gold standard was generated by an existing PGx study, which used only structured
data to generate the candidate cases. If we use different criteria for candidate case selection, both the precision and
recall reported here could change, although precision is probably more reliable measure of the two. Moreover, we
only evaluated these methods on one use case (clopidogrel-induced bleeding). We believe that PGx studies on other
similar drug adverse reactions would benefit from the findings of this study (i.e., the use of temporal information,
filtering with other possible causes of adverse event, and the use of explicit mentions of adverse reactions).
However, the generalizability of the findings from this study may need further validation. In addition, we want to
mention that application of the proposed methods to other ADR types would require additional manual work,
which includes collecting relevant ICD/CUI codes, identifying other possible causes, and selecting appropriate
parameters for classification methods (e.g., time duration for rule-based system, weights for scoring-based system).
For future work, besides method improvements on temporality and explicit evidence, we also plan to extend the
work to additional PGx studies other than clopidogrel-induced bleeding.
CONCLUSION
Identifying patients with specific ADRs is a critical step in EHR-based PGx study, but the time and labor costs for
manual chart review is huge. We investigated different informatics approaches for identification of patients with
ADRs, using clopidogrel-induced bleeding as our case study. From our experiments with different computational
methods and different types of features, we found that (1) while both ML and scoring methods are effective in
identifying patients with bleedings caused by clopidogrel, the scoring method can achieve a high precision with a
reasonable recall, and (2) temporality information between clopidogrel and bleeding events, as well as textual
evidence from physicians’ assertion of the adverse events are valuable features. In our future work, we will further
investigate the methods to improve the performance, and will apply our methods to ADRs other than clopidogrelinduced bleeding.
