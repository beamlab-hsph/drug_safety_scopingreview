Association Between Serotonin Syndrome
and Second-Generation Antipsychotics via
Pharmacological Target-Adverse Event Analysis
Rebecca Racz1,∗ , Theodoros G. Soldatos2 , David Jackson2 and Keith Burkhart1

Case reports suggest an association between second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs) and serotonin syndrome (SS). The US
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) was analyzed to generate hypotheses about how
SGAs may interact with pharmacological targets associated with SS. FAERS was integrated with additional sources to link
information about adverse events with drugs and targets. Using Proportional Reporting Ratios, we identified signals that were
further investigated with the literature to evaluate mechanistic hypotheses formed from the integrated FAERS data. Analysis
revealed common pharmacological targets perturbed in both SGA and SS cases, indicating that SGAs may induce SS. The literature also supported 5-HT2A antagonism and 5-HT1A agonism as common mechanisms that may explain the SGA-SS association.
Additionally, integrated FAERS data mining and case studies suggest that interactions between SGAs and other serotonergic
agents may increase the risk for SS. Computational analysis can provide additional insights into the mechanisms underlying
the relationship between SGAs and SS.

Study Highlights
WHAT IS THE CURRENT KNOWLEDGE ON THE TOPIC?
✔ Case reports exist that associate second-generation
antipsychotics with serotonin syndrome. A systematic analysis to identify common targets associated with both serotonin syndrome and second-generation antipsychotics has
not been performed.
WHAT QUESTION DID THIS STUDY ADDRESS?
✔ Molecular mechanisms of serotonin syndrome and
second-generation antipsychotics were examined to determine their relationships. The molecular characterization
relied on analysis of adverse events using FAERS reports
and drug target data.

Serotonin syndrome is a classification of potentially lifethreatening symptoms resulting from increased serotonin
neurotransmission. This increase of serotonin can be the
result of an overdose, drug interactions, increased therapeutic dose, or recreational drug use of a chemical
that increases serotonin concentrations. Symptoms may
include agitation, hallucinations, hyperthermia, tachycardia, and muscle twitching. First-line treatment of serotonin syndrome includes removal of the involved drug(s)
and supportive care, which can include benzodiazepines
and cyproheptadine, a nonspecific serotonin antagonist, to
counteract the increased serotonin synaptic levels.1 Serotonin syndrome can result from agonism of any of the
seven families of serotonin receptors, although stimula-

tion of 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A receptors have been primarily
implicated.1
Second-generation antipsychotic drugs were developed
as an alternative to the first-generation antipsychotics to treat
a wide variety of conditions, including schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and as an adjunctive treatment in major depressive disorder. Second-generation antipsychotic drugs were
intended to cause fewer side effects (e.g., extrapyramidal
symptoms) than first-generation antipsychotics. These drugs
are known to antagonize the dopamine (D2 ) and serotonin (5HT2A ) receptors, but many also act as partial agonists at the
5-HT1A and/or 5-HT1B receptors.2
In this study we performed a mechanistic analysis using
computational methods to understand the association

between serotonin syndrome and second-generation
antipsychotics. This mechanistic analysis examined several
variables using informatics, including potential pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions, single targets, and
the possibility of confounding to create multiple hypotheses for the association between serotonin syndrome and
second-generation antipsychotics. A large number of serotonin syndrome cases have been reported to the US Food
and Drug Administration (FDA) Adverse Event Reporting
System (FAERS) across the second-generation antipsychotics. Based on the initial profiles presented above,
partial agonism of 5-HT1A may be one mechanism. However,
second-generation antipsychotics are serotonin antagonists,
and therefore mechanistically one might expect the class
to not be associated with serotonin syndrome. Therefore,
we performed a mechanistic analysis via computational and
case analyses to determine if the signal was truly associated
with second-generation antipsychotics, what activity was
responsible, and to identify other potential mechanisms
through data mining. Additionally, this method can identify
artificial inflations due to concomitant medications and other
confounding factors. Data mining using a variety of informatics tools can quickly identify potential mechanisms, including
those involving secondary targets, to further explore using a
variety of in vivo and in vitro data. Analysis was performed
with a bioinformatics tool, EFFECTTM , using the Proportional
Reporting Ratio (PRR) to first hypothesize about potential
mechanistic associations using FAERS data integrated with
target and mechanistic data. Concomitant medications were
additionally analyzed in FAERS to investigate the possibility
of a drug–drug interaction. These hypotheses were further
investigated with literature and case analyses to provide
additional evidence for the mechanisms hypothesized by
using integrated FAERS data.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Molecular Health’s EFFECT3 platform was used to perform
adverse event analysis. The platform summarizes FAERS
data integration results and their Proportional Reporting
Ratio (PRR) characterization, as described below.
Adverse event data set
The analysis was performed using the public data set of
adverse events collected by the FDA’s FAERS. FAERS information used in this analysis included patients’ treatments
(medications), indications (disease or condition), as well as
reported adverse reactions and observed outcomes (e.g.,
“death” or “hospitalization”). Data included in this analysis
were the publicly available FAERS data set from 2004 to
2016Q2. This data set contained 8.2 million reports for 6.8
million cases.

Integration of molecular data
Using a drug-centric integration process, FAERS was
enhanced with chemical and biological data. Based
on the FAERS medication-to-drug mapping, the link to
biomolecules and molecular mechanisms involved in pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics was established via
DrugBank.3 Additional information for the integrated molecular players (such as drug targets and metabolizing enzymes)
was imported from UniProt,7 Reactome,8,9 and BioCarta.10
Statistical characterization of the adverse event data
For the statistical characterization of the observed associations in FAERS between reported drugs, indications, reactions, outcomes, and molecular players, the established
pharmacovigilance metric PRR was used. PRR quantifies the
extent of a particular binary association with respect to the
occurrence of each of its parts. The PRR metric was calculated using the approach described by van Puijenbroek
et al.11 and shown in the below example.

Experiments: Definition of cohorts
Several approaches were used to analyze potential signals and the association between serotonin syndrome and
second-generation antipsychotics (see Figure 1). Using
FAERS data, patient cohorts were defined as collections of
adverse event cases that contain a drug or reaction of interest, or multiple drugs combined and examined as one group.
The identified cohorts were then examined with respect to
features such as reported drugs, indications, reactions, or
drug classes, underlying targets and mechanisms, and their
associations with serotonin syndrome. Cohort results are
described in terms of observed case counts (i.e., number of
cases a certain occurrence was observed in) and the PRR
disproportionality score. Specifically:

antipsychotic. The following drugs were considered:
amisulpride, aripiprazole, asenapine, blonanserin,
clozapine, iloperidone, lurasidone, melperone, olanzapine, paliperidone, perospirone, quetiapine, risperidone,
sertindole, ziprasidone, zotepine, and cariprazine. This
cohort was used to identify drug targets that linked to
most second-generation antipsychotic-reporting cases
and contrast them with those identified for serotonin
syndrome.
Receptor agonism/antagonism cohorts: In order to identify their role with respect to the mechanisms underlying serotonin syndrome, the molecular targets perturbed
in both the serotonin syndrome and second-generation
antipsychotic cohorts were examined further. For each
target, the occurrence of serotonin syndrome was characterized in two cohorts—one when the target is inhibited (antagonism) and one when the target is induced
(agonism). These cohorts were defined by looking at
those cases that had the drugs associated with the
activity of interest reported. For a drug-target association to be considered, DrugBank was required to have
both the “actions” (such as “inhibitor” or “antagonist”)
and the “pharmacological action” annotations explicitly
determined.
The selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors cohort:
Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors have a known
association with serotonin syndrome. To compare selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor activity and serotonin syndrome statistical association with secondgeneration antipsychotics, cases were identified where
a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor was reported.

Clinical and Translational Science

The following drugs were considered: duloxetine,
nefazodone, desvenlafaxine, milnacipran, venlafaxine,
levomilnacipran, dapoxetine, indalpine, fluvoxamine,
citalopram, fluoxetine, paroxetine, sertraline, escitalopram, zimelidine, and etoperidone.

RESULTS
FAERS analysis of serotonin syndrome cases
First, a FAERS analysis was performed to create a mechanistic hypothesis for the association between serotonin syndrome and second-generation antipsychotics by using a
bioinformatics tool that makes connections between adverse
events and drugs, targets, and molecular pathways. A
total of 6,935 cases of serotonin syndrome were reported
to FAERS, and these cases were coreported with 892
total drugs, 816 disease indications, and 2,256 additional
reactions.
The most commonly reported adverse reactions along
with serotonin syndrome included drug interaction (N: 2,097,
PRR: 33.82), tremor (N: 869, PRR: 12.06), and hyperhidrosis (N: 747, PRR: 13.58). Tremor and hyperhidrosis are
commonly associated with serotonin syndrome and are in
accordance with symptoms on the Hunter Toxicity Criteria
Decision Rules and the Sternbach Criteria.12 Additionally,
drug interactions are frequently reported in serotonin syndrome cases; this finding agrees with a previous study
performed with the French pharmacovigilance database that
examined serotonin syndrome cases and found drug–drug
interactions primarily responsible for a large proportion of
cases.13

This list represents the top reported drugs given when a case of serotonin
syndrome is associated with a second-generation antipsychotic. From this list,
we identified that second-generation antipsychotics and serotonin syndrome
are often associated with another serotonergic drug. Total case count (N) is
1,140 reports.

Finally, cases of serotonin syndrome reported with secondgeneration antipsychotics were examined (Table 1). The
strongest statistical signals were seen for lurasidone (N: 21,
PRR: 8.71) and ziprasidone (N: 95, PRR: 6.27), while quetiapine had the most reports (N: 417, PRR: 5.23). An analysis
of concomitant medications in cases of serotonin syndrome
associated with second-generation antipsychotics revealed
several potential confounders, including many serotonergic
agents, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and
potential serotonin syndrome treatments, such as benzodiazepines (Table 2). Serotonin syndrome occurrence was
also found high within the overall second-generation antipsychotic cohort (N: 1,168, PRR: 4.79).

FAERS analysis of molecular targets
Targets potentially involved in serotonin syndrome mechanisms were identified by looking at the drug-target associations linked to the adverse events of the serotonin
syndrome cohort. Similarly, targets involved in secondgeneration antipsychotic adverse events were also examined; a second-generation antipsychotic cohort was defined
(consisting of AEs where at least one second-generation
antipsychotic was reported) and the targets perturbed by the
drugs in each case were analyzed.
Table 3 juxtaposes the 20 most frequent targets linked
to serotonin syndrome cases with the 20 most frequent targets linked to second-generation antipsychotic cases. Top
targets for second-generation antipsychotics and serotonin
syndrome included 5-HT1A , 5-HT2A , D2, and 5-HT2C . Of
these 20 individual targets, 11 targets overlapped between
serotonin syndrome and second-generation antipsychotics.
We hypothesized that one or more of these 11 targets
may be involved in the mechanisms associated with serotonin syndrome and second-generation antipsychotics, and
thus, these targets were selected for further computational
analysis.
The 11 overlapping targets in Table 3 were individually
analyzed to determine if agonism or antagonism of each target is primarily responsible for the serotonin syndrome signal.
Individual cohorts of each target’s agonists and antagonists
were analyzed for serotonin syndrome occurrence (Table 4).
The strongest signals were seen for 5-HT1A agonism, 5-HT1A
antagonism, 5-HT1B agonism, 5-HT2A antagonism, 5-HT2C
agonism, and alpha-2A antagonism. Based on this analysis,
we hypothesized that second-generation antipsychotics
could be associated with serotonin syndrome through at
least one of these mechanisms. These six target mechanisms were individually investigated for their associations
with second-generation antipsychotics and serotonin syndrome in peer-reviewed literature to determine if one or
more hypothesized mechanisms linked the two entities. This
literature analysis provided further support for two proposed
mechanisms: 5-HT1A agonism and 5-HT2A antagonism
(Figure 2).2,14
FAERS analysis of concomitant medications
The possibility of a drug–drug interaction or confounding
was also investigated by examining concomitant medications. Confounding may occur if the second-generation
antipsychotics are often seen in cases of serotonin syndrome
by chance, but it is truly another drug that is associated with
serotonin syndrome mechanistically. A drug–drug interaction
may occur if two drugs may independently be associated
with serotonin syndrome, but the risk of serotonin syndrome
increases when both drugs are taken together. Concomitant
medications were analyzed as described previously (Table 2),
and this analysis noted several serotonergic agents, particularly selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors were often
taken concomitantly with second-generation antipsychotics
in serotonin syndrome cases. Therefore, the significant
statistical signal noted in FAERS for second-generation
antipsychotics and serotonin syndrome may be attributable
to confounding or a drug–drug interaction. To determine
the relationship between second-generation antipsychotics,

second-generation antipsychotics and selective serotonin
reuptake inhibitors, the signal increased significantly compared with second-generation antipsychotics alone (N:
842, PRR: 13.89). These three cohorts indicate that cases
involving both selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and
second-generation antipsychotics are more disproportionally associated with serotonin syndrome compared with
cases involving second-generation antipsychotics alone.
This suggests a potential drug–drug interaction, as there is
a signal for serotonin syndrome when second-generation

antipsychotics are evaluated alone, but the disproportionality
score increases when second-generation antipsychotics and
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are given together.
Additionally, a cohort of selective serotonin reuptake
inhibitors without second-generation antipsychotics had
a weaker signal for serotonin syndrome (N: 4,390, PRR:
27.30) compared with the general selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, indicating that cases with second-generation
antipsychotics heavily contribute to the signal seen for selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. As before, this suggests a
drug–drug interaction, as the removal of second-generation
antipsychotics lowers the disproportionality score and suggests that the two drug classes increase each other’s risk for
serotonin syndrome. These fluctuations in signal strength in
the second-generation antipsychotic and selective serotonin
reuptake inhibitor cohorts indicate that second-generation
antipsychotics and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors
may act synergistically to induce serotonin syndrome.
Further analysis was performed with the literature, which
supported that pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic
interactions between second-generation antipsychotics and
other drugs, especially serotonergic agents, may increase
the risk for serotonin syndrome.15–18
DISCUSSION
This study identified drugs and the common receptors that
they target that are associated with serotonin syndrome and
examined potential mechanisms for the association between
serotonin syndrome and second-generation antipsychotics.
This analysis integrated FAERS data with molecular data
from other sources to produce hypotheses about the mechanisms that may explain the association between serotonin
syndrome and second-generation antipsychotics.

This table shows the cohorts created for selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and second-generation antipsychotics to analyze their relationships with serotonin
syndrome. Five cohorts were created for this query: second-generation antipsychotics, which includes all FAERS cases with second-generation antipsychotics,
second-generation antipsychotics without selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, which includes FAERS cases that include second-generation antipsychotics
but not selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, second-generation antipsychotics with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, which includes FAERS cases that
include both selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and second-generation antipsychotics, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors without second-generation
antipsychotics, which includes FAERS cases with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors but not second-generation antipsychotics, and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, which includes all FAERS cases with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. PRR CI: 95% confidence interval of the PRR score.

The FAERS analysis demonstrated that the function
of second-generation antipsychotic targets overlap with
receptor functions that are commonly associated with serotonin syndrome. Eleven targets of interest were identified
that overlapped between second-generation antipsychotics
and serotonin syndrome, which were further narrowed down
to six targets and activities of interest (agonism of 5-HT1A ,
5-HT1B , and 5-HT2C and antagonism of 5-HT1A , 5-HT2A , and
alpha-2A) based on their association with serotonin syndrome. Additionally, analysis of concomitant medications
with FAERS demonstrated a potentially synergistic effect
between second-generation antipsychotics and selective
serotonin reuptake inhibitors, as the disproportionality score
for serotonin syndrome was higher for second-generation
antipsychotics and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors
combined than for second-generation antipsychotics individually. Put together, analysis of the integrated FAERS
data alone generated two hypotheses: first, six targets and
activities of interest were hypothesized to be associated
with both second-generation antipsychotics and serotonin
syndrome, and second, concomitant administration of
additional serotonergic medications may increase the risk
of serotonin syndrome with second-generation antipsychotics. Further literature investigation supported these
hypotheses.
First, the six target mechanisms of interest that were identified with integrated FAERS data were further investigated
using peer-reviewed literature. This literature analysis provided further support for two proposed mechanisms: 5-HT2A
antagonism and 5-HT1A agonism. The literature supports that
second-generation antipsychotics are 5-HT2A antagonists.2
There is evidence that antagonism of 5-HT2A may cause
selective activation of 5-HT1A , which may in turn increase
the sensitivity of this receptor to serotonin.19–21 Additionally, data have shown that 5-HT2A antagonists enhance the
effects of a 5-HT1A agonist.22,23 Additionally, many secondgeneration antipsychotics have also been shown to be 5HT1A agonists14 5-HT1A agonism has been implicated in
increased serotonin levels and an increased risk for serotonin syndrome.24 These two mechanisms, in combination,
may increase serotonin levels, increase receptor sensitivity

to serotonin, or increase the effects of other drugs (such as
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors), potentially leading to
serotonin syndrome.
Second, based on our findings of potential interactions with concomitant medications, including serotonergic
medications, we additionally investigated the associations
between second-generation antipsychotics and metabolic
enzymes that may lead to drug–drug interactions using
the literature. Many second-generation antipsychotics are
metabolized via CYP3A4, CYP2D6, or CYP1A2 and are
substrates and inhibitors of P-glycoprotein.15–17 Many other
drugs also interact with these enzymes and transporters,
including several serotonergic agents.18 These interactions
could lead to increased concentrations of various drugs
or serotonin levels, which could be associated with serotonin syndrome. Finally, FAERS and literature case analyses
demonstrated that second-generation antipsychotics alone
can be associated with serotonin syndrome, but in most
reported cases serotonin syndrome occurs when secondgeneration antipsychotics are given with other serotonergic
agents.20,25,26
This analysis combines FAERS data with several other
data sources to connect drugs, adverse events, and targets, among many other entities. In this analysis, FAERS
data were used for hypothesis generation. These data and
the signals generated are used regularly at the FDA to
evaluate safety concerns, and the large amount of data (over
8 million reports) contained in public FAERS from healthcare professionals, consumers, and manufacturers includes
valuable information. FAERS and similar postmarket reporting databases have previously been used successfully for
adverse event analysis.27–29 However, FAERS also has limitations, including confounded cases, reporting biases, and
a lack of confirmation that the case even occurred. For
example, serotonin syndrome could be miscoded in FAERS
as neuroleptic malignant syndrome, or vice versa. These
limitations can all affect the statistics calculated from FAERS.
FAERS should not be used to infer causality. Thus, FAERS
may be used for hypothesis generation, but identified signals
should be further investigated for confirmation, as performed
here.

Association Between Serotonin Syndrome and Second Generation
Antipsychotics via Pharmacological Target-Adverse Event Analysis
Racz et al.

Future work includes the integration of a systems biology
approach to further examine targets, proteins, and genes
that may be associated with a variety of adverse events and
drugs. Additionally, off-target prediction is under investigation for routine integration into this methodology to evaluate
secondary or off-target effects that may be responsible for
adverse events. Similar methodologies have previously been
successfully employed to analyze adverse events.30,31
This study demonstrated that informatics tools and analyses can quickly identify drugs, targets, drug–drug interactions, and mechanisms that may be associated with adverse
events. Computational analysis performed with FAERS and
supporting pharmacokinetic data from the literature and
case studies show that second-generation antipsychotics
are associated with serotonin syndrome. Further research
should be performed to elucidate the mechanism of 5HT2A /5-HT1A interaction and serotonin levels after administration of second-generation antipsychotics to better clarify the risk of serotonin syndrome with second-generation
antipsychotics. Additionally, drug–drug interaction studies
may explain the magnitude of increased risk for serotonin
syndrome when second-generation antipsychotics are taken
concomitantly with other serotonergic drugs. Confirmation of
these mechanisms may impact patient treatment and result
in new combinations of drugs, lower dosages of drug regimens, or increased patient monitoring to reduce the risk of
serotonin syndrome.
