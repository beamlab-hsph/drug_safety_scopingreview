ABSTRACT
Objective: The objective of the study was to identify possible toxic signal induced by cyclophosphamide treatment by
searching database from Canadian Adverse Reaction Monitoring Program (CADRMP). Methods: A total of 10429 reports
of patients between January 1970 to March 2010 were downloaded from CADRMP website. These reports contained
information of adverse events associated with all other drugs inclusive of cyclophosphamide . Adverse drug reaction (ADR)
signal detection were determined by proportional reporting ratio (PRR), reporting odds ratio (ROR), PRR calculated by chisquare statistics, 95% confidence interval of PRR, observed to expected (O/E) ratio and De Mouchel method calculated
PRR. Information component (IC) was given by Bayesian confidence propagation neural network. (As per regulatory criteria,
PRR ≥ 2, ROR ≥ 1, chi-square statistics calculated PRR ≥ 4 and lower bound of 95% CI of PRR ≥ 1 to consider particular
adverse drug reaction as a signal. Further by BCPNN method, if IC−2SD≤0 then that drug-ADR pair considered as no
signal; if 0<IC−2SD ≤ 1.5, then that drug-ADR pair considered as weak signal; if 1.5<IC−2SD ≤ 3.0, then that drug-ADR
pair considered as middle signal; if IC−2SD > 3.0, then that drug-ADR pair considered as strong signal). Results: A total
of 108 reports of cyclophosphamide-induced neutropenia were reported in CADRMP database. The PRR was found to be
4.7396 and by the Du Mouchel method it was 3.9310. Further, the PRR calculated by chi-square statistics was 236.02518.
The lower and upper limits of 95% CI of PRR was found to be 1.3484 and 1.7634, respectively. The O/E ratio was found
to be 3.9322 and ROR was found to be 4.9704. The value of PRR ≥ 2, ROR ≥ 1, chi-square statistics calculated PRR ≥ 4
and lower limit of 95% CI of PRR ≥ 1 indicates signal for neutropenia caused by cyclophosphamide. The value of IC-2SD
was 1.6852 indicates middle signal for cyclophosphamide-induced neutropenia. The signal of neutropenia coupled with
cyclophosphamide was found potent enough to cause neutropenia in Canadian population.
Key words: Bayesian confidence propagation neural network, Cyclophosphamide, Neutropenia, Proportional reporting
ratio, Signal detection.

develops. In the currently used automated systems, the
computer selects drug-adverse event pairs that stand
out against the background of the database, according
prefixed statistical criteria, for example, using proportional
reporting ratio (PRR) or, as is the case at the UMC, the
information component (IC) calculated by a Bayesian
Confidence Propagation Neural Network (BCPNN).
Once the computer has at a given moment identified the
associations that meet the quantitative criterion, individual
assessors have to select those associations that deserve

Graphical Abstract

further preliminary attention. From now on the human
mind has to decide whether the association is likely or not
to represent a true signal and needs further examination.1
Cyclophosphamide is an inactive pro-drug that requires
enzymatic and chemical activation; the resultant nitrogen
mustard produces the interstrand and intrastrand DNA
cross links that account for its cytotoxic properties. The
major mechanism of cyclophosphamide detoxification
involves aldehyde dehydrogenase; cells with high
proliferative potential express high levels of aldehyde
dehydrogenase and as a consequence are relatively resistant
to cyclophosphamide. Cyclophosphamide, in combination
with other antineoplastic agents, is used for the treatment
of various cancers, including breast, lymphoid and pediatric
malignancies. Cyclophosphamide is also widely used in bone
marrow transplantation ‘conditioning’ and ’mobilization’
regimens, and for the treatment of different autoimmune
conditions. The toxic effects of cyclophosphamide include
bone marrow suppression, cardiac and gonadal toxicity,
hemorrhagic cystitis and carcinogenesis, with cumulative
dose being the principal risk factor.2
Bone marrow suppression is the most common toxic effect
of cyclophosphamide. Neutropenia is dose dependent.
Patients treated with low dose cyclophosphamide should
be monitored closely, although they rarely develop
significant neutropenia. Leukopenia, thrombocytopenia
and anemia are common after high dose cyclophosphamide
administration.2 Rapid hematologic recovery invariably
occurs within 2–3 weeks in patients with normal bone
marrow reserve; regardless of the dose.2 The objective of
342

the study was to identify possible toxic signal detection (SD)
of cyclophosphamide by searching database from Canadian
Adverse Reaction Monitoring Program (CADRMP).

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Data collection from public database
The CADRMP is the Health Canada post-marketing
surveillance program which collects and assesses suspected
adverse reaction reports for Canadian marketed health
products such as cyclophosphamide. Data was extracted
from Canadian Adverse Drug Reaction Monitoring
Program. For extraction following sections were serially
accessed from health Canada website (http://www.hc-sc.
gc.ca/index-eng.php).3 In the section of Canada vigilance
program, the CADRMP online database was extracted.
Procedure followed for signal detection
Individual Case Safety Reports (ICSRs) in this database
were collected from the official website of Health
Canada. The text freely available was converted into a
structured format. In the structured format, statistical
methods were applied to calculate an actual measure of
signals. Therapeutic class-specific SD calculations were
then carried out as shown in Figure 1. For analysis of
detection of signals by different methods are reported.
These methods of calculations were selected following a
systematic literature review.4-6 In the present study, attempt
was made to maintain the originality of data collected from
CADRMP database while computing actual SD.

Calculation of signal detection
Disproportionality
These are the frequency or relative frequency of a
particular drug–event pair. The signal would be considered
significant if the statistics from different calculations such
as Proportional Reporting Ratio (PRR), Reporting Odds
Ratio (ROR), PRR calculated by chi-square statistics, the
95% confidence interval for PRR (lower limit and upper
limit), the observed-to-expected (O/E ratio) and DuMouchel method calculated PRR exceeded a certain value
((As per regulatory criteria, PRR ≥ 2, ROR ≥ 1, chi-square
statistics calculated PRR ≥ 4 and lower bound limit of 95%
CI of PRR ≥ 1 to consider particular adverse drug reaction
as a signal. Further by BCPNN method, if IC−2SD ≤ 0
then that drug-ADR pair considered as no signal; if 0 <
IC−2SD ≤ 1.5, then that drug-ADR pair considered as
weak signal; if 1.5 < IC−2SD ≤ 3.0, then that drug-ADR
pair considered as middle signal; if IC − 2SD > 3.0, then
that drug-ADR pair considered as strong signal), then the
signal would be considered significant.5
PRR calculation
As shown in Table 1 and 2, a 2*2 contingency table
was prepared to capture the incidences of neutropenia
(targeted event Y) and all other events for the targeted
drug X, i.e., cyclphosphamide, and all other drugs in
the database to calculate PRR.4 After that, the PRR was
calculated as follows:

a=Targeted event (Y) associated with targeted drug

ROR calculation
The procedure followed to calculate ROR was similar to
that of the PRR method.4 The same contingency table
(Table 1 and 2) prepared for PRR, was also followed in
the case of ROR calculations. The ROR was calculated
as follows:

a=Targeted event (Y) associated with targeted drug
b=Other adverse drug reactions (ADRs) associated with
targeted drug
c=Targeted event (Y) associated with other than targeted
drug
d=Other adverse drug reactions (ADRs) with other than

The Chi-square (c2) statistics calculated PRR
The chi-square statistics was applied to test the independence
of categorical variables.6 c2 was used as an alternative
measure of heterogeneity in the contingency table which
built with the medicinal product X and the adverse event
Y. PRR calculated by chi-square statistics was calculated
as follows:

b=Other adverse drug reactions (ADRs) associated with
targeted drug

95% confidence interval of the PRR calculation
The standard error of the natural logarithm of the PRR
was estimated based on the following formula:

D=Other adverse drug reactions (ADRs) with other than
targeted drug

A=Targeted event (Y) associated with targeted drug

Signal Detection by Bayesian Confidence Propagation Neural
Network (BCPNN)
BCPNN has been chosen for ADR signal detection, which
realized through calculating the information components
(IC) compared the calculating IC value with the BCPNN
corresponding evaluation standard of signal detection
to judge if the signal established or not.7 The specific
algorithm of BCPNN as follows:

B=Targeted event (Y) associated with other than targeted
drug
C=Targeted event (Y) and Other adverse drug reactions
(ADRs) associated with targeted drug
D=Targeted event (Y) and Other adverse drug reactions
(ADRs) associated with other than targeted drug

N=Total sum of adverse drug reactions associated with
drug and other than targeted drug

The 95% CI for ln (PRR) was then estimated as ln (PRR)
± 1.96SE, and its exponential was taken.7 Lower and upper
limits of 95% CI for PRR = {PRR/exp (1.96SE), PRR /
exp (1.96SE)}6
The observed-to-expected (O/E) ratio calculation8
The O/E was calculated as follows:

A=Targeted event (Y) associated with targeted drug
B=Other adverse drug reactions (ADRs) associated with
targeted drug
C=Targeted event (Y) associated with other than targeted
drug
D=Other adverse drug reactions (ADRs) with other than

Du Mouchel Method for PRR calculation
This method was based on 2*2 contingency table values as
well as the ratio of values of A and expected A was taken
into consideration for calculations. The PRR as per Du
Mouchel Method was calculated as per below equation:

The relevant details for calculation of PRR and ROR are
mentioned in Table 1 and 2. The signal detected with the
help of “proportional reporting ratio” for neutropenia
associated with cyclophosphamide was found to be 4.7396
and “reporting odds ratio” for neutropenia associated with
cyclophosphamide was found to be 4.9704. However, the
PRR with the help of the Du Mouchel Method was found
to be 3.9310. As per above results, the value of PRR was
≥ 2 and value of ROR was ≥ 1 indicate toxic signal for
neutropenia associated with cyclophosphamide.
Chi-square statistics calculated PRR
The relevant details for calculation of Chi-square
statistics calculated PRR is mentioned in Table 3. The
chi-square statistics calculated PRR was 236.02518. The
value of chi-square statistics calculated PRR was ≥ 4 for
cyclophosphamide which also indicates toxic signal for
neutropenia associated with cyclophosphamide.
95% Confidence interval for PRR
The lower limit of 95% Confidence Interval of PRR was
found to be 1.3484 and Upper limit was found to be 1.7634.
95% Confidence interval of PRR has been computed as
per mentioned below steps:

Data by gender and age
The data obtained from CADRMP were stratified by years
(Figure 2), age (Figure 3) and gender (Table 4). Highest
numbers of neutropenia were reported between 2001 to
2005. Females were more prone to neutropenia associated
with cyclophosphamide as high as 60.28% as compared
to 35.53% of males. Also, when stratified on the basis of
age group it clearly indicated that neutropenia associated
with cyclophosphamide prevalence was high in age group
of; 19-60 years with 51.90%; while 30.14% in 60-108 years
and 7.19% in 0-18 years age group.
Signal Detection by Bayesian Confidence Propagation Neural

DISCUSSION
The thalidomide disaster in the early 1960s prompted drug
authorities to develop systems for detection of unknown
side effects and risks of drugs. Spontaneous reporting
systems have since been established in more than 100
countries. Signal detection in spontaneous reporting
databases has proven to be a simple and cost effective tool

to assemble and analyzed information from different
sources to detect and act on new safety signals. The
original signal detection method of case-by-case
assessment of spontaneous reports of adverse drug
reactions (ADR) is effective, but resource consuming,
especially in large ADR databases with high volumes of
incoming reports.9

for identifying suspected new adverse drug reactions. Some
of the better known examples of safety signals detected
include apart from phocomelia from thalidomide during
pregnancy, vaginal clear cell cancer in girls of mothers using
diethylstilbestrol during pregnancy, suicidal ideation and
suicide induced by the anti-obesity drug rimonabant and
the latest example; narcolepsy in relation to the pandemic
vaccine Pandemrix.9

CONCLUSION

The spontaneous reporting systems differ by country
regarding accepted reporters (e.g., physicians, pharmacists,
consumers) and the managing of the systems (national
authorities, university based or independent institutions).
A few standardized terminologies for coding adverse
events and drugs are applied, which lend the opportunity

This has led to the development and acceptance of semiautomated signal detection methods, including primary
step(s) of detection by statistical Disproportionality
analysis, followed by manual clinical validation. Several
statistical methods are currently in use.7-10 but no gold
standard has been established.10-11 The methods have the
ability to detect new safety signals for drugs years earlier
than traditional manual methods.12-13 Strengths, limitations
and differences between different pharmacovigilance signal
detection methods including their initial disproportionality
part have been analyzed and described previously (CIOMS
2010). Within the European Union (EU) signal detection
is continuously performed in the common ADR database
EudraVigilance (EV, EV2013) using the Proportional
Reporting Ratio (PRR) method.9,10,14-16
The values of PRR (4.73), ROR (4.97), PRR calculated by
chi-square statistics (236.02), 95% confidence interval of
PRR (1.34 & 1.76), O/E ratio (3.93), PRR by Du-Mouchel
method (3.93) suggest toxic signal for neutropenia. Further,
the value of IC-2SD value was 1.68 for cyclophosphamide
which also suggest middle intensity for neutropenia
associated with cyclophosphamide.

The therapeutic class specific signal of neutropenia coupled
with cyclophosphamide was found potent enough to cause
neutropenia.
