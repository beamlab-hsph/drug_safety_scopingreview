Spontaneous adverse event reports have a high potential for detecting adverse drug reactions. However,
due to their dimension, the analysis of such databases requires statistical methods. In this context,
disproportionality measures can be used. Their main idea is to project the data onto contingency tables in
order to measure the strength of associations between drugs and adverse events. However, due to the data
projection, these methods are sensitive to the problem of coprescriptions and masking effects. Recently,
logistic regressions have been used with a Lasso type penalty to perform the detection of associations
between drugs and adverse events. On different examples, this approach limits the drawbacks of the
disproportionality methods, but the choice of the penalty value is open to criticism while it strongly
influences the results. In this paper, we propose to use a logistic regression whose sparsity is viewed as
a model selection challenge. Since the model space is huge, a Metropolis–Hastings algorithm carries
out the model selection by maximizing the BIC criterion. Thus, we avoid the calibration of penalty or
threshold. During our application on the French pharmacovigilance database, the proposed method
is compared to well-established approaches on a reference dataset, and obtains better rates of positive
and negative controls. However, many signals (i.e., specific drug–event associations) are not detected by
the proposed method. So, we conclude that this method should be used in parallel to existing measures
in pharmacovigilance.

1 Introduction
To obtain approval, drugs go through many premarket safety tests, but adverse drug reactions may not
be detected during these experiments. Many national or international regulatory agencies have thus
introduced pharmacovigilance systems collecting spontaneously reported adverse events. Postapproval
drug safety surveillance relies on these reported cases for suspecting that some drugs induce adverse
events. They provide huge binary databases that describe each individual by its drug consumption
and its adverse events. Although spontaneous reporting systems suffer from many biases (Almenoff
et al., 2007), they have permitted early identification of associations between drugs and adverse events
(Szarfman et al., 2002). In order to assist pharmacovigilance experts in managing such databases,

statistical methods aiming to put the light on unexpected associations have been proposed. This is
referred to as signal detection where detected signals warrant further investigation.
The most classical methods are based on disproportionality measures and use data projections onto
contingency tables. Among them, the most popular are: the Proportional Reporting Ratio (Evans et al.,
2001), the Reporting Odds Ratio (Van Puijenbroek et al., 2002), the Bayesian Confidence Propagation
Neural Network (Bate et al., 1998), and the Gamma Poisson Shrinkage (DuMouchel, 1999). All
of these methods use a specific statistic that requires a threshold for detecting associations between
drugs and adverse events. The disproportionality measure is computed for each drug–event pair in the
database and compared to the threshold. Moreover, the data projections onto the contingency tables
provide good computational performances. However, these projections involve some weakness against
the problems of coprescriptions and masking effects from highly reported associations for some drugs
(Caster et al., 2010). None of these methods is defined as the reference approach. Due to the shortage
of the gold standard sets, their comparison remains a challenging issue.
The shrinkage logistic regression is an interesting alternative to the methods based on data projections
onto contingency tables. In this spirit, Caster et al. (2010) propose to model the probability of an
adverse event conditionally on the drug consumptions by a sparse logistic regression whose sparsity
is imposed by a Lasso type penalty (Tibshirani, 1996). In this context, drug j and adverse event h
are claimed to be associated and to constitute a signal when the coefficient related to drug j in the
regression of adverse event h is strictly positive — since, in this case, the adverse event occurs more
often with the consumption of this drug. However, the choice of the penalty value is a crucial and very
difficult task. Indeed, the penalty value directly influences the signal detection. Caster et al. (2010)
propose to use the same penalty for all the regressions. Moreover, they set the penalty value in order
to obtain the same number of signals as a disproportionality method. A more rigorous method, but
more computationally demanding, could consist in setting the penalty value by cross-validation where
the penalty is set for minimizing the misclassification error. However, as shown during our numerical
application, this approach obtains poor results notably due to the database sparsity. Recently, Harpaz
et al. (2013) have used a full logistic regression in a two-step procedure where the first step consists in
empirically selecting a subset of candidate drugs.
In this paper, the signal detection is performed by a model selection step that avoids the use of any
threshold or the calibration of the penalty. In this context, a model of a logistic regression determines
the coefficients that are not zero. In a Bayesian framework, the best model has the highest posterior
probability but this amount is not explicit. It is also useful to approximate its logarithm by the
Bayesian Information Criterion (Schwarz, 1978). Therefore, the signal detection consists in selecting
the model that maximizes the BIC criterion. Unfortunately, the number of competing models is too
huge for applying an exhaustive approach that computes the BIC criterion for each competing model.
Therefore, the model selection is carried out by a Metropolis–Hastings algorithm (Robert and Casella,
2004) that performs a random walk through the models of interest. This algorithm is classically used
for finding the maximum of a function even on a discrete space. In our context, the mode of its
stationary distribution corresponds to the model maximizing the BIC criterion. Thus, we were able to
develop an efficient algorithm by taking advantage of some features of the data.
In this paper, we compare our model-based procedure to the four disproportionality methods
implemented in the R package PhViD and to the Lasso logistic regression implemented in the R package
glmnet. We use the database arisen from the French pharmacovigilance that received roughly 20,000
suspected adverse drug reactions per year from 2000 to 2010. Comparison between pharmacovigilance
procedures is a difficult task. In this paper, we focus on the four adverse events described in the
Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) reference set (Ryan et al., 2013) and on their
145 relating drugs. To our knowledge, it is the only reference set recently formed with positive and
negative controls to address the issue of methods assessment in pharmacovigilance.
This article is organised as follows. Section 2 presents the parsimonious version of the logistic
regression. Section 3 introduces the Metropolis–Hastings algorithm devoted to the model selection.

Section 4 compares the proposed method to four disproportionality methods and to the Lasso logistic
regression. Section 5 discusses the limitations and scope of the proposed approach.

2 Parsimonious logistic regression
2.1

Spontaneous reporting database

Spontaneous reporting databases describe n individuals by their consumptions of p drugs and by
the presence or absence of d adverse events. For the purpose of logistic regression, in this article,
we consider one adverse event at a time that we denote by the binary vector y = (y1 , . . . , yn ) ∈ Bn
where B = {0, 1}. More specifically, yi = 1 if individual i suffers from this adverse event and yi = 0
otherwise. In the regression context, explanatory variables x = (x1 , . . . , xn ) indicate the presence or the
absence of drug consumptions. Binary vector xi = (xi1 , . . . , xip ) ∈ B p indicates the drug consumption
of individual i since xi j = 1 if individual i takes drug j and xi j = 0 otherwise.
2.2

Logistic regression

The probability of the adverse event given the drug consumption is assumed to follow a logit regression.
Model γ = (γ1 , . . . , γ p ) ∈ B p defines which drugs influence the appearance of the adverse event, since
γ j = 1 if the coefficient of the regression related to drug j is unconstrained (i.e., defined on R) while
γ j = 0 if this coefficient is zero. The indices of the drugs having a nonzero (respectively zero) coefficient
are grouped into the set Dγ = { j : γ j = 1} (respectively Dγc = { j : γ j = 0}).
For model γ, the logit relationship is

P(yi = 1 | xi , γ, β)
= β0 +
ln
β j xi j ,
(1)
1 − P(yi = 1 | xi , γ, β)
j∈D
γ



β = β0 , β1 , . . . , β p ∈ γ being the vector of regression coefficients for which many coefficients are
constrained by γ to be zero, since


γ = β ∈ R p+1 : ∀ j ∈ Dγc , β j = 0 .
(2)
Thus, the drugs suspected to induce the adverse event are those belonging to Dγ and having a positive
coefficient in the regression (i.e., β j > 0). Thus, we call signal each pair adverse-event/drug where the
coefficient related to the drug in the regression of the adverse event is strictly positive.
Assuming that spontaneous reports consists of n i.i.d. observations, the adverse event log-likelihood
related to model γ is written as
⎛

⎡

j∈Dγ

Obviously, the indices of xi impacting the log-likelihood value are those belonging to Dγ . In practice,
it is often more numerically efficient to compute the adverse event log-likelihood by using the unique
profiles of observations impacting the likelihood. This weighted form of the log-likelihood is described
in Appendix A.
From the database, the Maximum Likelihood Estimate (MLE) 

To assess (4), we need to solve the derivative likelihood equations using the classical Newton–Raphson
method (see Nocedal and Wright, 2006). However, the MLE is well defined only if the overlapping

conditions of Silvapulle (1981) are satisfied (see also the discussion of Owen and Roediger, 2014).
Thus, for the binary variables, the MLE is well defined only if
∀(hy , hx ) ∈ B2 , ∀ j ∈ Dγ , ∃i ∈ Ih : xi j = hx ,

y

where Ih = {i : yi = hy }. In a few words, (5) is equivalent to have at least one absence and one presence
y
of drug consumption in both sets {xi j | yi = 0} and {xi j | yi = 1}. To ensure that the MLE is well
defined, this condition suggests not take into account drugs that do not satisfy it.

3 Model selection by MCMC algorithm

We define the set of the competing models  as the set of models γ ∈ B p where (5) is satisfied. So,

framework, the aim is to obtain the model having the highest posterior distribution
 In a Bayesian

p γ | y, x . We assume that uniformity holds for the prior distribution p(γ | x) of models γ ∈ . So,
we have


p γ | y, x ∝ p(y | x, γ ),
(7)
where p(y | x, γ ) is the integrated likelihood defined by

p(y | x, γ, β)p(β | x, γ )dβ,
p(y | x, γ ) =


where p(y | x, γ, β) = exp n (y | x, γ, β) is the likelihood related to model γ and where p(β | x, γ ) is
the prior distribution of β whose the support is included in γ . Since logarithm is monotone,


(9)
arg max γ∈ p γ | y, x = arg max γ∈ ln p(y | x, γ ).
When the integrated likelihood has not a closed form, the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) is
generally used. It is based on a second degree Laplace approximation of the logarithm of the integrated
likelihood (Schwarz, 1978), and it is defined as

 νγ
ln n,
(10)
βγ −
BIC(γ ) = n y | x, γ, 


where νγ = 1 + pj=1 γ j denotes the degree of freedom for model γ. Therefore, we want to achieve γ 
that is the model maximizing the BIC criterion, so
γ  = arg max γ∈ BIC(γ ).

(11)

This criterion selects the model providing the best trade-off between its accuracy related to the data
and its complexity.
Obviously, the number of competing models is too huge for applying an exhaustive approach (i.e., to
compute the BIC criterion for each model). Therefore, the Metropolis–Hastings algorithm described
in the following section is used to estimate γ  .
3.2

Metropolis-Hastings algorithm for achieving γ 

Model γ  can be achieved through a Metropolis–Hastings algorithm (Robert and Casella, 2004),
described in Algorithm 1, which performs
a random walk over . The unique invariant distribution of

Algorithm 1 is proportional to exp BIC(γ ) . Therefore, γ  is the mode of its stationary distribution.

At each iteration, the algorithm proposes to move into a neighborhood of the current model. A
neighboring model is defined as copy of the current model where just a few elements are altered. Thus,
at iteration [r], the candidate γ̃ is equal to the current model γ [r] except for α ≥ 1 elements at the
maximum. More specifically, γ̃ is uniformly sampled in Vα (γ [r] ) where

Note that we define that BIC(γ ) = −∞ for all γ ∈ B p \ . Thus, the probability ρ [r] is an approximation
of the Bayes factor (Kass and Raftery, 1995) between model γ̃ and model γ [r] . This algorithm performs
R iterations and returns the model maximizing the BIC criterion. In practice, there may be almost
absorbing states, so different initialisations of this algorithm ensure to visit γ  .

4 Results on real data set
In this section, after presenting the French pharmacovigilance database, the proposed method is
compared to the others by using the OMOP set. Finally, specific comments are given for the proposed
method.
4.1

Data

To evaluate and compare the performances of the competing methods, we use the OMOP (Ryan et al.,
2013) reference set of test cases that contains both positive and negative controls. Four adverse events
(i.e., d = 4) were studied in this reference set: acute myocardial infarction (AMI), acute kidney injury
(AKI), acute liver injury (ALI), and upper gastro-intestinal bleeding (GIB). There are three-hundred
and ninety-nine test cases where 165 positive controls and 234 negative controls were identified across
the four adverse events of interest. More details are given by Table 1. Ryan et al. (2013) indicate that the
majority of positive controls for AKI and GIB were supported by randomized clinical trial evidence,
while the majority of positive controls for ALI and AMI were only based on published case reports.

Then a positive control is a pair (drug and adverse event) that is supported by randomized clinical
trial evidence or based on published case reports whereas a negative control is not met by neither of
these methods.
Methods are compared on the data extracted from the French pharmacovigilance database where
notifications have been collected from 2000 to 2010. The studied database describes a set of n = 219,340
individuals with their adverse event notifications and their drug consumption informations concerning
p = 145 drugs mentioned on the OMOP reference set. Each individual is described by the pair (xi , yi )
detailed in Section 2.1. Therefore, 145 × 4 = 580 drug–event pairs are studied, among them 145 are
positive controls (25%), 153 are negative controls (26%) and 282 have an unknown status (49%). More
details are given in Table 2. The four studied adverse events occur 495 (AMI), 4746 (GIB), 10910
(ALI), and 5234 (AKI) times in the French pharmacovigilance database.
4.2

Competing methods

Disproportionality-based methods We chose to compare our method with all the disproportionality methods implemented in the R package PhViD (Ahmed and Poncet, 2013) Thus, four
disproportionality-based methods: the Proportional Reporting Ratio (PRR), the Reporting Odds
Ratio (ROR), the Reporting Fisher Exact Test (RFET) (Ahmed et al., 2010), and the FDR-based
Gamma Poisson Shrinkage (GPS) (Ahmed et al., 2009) are considered. The specific statistics are used
with a threshold of 0.05 and are presented in Table 3. All methods are compared on the 580 drug–event
pairs mentioned on the OMOP reference set.
Lasso-based logistic regressions The results of the Lasso method applied on logistic regressions
are obtained with the R package glmnet (Friedman et al., 2010). The penalty value is selected by
cross-validation with tenfolds to obtain the most parsimonious model among the models having best
misclassification error. This method permits to find few signals since the selected penalty implies that
only the intercept is not zero for all adverse events except one adverse event (AMI). This example
shows the difficulty for calibrating the Lasso-penalty. Indeed, the misclassification error is roughly
constant according to the penalty value. This is due to the weak rate of notifications for one adverse
event.

Model-based logistic regressions For each of the four adverse events, 100 random initialisations of
Algorithm 1 with α = 5 and R = 5.103 iterations have been done. The model maximizing the BIC
criterion is returned. Table 4 presents the number of competing models for each adverse event, which
corresponds to the dimension of  defined in (6).
4.3

Method comparison

Table 5 presents the rates of positive controls, of negative controls and of unknown signals detected
by all the competing methods.
The proposed method obtains the best rates of positive controls and negative controls. It detects 70
signals while the Lasso-based method finds only 13 couples. The poor results of the Lasso are explained
by the penalty values assessed by the misclassification error rate. Indeed, the resulting penalty values
constrain all the coefficients to be zero for three adverse events. All the disproportionality methods
obtain similar results. Despite that many signals are detected by these methods (between 73 and 129),
their rates of positive and negative controls are worse than those resulting from the proposed method.

Since the proposed method obtains the best rates of positive and negative controls, we conclude that
it is more precise for the signal detection. However, it finds less signals than the disproportionality
methods. So, it permits the practitioner to focus on more probably related drug–event pairs. Moreover,
some associations detected only by the disproportionality method could be due to the coprescription
phenomenon, whereby a drug tends to be coprescribed and therefore coreported with an other drug.
Caster et al. (2010) explored this phenomenon and found that the adjustment for coreported drugs in
the regression often explains why signals are highlighted only by disproportionality methods.
4.4

Specific comments about the proposed method

Table 6 indicates the computing time obtained by an Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU 3.00 GHz and the number
of times where the Algorithm 1 finds the best model.
The computing time has been strongly reduced by using the expression of the log-likelihood given
in Appendix A. For example, by considering the best model resulting of the adverse event AMI where
nine variables have a nonzero coefficient, the database can be reduced to mγ  = 45 unique weighted
individuals (see Appendix A). Moreover, since many different initializations allow to find γ  , the
number of initializations (set at 100 during the experiment) could be reduced. Finally, the list of the
detected signals are presented in Appendix B.
4.5

Specific comments about the Lasso

We have seen that the Lasso obtains poor results when the penalty is determined according to the
misclassification error. Caster et al. (2010) set the same penalty value for all the adverse events.
Moreover, they use a disproportionality measure to evaluate the number of signals and thus to deduce
the penalty value corresponding to the same number of signals.
In order to investigate the Lasso approach features, we build a sequence of penalties to obtain
different numbers of signals with the Lasso. The numbers of positive and negative controls resulting
for each penalty values are indicated by the black lines of Fig. 1. The results related to the model
maximizing the BIC criterion are indicated by red dots.
Figure 1 shows that for a penalty providing more than 70 signals (number of signals detected by the
proposed procedure), the number of negative controls resulting form the Lasso procedure increases
quickly. For the penalty providing 70 signals, the results obtained by the Lasso procedure are slightly
better to those of the proposed procedure. However, in practice, it is not doable to use these plots for
calibrating the Lasso penalty, since the nature of signals is unknown.

This illustrates the difficulty and influence of penalty calibration. This is avoided by the proposed
procedure that detects signals by maximizing BIC.

5 Discussion
In this paper, we have proposed a method for analysing individual spontaneous reporting databases
that also avoids the drawbacks of the disproportionality-based measures (coprescription and masking
effects, Caster et al., 2010). The signal detection is led throughout parsimonious logistic regressions
whose sparsity degree is assessed as a model selection challenge. Therefore, we avoid the use of Lassotype method that requires the challenging calibration of penalty. The combinatorial problem of model
selection is bypassed by Metropolis–Hastings binary space sampling.
Despite to the difficulties for evaluating pharmacovigilance methods, the OMOP reference set of
Ryan et al. (2013) gives us the opportunity to compare the proposed method to the reference approaches
on real data. On these data, it appears to be relevant for the signal detection issue. Although the better
accuracy of signal detection is provided by the proposed method, some signals are not detected by
our method. Note that some positive controls are not detected by any methods due to their very few
number of notifications (e.g., couples C09AA05/ALI or L04AB02/ALI). Moreover, some positive
controls that are not detected by our method are detected by another method. Therefore, we advice
the pharmacovigilance experts to focus on the signals detected by our method. In a second time, a
complementary study could be based on the signals detected by other methods.

that the dimension of the model space is defined by the number of drugs verifying (5). Figure 2 presents
the evolution of this number according to the headcount of the adverse events.
In the whole database, 75% of the adverse events can be associated to less than 42 drugs. For the
adverse events that have less than 12 drugs verifying (5), we advise to use an exhaustive approach
consisting of computing the BIC criterion for each competing models in . The model selection on the
whole French pharmacovigilance database is achieved at the cost of several days of computing time.
The proposed approach can thus be used to investigate targeted adverse events. Finally, a preliminary
drug selection could provide a reducing of computing time.
Acknowledgment The authors are grateful to Ismaı̈l Ahmed for his useful advices and Francesco Salvo for data

Appendix A: Weighted form of the adverse event log-likelihood
Obviously, the coordinates of xi impacting the log-likelihood value are those belonging to Dγ . For

each observation xi , we denote by xγi ∈ B|γ| , where |γ| = pj=1 γ j , the vector containing the elements
of xi impacting the log-likelihood (i.e., the vector composed with the elements of xi such as index
belongs to Dγ ). Thus, for each j = 1, . . . , |γ|:

Moreover, many individual profiles (xγi , yi ) occur many times in the database. We denote by mγ
the number of different profiles impacting the log-likelihood of model γ. The profile i is denoted by
(x̃γi , ỹγi ) and its weight is denoted by wγi . Thus, (3) is given by
⎛

In practice, it is often more numerically efficient to compute the adverse event log-likelihood by
using (A2) than by using (3).
