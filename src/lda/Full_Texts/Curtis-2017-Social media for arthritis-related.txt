Abstract
Background: Social media may complement traditional data sources to answer comparative effectiveness/safety
questions after medication licensure.
Methods: The Treato platform was used to analyze all publicly available social media data including Facebook,
blogs, and discussion boards for posts mentioning inflammatory arthritis (e.g. rheumatoid, psoriatic). Safety events
were self-reported by patients and mapped to medical ontologies, resolving synonyms. Disease and symptomrelated treatment indications were manually redacted. The units of analysis were unique terms in posts. Prespecified conditions (e.g. herpes zoster (HZ)) were selected based upon safety signals from clinical trials and
reported as pairwise odds ratios (ORs); drugs were compared with Fisher’s exact test. Empirically identified events
were analyzed using disproportionality analysis and reported as relative reporting ratios (RRRs). The accuracy of a
natural language processing (NLP) classifier to identify cases of shingles associated with arthritis medications was
assessed.
Results: As of October 2015, there were 785,656 arthritis-related posts. Posts were predominantly US posts (75%)
from patient authors (87%) under 40 years of age (61%). For HZ posts (n = 1815), ORs were significantly increased
with tofacitinib versus other rheumatoid arthritis therapies. ORs for mentions of perforated bowel (n = 13) were
higher with tocilizumab versus other therapies. RRRs associated with tofacitinib were highest in conditions related
to baldness and hair regrowth, infections and cancer. The NLP classifier had a positive predictive value of 91% to
identify HZ. There was a threefold increase in posts following television direct-to-consumer advertisement (p = 0.04);
posts expressing medication safety concerns were significantly more frequent than favorable posts.
Conclusion: Social media is a challenging yet promising data source that may complement traditional approaches
for comparative effectiveness research for new medications.

Background
Social media is a burgeoning form of communication
used by an increasingly large segment of the population.
Social media is a vehicle for interactive communication
where the producers of content (e.g. patients) can also
be the consumers of content [1, 2]. By creating direct
communication, social media can be seen as an
equalizer, giving everyday people access to individuals
and institutions with whom they would be unlikely to
communicate otherwise. Social media permits the exchange of information and support to and between large
numbers of people [3]. Despite its uptake by large segments of the population, the use of social media in
healthcare has been less well-characterized. A variety of
uses have been explored, ranging from simply conveying
health information to messaging health promotion that
is intended to motivate change in health behavior.
As one unique aspect of consumer-focused communication, the USA permits direct-to-consumer (DTC) advertising. These communications take a variety of forms
including television, online communications, and print
advertisements. DTC requirements include the need for
“fair balance” that strikes the appropriate balance between risks of a particular medication and benefits for
its approved indication, and these advertisements are
under the governance of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) [4]. However, there has been limited
evaluation of how DTC messages are received by patients. It is possible that patients could be using social
media to discuss and even report novel benefits or risks
of newly licensed medications. This type of use would be
particularly salient shortly after a product becomes available in the marketplace where real-world data are typically scant.
Given the limited information on the use of social
media specific to arthritis and autoimmune conditions,
the three main objectives of this analysis were to (1) descriptively characterize the demographics of people using
social media to discuss rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and
psoriatic arthritis (PsA) and psoriasis; (2) to evaluate the
suitability of social media as a data source for drug safety
research, particularly for the study of recently licensed
molecules, and (3) classify the content and timing of the
posts that these social media users are contributing, with
a particular focus on communication related to newer
biologic drugs and small molecules in relation to DTC
advertising launch dates.
Methods
Data source

We used the Treato [5] technology to analyze all
publicly-available social media data including Facebook,
blogs, and discussion boards for posts mentioning inflammatory arthritis (e.g. rheumatoid arthritis or

Page 2 of 8

psoriatic arthritis) and specific mentions (by name) of
four medications used for RA (e.g. tofacitinib, tocilizumab, abatacept and etanercept). These represented
the three newest medications approved for RA (tofacitinib, tocilizumab and abatacept) and an anti-TNF agent
(etanercept) with greater specificity for arthritis in that it
is not used to treat inflammatory bowel disease.
The Treato platform identifies and collects publicly available user-generated content on health topics from over
10,000 sources. These sources include the publicly available
data on social networks such as Facebook and Twitter,
discussions forums and blogs. Over 2.5 billion posts were
analyzed from these sources. Natural language processing
(NLP) algorithms analyze this content to identify medical
concepts mentioned in text and extract patients’ selfreported descriptions of their health conditions and medications. More specifically, Treato takes medical terms and
maps them to formal concepts in a medical ontology [6].
This process includes resolving conceptual synonyms of
medical terms (e.g., myocardial infarction and heart attack);
resolution of patient-specific terms (e.g., “pain in my joints”
and “my joints hurt”) to medical terms; word-sense disambiguation algorithms (e.g., “BP” could refer to bi-polar
disorder, blood pressure, or a bisphosphonate medication);
and medication synonyms (e.g., generic and brand names for
the same medication). Following the textual processing,
posts are tagged with concepts, rather than just keywords,
which allows for finer search and filtering capabilities. For
example, a search for the herpes zoster concept would find
posts referring to either “herpes zoster” or “shingles” (synonym), but not to posts referring to “shingles vaccine” (unless
these posts also refer to “shingles” separately). In addition,
the data are analyzed to extract patients’ specific experiences,
making a distinction between posts that merely mention a
disease and posts in which patients report having the disease.
Other examples include identifying patients switching from
drug A to drug B, and drug side-effect reports. Individual
posts can be manually reviewed and classified by a subject
matter expert.
The unit of analysis was an individual post and each
term in the post, as described below. Although these data
are dynamic and change every minute, the data extracted
and used for this analysis extended through October 2015.
The characteristics of individuals contributing posts of
interest were described in relation to demographics and
geography, as consistent with the privacy settings of the
various social media sources that permit such disclosure
and their availability in the data.
For posts mentioning medications of interest, the
Treato platform was used to create word clouds to
summarize the frequencies of co-occurrence mentions,
with the size of the text represented as the relative frequency of each term compared with other terms. The
data were subsequently analyzed using disproportionality

Curtis et al. Arthritis Research & Therapy (2017) 19:48

methods (see subsequent text) to evaluate the content of
what was being discussed and to evaluate whether there
were novel topics associated with RA drugs of interest.
Analysis of pre-specified and empirically identified healthrelated events and concerns associated with specific RA
medications

For the analysis of medication safety, we pre-specified
two known health conditions and associated drugs recognized in large phase III clinical trials in RA (herpes
zoster and tofacitinib, and gastrointestinal perforation
and tocilizumab). Disease and symptom-related treatment indications (e.g. arthritis, joint pain) were manually
redacted and excluded from the database. The cooccurrence frequencies of each medication and either of
the two events (mentioned in the same post) were compared between RA medications and reported as pairwise
odds ratios (ORs), and were analyzed using Fisher’s exact
test. For this analysis, the threshold for statistical significance was p < 0.01.
Additionally, in a third analysis, empirically identified
mentions of safety events and symptoms with at least
five events that were co-occurring with mentions of RA
drugs were analyzed using disproportionality analysis,
one of the common methods used to analyze FDA Adverse Event Reporting System data [7, 8]. Results were
characterized first as relative reporting ratios (RRRs,
probability for event associated with a drug exposure divided by the probability for the event in the whole population) and as proportional reporting ratios (PRRs),
which could be conceptually interpreted as the probability of an event in drug exposure A divided by the probability of an event in drug exposure B.
Analysis of Twitter data related to arthritis medication
safety and tolerability

The top social media influencers were identified using
Symplur, which maintains a controlled database in which
each healthcare hashtag is vetted, checked for level of
critical mass, and grouped appropriately with other relevant hashtags and Twitter accounts. According to Symplur’s Healthcare Hashtag project that aggregates and
categorizes Twitter healthcare data, top “influencers”
were identified based upon the Twitter accounts that
tweet out the most content, and the accounts with content that is the most retweeted [9].
All drug-specific posts (“tweets”) for the four medications of interest were extracted from Twitter from 2014
to 2015, identified using drug names anywhere in the
post (and not only drug-specific hashtags), as was a 20%
random sample of tweets related to rheumatoid or psoriatic arthritis, regardless of their mention of specific medications. These were reviewed manually to determine
whether they were related to arthritis medications of

Page 3 of 8

interest and/or contained content associated with DTC
advertising. Tweets were classified manually into the apriori specific categories of a potential safety event, a
safety concern (i.e. fear about a future event), or medication tolerability (e.g. injection site burning or pain). Representative examples of tweets within each category
were selected for review to illustrate additional medical
themes and were shown as direct quotes, redacting information that might identify a contributor’s identity.
DTC launch dates of new USA television advertisements for etanercept, tofacitinib, and abatacept were obtained from the manufacturers of these agents. We
compared the volume of tweets in the 2 weeks following
the DTC launch to the 2 weeks prior to the DTC launch
date, using the paired t test to test the hypothesis that
there was an increased volume of social media posts following each new DTC advertising launch date. This analysis was conducted in both the tweets specifically
mentioning DTC advertisement content and again reanalyzed, using all available Twitter data.
Performance of automated classification via natural
language processing compared to manual review for
drug-associated herpes zoster events

Treato contains an NLP-based classifier to identify medical events and conditions to improve specificity beyond
simple text mining. To understand the performance
characteristics of this classifier operating within Treato,
the system was queried for posts mentioning both herpes zoster and one of the four drugs of interest (etanercept, abatacept, tocilizumab or tofacitinib). This prefiltering included matching posts that mentioned one of
the four drugs (or their synonyms), and contained a reference to herpes zoster (or one of its synonyms).
This initial pre-filtering yielded 602 posts, of which
a random sample of 425 were selected for manual review, to determine whether they represented a true
case of patient-reported herpes zoster or not. A true
case would be a patient who reported experiencing
shingles (herpes zoster), and a non-true case would
reflect that even though the drug and shingles (herpes
zoster) were mentioned in the post, the author was
not specifically claiming he or she had experienced
shingles. This association did not require the author
or the manual reviewer to assert or infer causality of
the herpes zoster event to be related to the drug.
These posts were evaluated by the Treato NLP classifier as to whether they represented a bona-fide case
of drug-associated shingles and were compared to the
gold standard of manual review. A contingency table
was generated that reported sensitivity (recall), specificity, positive predictive value (precision) (PPV), and
negative predictive value (NPV) compared to the gold
standard of manually reviewed cases. All analyses

Curtis et al. Arthritis Research & Therapy (2017) 19:48

were performed by SAS version 9.4 (Cary, NC, USA).
Patient consent was not required for this study given
that all data sources were publically available. The
university institutional review board governed the
study protocol.

Results
As of October 2015, there were 785,656 arthritis-related
posts discussing tofacitinib (n = 1279), etanercept (n =
23,530), abatacept (n = 4424), and tocilizumab (n =
1791). Posts were predominantly from the USA (75%)
and originating from the geographic distribution shown
in Fig. 1, predominantly from patients as authors (87%).
The age distribution of individuals contributing the
posts was <19 (18%), 19–29 (23%), 30–39 (20%), 40–49
(17%), 50–54 (17%), and 65+ (6%) years. Facebook (and
all of its groups) was the most common platform for social media discussions. Based upon data from Symplur
(accessed 26 May 2016), the most common sources for
social media mentions of RA on Twitter included a mix
of professional patient advocacy organizations and individual patients. The top USA-based influencers in relation to RA were @CreakyJoints, @ACRheum, and
@RheumaArthritis.
In the Treato platform, analysis of posts mentioning herpes zoster (n = 1815) associated with tofacitinib were compared with other RA medications and are shown in Table 1
(upper half). Many ORs were significantly increased for tofacitinib compared to other RA therapies. Similarly, many of
the associations between posts mentioning gastrointestinal
perforation and tocilizumab (n = 13) were significant compared to other RA therapies (Table 1, lower half).

Page 4 of 8

As an example, the co-occurrence frequencies of concepts associated with tofacitinib were shown as a word
cloud (Fig. 2). Co-therapies commonly given with each
of these drugs were frequently mentioned (e.g. prednisone, methotrexate). Terms that were somewhat more
specific for tofacitinib compared to other RA therapies
included “head” and “hair”. Based on a disproportionality
analysis, the health conditions uniquely mentioned in
posts on tofacitinib and tocilizumab were summarized
and ranked in descending order by proportional reporting ratios. Consistent with the word cloud, for tofacitinib
they were highest for alopecia universalis, alopecia totalis, male pattern baldness, alopecia areata, vitiligo, and
skin pigmentation; all these PRRs were significant at p <
0.0001: for tocilizumab, they were systemic sclerosis,
cytokine release syndrome, giant cell arteritis, endocarditis, sore tongue, and high cholesterol.
Extending the analysis beyond only examining term cooccurrence frequencies, the performance characteristics of
the automatic NLP classifier within Treato were examined
with respect to its ability to identify bona-fide HZ events
reported by patients that were associated with drugs of
interest. In Table 2, and compared to manual review of
posts as the gold standard, the PPV (precision) of the
automated NLP classifier was 91%, sensitivity (recall) was
71%, and specificity was 84%. When the sensitivity of the
algorithm was increased to 100% (i.e. classifying every
occurrence as a report), the PPV was lower but still high
(71%), and specificity was reduced to 0% (not shown).
Focusing specifically on Twitter data, 10,023 tweets
were manually reviewed. These mentioned arthritis
drugs (n = 8032), specifically etanercept (n = 4486,

1021, 10.2%) and abatacept (n = 888, 8.9%), plus tweets
mentioning no medication but that were derived from
the 20% random sample of posts related to inflammatory
arthritis (n = 1991, 19.9%). Of these, 481 (4.8%) were related to DTC advertisements, the majority of which were
specifically related to television advertisements (n = 290);
for most of the remainder, the type of media that the
DTC advertisement appeared in could not be inferred.
Of the 8032 tweets mentioning the four drugs of interest, 46 (<1%) identified a potential safety event, 277
(3.4%) mentioned a tolerability problem, and 327 (4.1%)
listed a safety concern. A number of medical themes
were present in the social media posts that could be at
times medically related. Table 3 shows representative examples of such themes. As described, patient posts were

discussions of tofacitinib (Xeljanz). Size of the text reflects the

focused on issues such as access to medications, safety
concerns, expectations of efficacy, and overall satisfaction with treatment. Themes were similar between arthritis medications. Among the 481 related to DTC
advertisements, 59 (12.3%) mentioned concerns about
drug safety. The most frequent safety concerns specifically mentioned, in descending order of frequency, were
cancer, death, fatal infections and gastrointestinal perforation. Fewer than 5% were positive with respective to describing favorable aspects of the medications.
There were six product-specific DTC advertising campaigns for etanercept, abatacept and tofacitinib in 2014–
2015. Using all the Twitter data without restriction to
tweets mentioning DTC ads, there was no significant association between the timing of new DTC ad launches
and the volume of social media posts for each of the advertised RA medications. However, after restricting analysis to the data mentioning DTC advertisements (n =
481), tweets mentioning DTC advertising were disproportionately approximately threefold greater in the
2 weeks following the DTC launch than in the two
weeks prior to it (p = 0.04).

Discussion
Using a software platform that searched all public-facing
social media, we examined content related to inflammatory arthritis (e.g. RA, psoriatic arthritis) and the medications used for its treatment. We found a large volume
of posts related to this health condition and associated
drug therapy. Using social media content, we confirmed
known associations between mentions of herpes zoster
and tofacitinib, and gastrointestinal perforation and tocilizumab, as expected based on large phase III clinical trials. We also found social media content related to hair
regrowth and skin re-pigmentation, a novel observation
seen with patients receiving tofacitinib. Finally, we observed a small but measurable impact of DTC advertising on posts from patients commenting on these
advertisements. However, fewer than 5% of such communications were positive, and many invoked
medication-related safety fears expressed by patients.
This analysis examined social media in relation to
arthritis and its treatments, and we note that social
media has been studied for a variety of health conditions
including cancer [10, 11], diabetes [12, 13] and obesity
[14]. Our interest was focused on the application of social media to medical product safety and patientperceived safety, a topic that has been recently examined
across a number of therapeutic areas [15–18]. Prior
work has identified correlation between adverse events
as recorded in electronic health records and patient concerns assessed in social media data [19]. In another
study, content analysis of social media posts related to
the recall of an over-the-counter medication found that

the use of Facebook allowed patients to interact with the
manufacturer in relation to communicating product recall messaging and related risk, and to promote patient
support and self-efficacy [20].
While social media content has been commonly
used to convey medication-related information, much
less work has been done to understand whether the
information is both understood clearly and made actionable, nor to assess what patients are saying about
the content that they encounter. In an analysis of
Facebook pages related to the 20 most-searched
health conditions on Google, the largest percentage
of pages (32.2%, n = 168) were dedicated to marketing or promotion; 20.7% (n = 108) to information;
and 13.0% (n = 68) to social support [21]. In 2008,
the drug industry spent $4 billion on DTC advertising, of which less than 4% was directed toward online media [22]. However, expenditure on DTC
advertising has increased substantially over time, and
across all forms of communication, DTC spending
grew to US$5.4 billion in 2015 [23]. Overall, the
pharmaceutical industry spent an estimated US$1.93
billion on digital advertising in 2016 [24].
Because the world of social media is largely unmonitored, it has the potential to be co-opted or thwarted,

whether intentionally or unintentionally. For example,
the Movember Foundation sought to raise awareness of
health risks including prostate and testicular cancer, but
only 0.7% of all tweets occurring during the campaign
were focused on this topic, and discussions in the USA
were dominated by the discussions around moustache
grooming [25]. More generally, social media used to
support messaging from pharmaceutical, for-profit
healthcare companies, or individual stakeholders, can
carry similar risks. For example, online pharmacies of
questionable trustworthiness may market to patients;
non-experts may share information of questionable validity; and consumer perceptions of the benefits or risks
of a treatment may become exaggerated [26]. Encouragingly, research conducted on DTC advertising [27] has
found some success in communicating medication information to lay audiences [28–30]. In this project that examined patient sentiment captured via social media
related to DTC advertising, we found a small but measurable impact on the volume of comments related to advertising of medications after the launch of televisionbased DTC advertisements for biologic therapies. However, patients’ sentiments about the medications were
typically to be unfavorable, more often expressing concerns about safety and tolerability problems than

expressing hope that the medication might provide an
effective treatment option.
In an empiric example of using social media data to
identify drug-associated medical events, we found that
the PPV (precision) of an automated NLP classifier to
find bona-fide cases of HZ reported by patients was high
(91%), sensitivity was reasonable (71%) and specificity
was also high (84%). One might conclude that for a
large-scale project where manual review is not feasible,
the system might be used in an automated fashion with
an acceptably high PPV to detect early safety signals.
However, if time and resources permit, manual review of
social media posts is helpful to identify more true cases
and improve the specificity of classifying safety events.
The generalizability and reach of social media deserves some mention. According to Pew’s Demographics of Social Media study that polled 1907
participants by phone in 2015, 1612 of whom were
Internet users, 72% of adult Internet users use Facebook and 23% of all Internet users use Twitter [31].
The vast majority of younger adults used Facebook,
including 82% of adults ages 18–29 years and 79% of
adults ages 30–49 years. Social media is also growing
in popularity among older adults; among adults with
Internet access, nearly two thirds of middle-aged
adults and about half of individuals over 65 years of
age use Facebook. Facebook is more popular among
women than men, and 77% of women are users [31].
Twitter is more popular among urban residents than
it is among their suburban or rural counterparts and
there is a larger age gap among users; 30% of online
adults under 50 years of age use Twitter, compared
with 11% of online adults ages 50 years and older
[31]. Perhaps contrary to expectation, the so-called
“digital divide” is not necessarily present among social media users. People of color who have Internet
access have been shown to be more likely to use social media than their white counterparts [32]. Moreover, there is some evidence that social media may
give traction to health interventions with “hard-toreach” populations, such as Spanish-speaking Latino
men who have sex with men (MSM) by using different platforms including Facebook, Craigslist and
smartphone applications [33].
The strengths of our study include a novel look at a
global information source that has been infrequently
studied in healthcare, using a robust platform that extracted medical terms, resolved synonyms, and enabled
quantitative analysis. However, there are some limitations inherent to such data. The demographics of people
using social media are still evolving, but social media is
disproportionately used by younger people. In our sample, 60% of patients were younger than age 40 years.
Additionally, the availability of demographic information

Page 7 of 8

was predicated on people being willing to use relaxed
privacy settings on their own characteristics, including
geolocation. Comfort with sharing this information is
likely to be variable by patient community and is likely
to change over time. Additionally, while we analyzed individual posts, tweets, and terms in them, future analyses that can extract terms not only within posts but
across posts, within the same thread or even across
threads, are likely to be useful, given that patients may
be constrained in the length of their posts and tweets.
For example, Twitter limits tweets to 140 characters, although this may change over time [34]. Similarly, longitudinal analysis of an author’s posts across a timeline
could open the door to additional types of analysis. Finally, manual review of raw posts can be accommodated
within the Treato platform, but was labor-intensive,
given the sometimes limited relevance of Twitter data to
our use case. However, the pre-filtering capability of the
Treato platform could make this type of manual review
process much more efficient.

Conclusions
Social media is a challenging, yet promising data source
that may complement traditional methods to study new
medications shortly after licensure. While social media data
may be useful for hypothesis generation for safety evaluation or even off-label indications, results should be interpreted with caution, and should assist in guiding focused
follow-up studies.
