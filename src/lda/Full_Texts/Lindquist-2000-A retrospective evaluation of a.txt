Adverse Drug Reaction Signals in the
WHO International Database

Abstract

Background: The detection of new drug safety signals is of growing importance
with ever more new drugs becoming available and exposure to medicines increasing. The task of evaluating information relating to safety lies with national agencies and, for international data, with the World Health Organization Programme
for International Drug Monitoring.
Rationale: An established approach for identifying new drug safety signals from
the international database of more than 2 million case reports depends upon clinical experts from around the world. With a very large amount of information to
evaluate, such an approach is open to human error. To aid the clinical review, we
have developed a new signalling process using Bayesian logic, applied to data
mining, within a confidence propagation neural network (Bayesian Confidence Propagation Neural Network; BCPNN). Ultimately, this will also allow the evaluation of complex variables.
Methods: The first part of this study tested the predictive value of the BCPNN
in new signal detection as compared with reference literature sources (Martindale’s
Extra Pharmacopoeia in 1993 and July 2000, and the Physicians Desk Reference
in July 2000). In the second part of the study, results with the BCPNN method were
compared with those of the former signalling procedure.
Results: In the study period (the first quarter of 1993) 107 drug–adverse reaction
combinations were highlighted as new positive associations by the BCPNN, and
referred to new drugs. 15 drug–adverse reaction combinations on new drugs became
negative BCPNN associations in the study period. The BCPNN method detected
signals with a positive predictive value of 44% and the negative predictive value
was 85%. 17 as yet unconfirmed positive associations could not be dismissed with
certainty as false positive signals.
Of the 10 drug–adverse reaction signals produced by the former signal detection
system from data sent out for review during the study period, 6 were also identified
by the BCPNN. These 6 associations have all had a more than 10-fold increase of
reports and 4 of them have been included in the reference sources. The remaining
4 signals that were not identified by the BCPNN had a small, or no, increase in the
number of reports, and are not listed in the reference sources.

Conclusion: Our evaluation showed that the BCPNN approach had a high and
promising predictive value in identifying early signals of new adverse drug reactions.

Background
The Uppsala Monitoring Centre, as the WHO Collaborating Centre for international drug monitoring, is responsible for the technical and scientific
maintenance and development of the WHO International Drug Monitoring Programme. The programme
now has 56 member countries, annually contributing around 150 000 suspected adverse drug reaction
(ADR) reports to the WHO database in Uppsala.
One of the main aims of the international pharmacovigilance programme is to identify early signals
of safety problems related to medicines. To aid this,
a new ADR signalling system has been implemented
by the Uppsala Monitoring Centre. It complements
the previous signal generation procedure which involved the examination of large, unwieldy amounts
of sorted and tabulated material by an expert panel.
We have previously published an overview of the new
signalling approach, including results from an
evaluation including a comparison against another
signalling system.[1] The new system is based on a
data mining technique, using a Bayesian Confidence
Propagation Neural Network (BCPNN) to scan incoming ADR reports and compare them statistically with what is already stored in the database.[2,3]
The new quarterly output contains statistical information from the BCPNN scan. It also contains frequency counts for each drug and ADR listed, individually and occurring together. The figures from the
previous quarter are also included and the data is
provided in a computerised format.
Drug–adverse reaction combinations that are statistically significantly different from the background of reports (‘associations’) are sent to a panel of
reviewers for evaluation and expert opinion. Within
the WHO Programme a ‘signal’ concerns ‘information regarding a possible relationship between a drug
and an adverse event or interaction’.[4] As before,
signals of possible safety problems are circulated to
all national centres participating in the interna© Adis International Limited. All rights reserved.

tional pharmacovigilance programme for consideration of public health implications.
The aim of the 2 parts of this study was to evaluate
the ability of the BCPNN system to:
• pick up signals early, i.e. before publication in a
standard reference source (study I);
• pick up valid signals, i.e. drug–adverse reaction
associations that are described in a standard reference source;
• pick up signals identified in the previous signal
generation system.
Methods
BCPNN Methodology

The BCPNN methodology[2,3] uses a neural network architecture to identify unexpectedly strong
dependencies between variables (e.g. drugs and adverse reactions) within the WHO database, and how
dependencies change on addition of new data. The
dependencies are selected using a measure of disproportionality called the Information Component
(IC):
IC = log 2

Pxy
Px Py

Where:
Px = probability of a specific drug being listed on
a case report;
Py = probability of a specific ADR being listed
on a case report;
Pxy = probability that a specific drug–adverse reaction combination is listed on a case report.
Thus the IC value is based on:
• the number of case reports with drug X (Cx)
• the number of case reports with ADR Y (Cy)
• the number of reports with the specific combination (Cxy)
• the total number of reports (C).
Positive IC values indicate that the particular combination of variables is reported to the database more
often than statistically expected from reports alDrug Safety 2000 Dec; 23 (6)

Data Mining to Find New Adverse Drug Reaction Signals

ready in the database. The higher the value of the IC,
the more the combination stands out from the background.
From the distribution of the IC, expectation and
variance values are calculated using Bayesian statistics. The standard deviation for each IC provides
a measure of the robustness of the value. The higher
the Cx, Cy and Cxy levels are, the narrower the confidence interval becomes. If a positive IC value increases over time and the confidence interval narrows, this shows a likelihood of a positive quantitative
association between the studied variables.
In this study we used drug as variable ‘x’ and adverse reaction as variable ‘y’. The term ‘association’
denotes a drug-adverse reaction combination where
the lower 95% confidence limit of the IC value is
above 0.

2000 online version of the US Physicians’ Desk
Reference.[6] The latter reference source contains
labelling information approved by the US Food and
Drug Administration (FDA) and was used as a second reference, because of its comprehensive listing
of ADRs, recognised as well as suspected.
All reports in the WHO database are coded using
the WHO Adverse Reaction Terminology. This is a
hierarchical classification, with the following levels:
• system organ class: a group of adverse reaction
terms pertaining to the same body organ system
• high level term: a grouping term for qualitatively
similar preferred terms
• preferred term: main terms for coding of adverse
reactions
• included term: lower level terms, e.g. synonyms
with, or more specific terms than, the preferred
terms.
In the analysis we used the WHO preferred terms
of the selected associations and compared those against the listed terms or descriptions used in Martindale and the Physicians’ Desk Reference.
The following codes were used:
• N = the drug was found in the source but no matching ADR or corresponding high level terms were
described for the drug or for the drug group;
• NA = not applicable, i.e. the drug was not found
in the source, or was noted as being withdrawn
from the market
• Y+ = a high level term pertaining to the ‘preferred
term’ of the ADR, but not the specific ADR, was
described for the drug; or, the same ADR, or a
high level term, was listed for the group to which
the drug was referred to but not listed for the
drug itself
• Y = the drug was found and the same ADR, or
a synonym, was listed for the drug.

Test of BCPNN Predictive Value in
Signal Detection

A retrospective standard quarterly BCPNN database screening was made for the first quarter of
1993. We selected for analysis drug–adverse reaction combinations which in this quarter became positive ‘associations’ (the lower 95% confidence limit
of the IC value changed from a negative to a positive value), and which included new drugs (first
reported to the WHO database in 1990 or later). We
also selected combinations referring to new drugs,
for which the upper 95% confidence limit of the IC
changed from a positive to a negative value in the
study period. In this paper these are referred to as
negative associations.
We then analysed if these positive and negative
associations were widely known at the time. This was
done by checking if they were listed in the 30th edition of Martindale[5] published in 1993. Martindale
was chosen as it is a standard compendium of drug
information, available worldwide and containing
monographs based on published information.
We subsequently analysed if the selected associations had been strengthened or confirmed over
the 7 year period from 1993 to 2000. The associations
were therefore checked against Martindale, the
July 2000 online edition,[6] and also against the July

Lindquist et al.

Before the introduction of the BCPNN, quarterly
printouts at 2 threshold levels were sent to a review
panel for the selection of possible signals:
• ‘level 2’: at least 2 case reports of the combination,
with the drug being reported as suspected of having caused the reaction
• ‘level 5’: at least 5 case reports of the combination, with the drug being reported as suspected of
having caused the reaction.
For this test, we selected all drug–adverse reaction
combinations, which had been listed in the ‘level 2’
listing of the first quarter of 1993 and had gone on
to be circulated as signals.
We checked if these were included in the 30th edition of Martindale,[5] Martindale June 1999 online
version[7] and the June 1999 online version of the
Physicians’ Desk Reference,[7] and we analysed the
increase of reports from 1993 to 1999 for the signalled combinations.

Results
Test of BCPNN Predictive Value in
Signal Detection

In the first quarter of 1993, 682 drug–adverse reaction combinations fulfilled the quantitative threshold criteria for new BCPNN positive associations.
107 of these concerned new drugs. Another 32 combinations became negative associations in the study
period. 15 of those referred to new drugs.
The literature reference sources (30th edition of
Martindale,[5] Martindale online July 2000 and
Physician’s Desk Reference online July 2000[6])
were checked for references to the 107 positive and
the 15 negative associations selected for analysis.
The results are shown in table I and II.
As seen in table I, 71 of the positive associations
were not listed at all in the 30th edition of Martindale.[5] 29 were listed by a higher level term, or indirectly, by referral to another drug in the same group,
while only 7 positive associations were specifically
mentioned.
For the negative associations, more than half
were listed in the 30th edition of Martindale,[5] either specifically or indirectly.
Table II shows that 78 positive associations have
been strengthened or confirmed in current literature, whereas 29 were not listed. Of the negative associations, 10 were now listed.
The aim of the Uppsala Monitoring Centre signalling process is to identify previously undetected
adverse reactions to medicines. Thus, we consider
drug–adverse reactions already known as nonsignals (in this study there were 36 positive and 8 negative such associations). In addition there were 10
positive and 2 negative associations relating to a
drug withdrawn immediately before the study period,
and 2 positive associations relating to a drug withdrawn during the study period. These 14 associations
were excluded. Hence we obtained the results
shown in table III.
From this, the positive predictive value is 44%
(42 of 95) and the negative predictive value is 85%
(11 of 13).

at the end of the first quarter of 1999. On the other
hand, the 6 signals that were BCPNN associations
have all had more than a 10-fold increase in number
of reports to date.
Four of the 6 signals that passed the associations
threshold did so before being circulated within the
WHO Programme. Two did not, and, although sumatriptan and confusion became an association in the
fourth quarter of 1993, the quantitative strength of
the relationship has since decreased.

V. The increase in the number of reports from the
first quarter of 1993, to the first quarter of 1999, is
also shown in table V. On analysis, 6 of the 10 signals have fulfilled the BCPNN association criteria.
The remaining 4 drug–adverse reaction combinations still had no more than 4 case reports for each

Discussion
At the start of the WHO International Drug Monitoring Programme in the late 1960s quantitative
and statistical methods were proposed for adverse
reaction signalling purposes.[8] Because of constraints in computational power these were not realised at the time. Lately, however, there has been
a renewed interest in statistical methods applied to
signal generation in pharmacovigilance. We are
aware of work being done in several countries based
on proportional reporting ratios and odds ratios,
and, in the US, a Bayesian data mining tool for signal
generation has been developed for the FDA.[9]
The assessment of an ADR signalling system is
difficult because there is no ‘gold standard’ for comparison. Also there are different definitions of the

term ‘signal’. According to the definition used in
the WHO Programme a signal is essentially a hypothesis together with data and arguments, and it is
not only uncertain but also preliminary in nature:
the situation may change substantially over time.[4,10]
For the purpose of the paper we felt we would
achieve a reasonable estimate of the predictive power
of the BCPNN tool by checking historical associations identified by the BCPNN against standard
reference sources. Martindale has worldwide coverage, recognition and wide availability and was used
as a standard for well known, recognised ADRs.
The Physicians’ Desk Reference, though not international, gives very recent information on drugs. It
has a comprehensive ADR listing, generally more
inclusive than that of Martindale. However, the
Physicians’ Desk Reference also includes suspected adverse reactions, whether substantiated or not.
We considered an ADR listed in the Physicians’
Desk Reference an indication of a possible drug–
adverse reaction relationship. Table IV lists the
positive associations still not mentioned in the reference sources. These cannot simply be dismissed
as ‘false positives’, since at least some of them may
be true signals of ADRs that are not yet established.
The reader can draw some conclusions about them
in addition to the comments in the table. Several of
the associations in table IV raise the point that there
may well be alternative explanations, relating, for
example, to the way in which the drug is used, or
confounding underlying disease. However, the reviewer should not dismiss the drug as causal too
readily. Similarly also ‘true negatives’ might be as
yet unrecognised signals.
The length of time chosen for the retrospective
check against the literature was not arbitrary, but based
on the assumption that 7 years would be sufficient
for ADRs to be included in the reference sources,
allowing for the maximum reporting for new drugs
to have taken place (the Weber effect). We know
however that 1 new association appeared in Martindale between 1999 and 2000, and 7 years still may
not be long enough. Publishing delay must be considered in the use of these reference sources, but

this is minimised now by their availability online using an Internet browser.
The use of our selected literature sources as a ‘gold
standard’ is open to debate. The literature is not intended as an early signalling system, and uses many
sources for its information other than the WHO database: the biases affecting inclusion and exclusion
of ADR information therefore may be very different. Factors, such as those affecting the differential
reporting to WHO and the inclusion of new information in the reference sources will have an effect
which is independent of the performance of the
BCPNN. The BCPNN is run every quarter, and we
selected just one quarter: since the BCPNN is used
in continuous analysis, the specificity and sensitivity are subject to necessary time-dependent changes
in classification of ‘positives’ and ‘negatives’. It is
difficult to consider something as a ‘nonassociation’
because of this time dependency, and it is clear that
there is an asymmetry in the effect of time on our
results: associations cannot become nonassociations
with time, whereas nonassociations can whereas non© Adis International Limited. All rights reserved.

associations may become associations with time. To
avoid this we have considered the inverse of a positive association a definite negative association in
this paper. Another asymmetry is that the negative
associations are a selection of all nonassociations.
This assumes that definite negative associations represent all nonassociations, though it is clear that
some nonassociations will became positive associations in time. This again shows the difficulty of
evaluating a signalling system.
An assumption was made that a substantial increase in the number of reports of an association over
the period indicated ongoing clinical interest in an
association. More reports may be seen as a support
for the validity of the associations, though there is
often a tendency for ADRs that are becoming well
known to be reported more frequently. Therefore,
the associations in table IV for which the number
of reports have increased are of particular interest.
Another obvious limitation is that our method for
signal generation is dependent on the terminology
used for recording of adverse reactions. Very little

work has been done on any of the medical terminologies in use or proposed to determine their relative
value in searching for new drug signals.[11]
We found that 44% of the BCPNN signals are
strengthened or confirmed in the current reference
sources while not mentioned at all in the 30th edition of Martindale (1993).[5] The 84% negative predictive value indicates that combinations not highlighted for review, if not already known, are unlikely
to become signals. This indicates that the BCPNN
is a valuable tool in the filtering of combinations for
clinical review, and that it has the ability to find early
signals. The normal methods for assessing the power
of a method are difficult to apply to the BCPNN, because of the reasons above.
The BCPNN associations, which are not yet reported in the current literature, are included in table
IV. If these associations were to emerge in the literature in the coming years, it would increase the positive predictive value of the BCPNN.
The BCPNN has the power to analyse signals
further.[3] We are developing its use for looking at
complex variables to see whether parameters such as
gender, age, and other drug use increase the strength
of association, and whether ‘syndromes’ of reported
terms are present. However, as with any subdivision
of data, a very large amount is necessary initially,
to attain statistical significance in subsets. This is a
major advantage of using the large pooled WHO database, and we are trying to maximise this potential.
The BCPNN is not a panacea for drug safety monitoring. The drug–ADR combinations which reach
statistical significance, do so only in comparison with
the background experience of 2 million case reports.
This is particularly important for commonly reported ADRs, which, however serious, would not
reach significance until the quantitative experience
for a drug and such an ADR is excessive. Sumatriptan and confusion is an example of this issue, passing the BCPNN association threshold after being circulated as a signal.
We have stressed[1] that although the BCPNN
approach has its limitations and is not a substitute for
expert review, it does have a place particularly where
large volumes of data are involved. It is reassuring,

however, that all signals identified in the previous
system that went on to become frequently reported
in the WHO database were also identified in the retrospective BCPNN analysis.

Conclusions
This retrospective evaluation of the new statistical signalling tool used at the Uppsala Monitoring Centre has shown that the BCPNN has a high
predictive value, and that it can identify early signals of adverse drug reactions. It has further strengthened our view that the BCPNN will provide a useful tool in international pharmacovigilance.
To our knowledge, this is the first time an ADRsignalling method has been subjected to a rigorous
performance analysis. The lack of a ‘gold standard’.
and the dynamic nature of signal finding with time
make conventional validation methods difficult to
apply.

Disclaimer
The WHO database contains summary reports of individual suspected adverse reactions to medicines, received from
national centres in countries participating in the WHO International Drug Monitoring Programme. No causality assessment is made at the Uppsala Monitoring Centre, but if such an
assessment has been made by the national centre submitting
the report, this is stored in the database. Since these reports
constitute suspicions of adverse drug reactions, further investigation and research is needed for a full interpretation of the
data.
