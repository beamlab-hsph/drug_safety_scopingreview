Abstract. Every year adverse drug events (ADEs) are known to be responsible for
98,000 deaths in the USA. Classical methods rely on report statements, expert
knowledge, and staff operated record review. One of our objectives, in the PSIP
project framework, is to use data mining (e.g., decision trees) to electronically
identify situations leading to risk of ADEs. 10,500 hospitalization records from
Denmark and France were used. 500 rules were automatically obtained, which are
currently being validated by experts. A decision support system to prevent ADEs
is then to be developed. The article examines a decision tree and the rules in the
field of vitamin K antagonists.

1. Introduction
Every year, adverse drug events (ADEs) are known to be responsible for 10,000 deaths
in France and 98,000 deaths in the USA [1] in both ambulatory care and hospitalization.
During hospitalization some ADEs can be prevented when the medication use process
is managed by a computerized provider order entry (CPOE) coupled with a clinical
decision support system (CDSS). Some alert rules can then be implemented, e.g., when
a drug is prescribed despite a contraindication. Those alert rules are usually designed
by experts according to academic knowledge taken from summaries of drug
characteristics and from ADE report statements. Unfortunately only a tiny proportion
of ADEs is known to be reported that way [2, 3].
The so produced rules are used in the same way in each medical department
although those departments may differ a lot on several aspects: the patient may differ
(disease, associated pathologies, age, gender, …), the drugs may differ (drug approval,
price and availability, …), the prescriptions may differ (depending on the physician’s
specialty and knowledge, risk aversion, scientific beliefs, local procedures, …).
Therefore the alerts are too numerous and not accurate enough in those typical methods.
Our work aims at using data mining [4]:

to generate decision rules that could prevent these ADEs. Those decision rules
will be specific to each medical department
3. to implement the rules in a contextualized CDSS
This work is part of the PSIP project (Patient Safety through Intelligent Procedures
in medication) [5], a European project funded by the European Research Council [6, 7].
13 different partners from 6 countries are involved. The project began in January 2008
and is due to last 40 months.

2. Material and Methods
2.1. Data Model Definition, Data Extraction and Control
Data from Electronic Health Records (EHRs) seemed to be the best data source in the
field of ADE [8, 9]. Available data were extracted from EHR including:
 medical and administrative information
 diagnoses using ICD10 codes [10]
 drug prescriptions using the ATC classification [11]
 laboratory results using the IUPAC classification [12]
A consensual data model containing eight tables and 92 fields was defined. Its
design was based on an informal case review and on an identification of the available
data in France and in Denmark. An iterative quality control of the data was performed
in order to improve the extraction mechanisms. The extraction process will soon be
extended to more records. The present work reviewed 10,500 complete hospital stays
over year 2007, mostly from cardiologic and geriatric units:
 Capital Region of Denmark hospitals (Denmark): 2,700 stays
 Rouen university hospital (France): 800 stays
 Denain hospital (France): 7,000 stays
2.2. From Data to Information: Data Aggregation
The datasets fit an 8-table relational scheme that cannot be used for statistical analysis:
(1) no statistical method can deal with an 8-table data scheme
(2) classes are too numerous (ICD10: 17,000 codes, ATC: 5,400 codes…)
(3) some variables are collected several times during the same stay, such as lab results
(a red cells’ count can be assessed 20 times during the stay, with normal, above or
below normal results) or drug prescriptions.
Data aggregation processes were defined for each kind of variables. Data
aggregation engines were fed with data aggregation policies that had to be defined too.
At the moment:
 the 18,000 ICD10 codes are aggregated into 52 categories of chronic diseases.
 the 5,400 ATC codes are aggregated into 244 drug categories.
 lab results are aggregated therefore 31 biological abnormalities can be traced.
The data aggregation produces one dataset per department. In each dataset up to
564 cause variables can be used to explain or predict 48 effect variables.

2.3. From Information to Statistical Association: Data Analysis
The aggregation process helps to identify potential ADE causes and potential ADE
effects. The aim of statistical analysis is to identify links between (combination of)
potential causes and potential effects. Decision trees [13–18] with the CART method
were used thanks to the RPART package [19] of R [20]. Decision trees produce several
rules containing 1 to K conditions such as: “IF( condition_1 & … & condition_K)
THEN outcome might occur”. Each rule is characterized by:
 its confidence: proportion of outcome knowing that conditions are matched
Confidence = P( outcome | condition_1 … condition_K)
 its support: proportion of records matching both conditions and outcome
Support = P( outcome  condition_1 … condition_K)
2.4. From Association to ADE Detection and Decision Rules: Experts Validation
Some physicians performed a theoretical validation of the so obtained associations.
They validated only those that looked like ADEs and possible related causes according
to various sources. This review used several web information portals [21–23], Pubmed
[24] referenced papers, and French summaries of product characteristics.
In order to make sure that the validated rules are reliable, some experts will have to
review the hospital stays that the rules singled out. This work is currently being
performed.

3. Results
Decision trees were automatically generated. The aim was to identify associations
between potential ADE effects and potential ADE causes. It was thus possible to get
more than 500 association rules. So far 40 out of these 500 association rules have been
validated according to academic knowledge and can be used as decision rules.

Figure 2. Four examples of decision rules that allow to increase P(too low INR during stay)

In the following example the “occurrence of too low an INR” effect is tracked in a
medical department (Figure 1). When patients are under vitamin K antagonist (VKA),
the international normalized ratio (INR) is monitored in order to evaluate the treatment.
In case of too high INR (VKA overdose) the patient is exposed to hemorrhage. In case
of too low INR (VKA underdose) the patient is exposed to a risk of thrombosis.
When a patient is admitted in the department with too high an INR (risk of
bleeding) there might be an over-correction of the treatment and a risk of thrombosis in
29% of cases (Figure 2a). Elder patients admitted with too high an INR and
hypoalbuminemia are over-corrected in 87% cases (Figure 2b). VKA are bound to
albumin in the blood. Only the unbound fraction is biologically active.
Hypoalbuminemia was probably the cause of the too high INR but it also probably
increased the effect of VKA correction.
67% of patients who were admitted with a normal INR and received both VKA
and a prokinetic drug, experienced too low an INR (Figure 2c). Prokinetic drugs
decrease VKA adsorption. 60% of patients under 76 that are given VKA and beta
lactam antibiotics experience too low an INR (Figure 2d). Several interpretations are
possible: the antibiotic indicates an infection. Infections may increase hepatic
catabolism and decrease VKA bio-availability. Otherwise, antibiotics decrease vitamin
K production in the digestive tract: the prescriber may be well aware of this effect and
overbalance it by decreasing VKA dose.

4. Discussion and Conclusion
This work automatically identifies ADE-prone hospital stays from decision trees using
causes-effect statistical associations. Those associations are computed in each
department separately. Experts then validate the decision rules that can be used in a
CDSS. The rules are specific to each department and refer to situations that have
actually occurred. The first results of the PSIP project are encouraging [18] and
announce a new method in ADE studies, while current methods essentially rely on
time-consuming case reviews [25] or database queries which do not use statistical tools
[26–28].
Most of the rules that were validated are already known. But the academic
knowledge about drugs presents several problems. First, the rules are too numerous for
professionals (around 100 rules in the French drug characteristics summaries for
common VKAs). The weighting of the knowledge is based on the severity of the
effects. But the most important rules are well known by physicians and the related
ADEs seem to occur quite rarely. Moreover the appropriate weights would be different
depending on the medical departments. Finally the academic knowledge does not deal
with specific circumstances (e.g., “the patient was admitted with too high an INR”).
Unfortunately such organizational causes cannot be found in the medical literature yet.

Our rules were first validated using the academic sources. The hospital stays will
eventually be reviewed by experts in order to confirm the existence of ADEs. Then
human factors will have to be taken into account: when an alert occurs, the system has
to consider what the user is entitled to do, what his profile is and at which step the alert
is given.
