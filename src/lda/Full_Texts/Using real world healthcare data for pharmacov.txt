A prospective pharmacovigilance signal detection study, comparing the real-world healthcare
data (EU-ADR) and two spontaneous reporting system (SRS) databases, US FDA’s Adverse
Event Reporting System and WHO’s Vigibase is reported. The study compared drug safety
signals found in the EU-ADR and SRS databases. The potential for signal detection in the EUADR system was found to be dependent on frequency of the event and utilization of drugs
in the general population. The EU-ADR system may have a greater potential for detecting
signals for events occurring at higher frequency in general population and those that are
commonly not considered as potentially a drug-induced event. Factors influencing various
differences between the datasets are discussed along with potential limitations and
applications to pharmacovigilance practice.

spontaneous reporting systems

In pharmacovigilance, a signal is defined as
‘information that arises from one or multiple
sources (including observations and experiments), which suggests a new potentially causal
association, or a new aspect of a known association, between an intervention and an event or
set of related events, either adverse or beneficial,
that is judged to be of sufficient likelihood to
justify verificatory action’ [1]. It is important to
note that, by definition, a ‘signal’ requires further evaluation, as this definition pertains to an
unverified drug–event combination [2]. In pharmacovigilance practice, the process of signal
detection is a hypothesis generation exercise,
and additional clinical evaluation is necessary to
verify a causality relationship between the signal
and the event [2,3]. In the last four decades,
since the thalidomide disaster of the early
1960s [4], and continuing with the more recent
reports of adverse drug reactions (ADRs)
including nimesulide and cerivastatin, spontaneous ADR reporting systems (SRS) have
been the cornerstone of signal detection in
10.1586/17512433.2015.992878

pharmacovigilance [5,6]. The SRS were implemented to collect data where a reporter had at
least a suspicion that a drug caused an adverse
event (i.e., causality is assumed) [7]. However,
the rofecoxib story highlighted the significant
limitations of the SRS with respect to early
detection of ADRs, especially for those adverse events that are not commonly thought
to be drug induced and have multiple risk factors [8]. SRS suffer from underreporting, where
approximately <10% of serious ADRs are
reported [9]. At the same time, over-reporting
and selective reporting of events that require
risk management and risk minimization measures is also observed.
The increasing availability of electronic
healthcare records (EHRs) offers important
opportunities to investigate a wide spectrum
of ADRs and to detect drug safety signals
closer to real use and time as EHR databases
record information for large populations and
for long follow-up periods, irrespective of suspicion of causality [10]. A number of data

mining techniques have been specifically developed for the
automatic detection of drug safety signals using either SRS or
EHR databases [11–15]. Several international initiatives including the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership [16,17];
the US FDA Sentinel Initiative [18]; the European Commission
funded projects ‘Exploring and Understanding ADRs by integrative mining of clinical records and biomedical knowledge’
[EU-ADR] [19,20]; and the ‘Pharmacoepidemiological Research
on Outcomes of Therapeutics by a European Consortium’
[PROTECT] have focused on testing the potential of signal
detection specifically using longitudinal electronic health record
databases [21].
This article describes one of the many activities of the EUADR project concerning signal detection. The EU-ADR project, which ran between 2008 and 2013, led to the alliance of
different administrative/claims and general practice databases,
creating a resource of unprecedented size for drug safety monitoring in Europe (around 30 million persons from seven different databases). The overall scope of the EU-ADR project was
to design, develop and validate a computerized integrative

system that utilizes data from EHRs and biomedical databases
for the early detection of ADRs.
In this article, we describe the results of a direct comparison
(i.e., without using pre-defined reference standards of positive
and negative controls) between EU-ADR and two SRS databases: the FDA’s Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS)
and the WHO’s VigiBase (VigiBase). The objectives of this
study were to measure and compare the number of signals
identified in EU-ADR database network and SRS databases and
evaluate the extent of concordance in signal detection between
EU-ADR and SRS databases. The preliminary results were presented in 2011 [22].
Methods
Data sources

Data from the EU-ADR database network, FAERS and VigiBase were used for the analysis. The EU-ADR database network
is comprised of seven established European healthcare databases
located in three countries. Health-Search (HSD; Italy), Integrated Primary Care Information (IPCI: Netherlands) and
Pedianet (Italy) are primary care databases, where both clinical
information including medical diagnoses drug prescriptions are
recorded. The Aarhus University Hospital Database (Aarhus,
Denmark), PHARMO (Netherlands) and the regional Italian
databases of Lombardy and Tuscany are comprehensive
record-linkage systems in which drug dispensing data of welldefined populations is linked to a registry of hospital discharge
diagnoses and other registries collecting clinical information.
The main characteristics of the EU-ADR database network
have been described in more detail by Coloma et al [23,24]. The
data collected between the years 1995 and 2010 were used in
this study [24].
The FAERS and VigiBase databases were utilized as a data
source for spontaneous reports. FAERS was established in
1969 to support post-marketing safety surveillance programs in
the US. At the time of this analysis, FAERS contained over
seven million reports of ADRs from the US and worldwide;
however, a large proportion of reports in the database are from
the US [25]. The VigiBase consists of reports of adverse events
received since 1968 from more than 100 member countries. At
the time of this analysis, it contained over nine million reports
of ADRs worldwide [26]. In both SRS databases, the reports
originate from various sources including healthcare professionals, consumers and pharmaceutical manufacturers. The
adverse events are coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA), and patient narratives are not
included in the public version.
Events under study

The study focused on the 10 selected events that are deemed
important in pharmacovigilance practice, as identified by a
team of experts: acute liver injury; acute myocardial infarction;
acute renal failure; anaphylactic shock; bullous eruption; cardiac valve fibrosis; neutropenia; pancytopenia; rhabdomyolysis
and upper gastrointestinal bleeding [19]. Because of the large

heterogeneity in event coding between EHR databases in the
EU-ADR network, harmonization of event definitions was
required. The Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) concepts and related codes and labels corresponding to the
10 events were identified, and using these codes and terms,

database owners constructed their queries for the data extraction. The queries for the event data extraction from different
EHR databases were analyzed by a team of clinical experts and,
if necessary, were harmonized across all EHR databases. The
detailed process is described by Avillach et al. [27,28].

For the analyses in the SRS databases, the MedDRA dictionary including standardized MedDRA queries (SMQs) [version
11.1] was reviewed to identify MedDRA terms corresponding
to the UMLS concepts for the 10 events. An SMQ is a grouping of MedDRA terms that relate to a defined medical condition. If an SMQ was already available for an event of interest
then that SMQ was compared with the selected UMLS concepts to identify any missing MedDRA codes of interest. For
an adverse event that did not have a corresponding SMQ, the
complete MedDRA dictionary was reviewed to define custom
grouping of terms per UMLS concept (SUPPLEMENTARY APPENDIX 1
[supplementary material can be found online at www.informahealthcare.com/suppl/10.1586/17512433.2015.992878]).
Drugs under study

For comparison of drugs across EU-ADR and SRS databases,
a list of drugs that could be assessed in both EU-ADR system
98

and SRS databases was created, based on the following criteria: the use of the drug resulted in at least one exposed case
patient in EU-ADR with one or more of the 10 selected
events of interest; according to event-specific sample size calculations, the drug had a high enough exposure in EU-ADR
to be able to detect relative risk (RR) = 2 for each of the
events; the drug was not prescribed as part of a combination
therapy; the drug had at least one reported case in SRS. This
process yielded 404 drugs. The analyses in this study were
restricted to these 404 drugs. For each study drug, the drug
names as registered in the SRS were mapped to anatomic
therapeutic chemical (ATC) classification system, which was
used in EU-ADR.
Signal detection

In EU-ADR database network, the posterior expectation of the
incidence rate ratio [RR LGPS] was estimated for each drug–
event combination using the longitudinal Gamma Poisson shrinker
(LGPS) as a measure for signal detection [29]. All drug–event
combinations in which RR LGPS was ‡2 with p < 0.05 were
considered a signal, except if ‘Longitudinal Evaluation of
Observational Profiles of Adverse events Related to Drugs’
(LEOPARD) identified such an association as potentially due
to protopathic bias [14,29]. Protopathic bias is defined in this
context as a more general bias which reflects reversal of cause
and effect [30]. LEOPARD method detects and discards associations due to protopathic bias by comparing the rates of drug
prescriptions in a fixed window prior and after the occurrence
of an event [29].
The SRS analyses were carried out using a commercial software package (Empirica Signal System. Oracle, Waltham,
MA, USA). Data up to and including the second quarter of
2010 in FAERS and fourth quarter of 2010 in VigiBase database were utilized in this study. The Gamma Poisson Shrinker
was used to compute EB05, the fifth percentile of the empirical
Bayes posterior distribution, which corresponds roughly to the
lower point in a 90% confidence interval [31]. A threshold of
EB05 ‡2 was used to detect a signal. The threshold of
EB05 ‡2 was selected because of its extensive use in the pharmacovigilance practice [3].
Data analysis

The number of signals and proportion of signals out of total
number of drug–event combinations in the database were calculated across the EU-ADR and the SRS databases. In addition, the signals across all events for each database were
stratified and compared by the ATC codes using the first level,
anatomical main groups. In order to measure agreement
between data mining results from EU-ADR and SRS, all drug–
event combinations for each event under study were classified
using 2  2 table (TABLE 1). When a drug–event combination
was detected as a signal in both EU-ADR and SRS or if a
drug–event combination did not meet the threshold in both
EU-ADR and SRS, then the result for that drug–event combination was concordant. In contrast, when a drug–event

Review

combination was identified as a signal in EU-ADR but not in
SRS, or vice versa, then that drug–event combination result
was discordant. Kappa (k) statistics were calculated for each
event to measure the extent of agreement across the drugs studied. In signal detection data analysis, typically a large number
of drug–event combinations are screened to identify signals;
however, the proportion of drug–event combinations resulting
into signals is typically much smaller as compared to nonsignals (i.e., cell a in TABLE 1 is typically much less than 50%
of the sum of a+d ). In this situation, using only the kappa
value for interpretation of results would not be appropriate [32]. Therefore, we also calculated the proportion of positive agreement (Ppos) and proportion of negative agreement
(Pneg), prevalence index (Pindex), bias index (bindex) and
prevalence-adjusted bias-adjusted kappa (PABAK). PABAK is
a kappa adjusted for such imbalances in prevalence. The
magnitude of PABAK was interpreted using the Landis and
Koch scale: <= 0 = poor, 0.01–0.20 = slight, 0.21–0.40 =
fair, 0.41–0.60 = moderate, 0.61–0.80 = substantial and
0.81–1.00 = almost perfect [33].

Results

NEUTRO

For each event under study, the proportion of drug–event
combinations that resulted into a signal within the EU-ADR,
FAERS and VigiBase databases is shown in FIGURE 1. Overall,
across the 10 events, a higher proportion of drug–event combinations were identified as a signal in EU-ADR (22%) as compared to FAERS (12%) and VigiBase (9%). Acute renal failure
had the highest proportion (41% for EU-ADR; 21% for
FAERS; 12% for VigiBase). The lowest proportion was reported
for cardiac valve fibrosis (3% across all three databases). When
EU-ADR results were compared to those from FAERS, 10–20%
more signals were identified in EU-ADR for acute events such as
acute liver failure, acute renal failure, acute myocardial infarction,
neutropenia, pancytopenia and upper GI bleeding. The highest difference was noted for acute renal failure (21% in FAERS
and 41% in EU-ADR). A similar pattern but involving larger
differences was observed when EU-ADR data were compared
to VigiBase.
The measures of concordance between EU-ADR and SRS
are shown in the TABLES 2 & 3. The percentage of concordance
was moderate to high in all 10 events (59–94%). For both
EU-ADR/FAERS and EU-ADR/VigiBase comparisons, the
strength of concordance was highest for cardiac valve fibrosis
and anaphylactic shock and the lowest for acute liver failure
and acute renal failure. Despite the high percentage of concordance, low k was observed across all events. There was a high
proportion of negative agreement resulting in a substantial
imbalance in cells a and d in the 2  2 table. Therefore,
PABAK values were used for interpretation of strength of
agreement. The PABAK values were categorized as almost perfect for cardiac valve fibrosis and anaphylactic shock in both
EU-ADR/FAERS and EU-ADR/VigiBase comparisons. The
strength of concordance was slight and fair for acute renal failure and acute liver injury, respectively.

TABLES 4 & 5 present the frequency of drug–event combinations
that resulted in signals in either the EU-ADR or SRS, but not
in both. Of all drug-acute renal failure event combinations,
about 30–35% generated signals in the EU-ADR but not in a
SRS, while about 6–11 % of drug-acute renal failure combinations generated signals only in a SRS. Similarly, for acute liver
failure, about 21–25% of drugs generated a signal only in EUADR and about 8–11% of drugs generated signals only in a
SRS. In general, a higher number of signals were identified in
EU-ADR versus SRS.
For each database, the proportion of drug–event combinations that resulted into a signal across all events by the ATC
codes using the first level, anatomical main groups are presented in FIGURE 2. The proportion related to anti-infective for
systemic use (first level ATC Code J) was much higher in EUADR. Similar pattern was observed, however, in a lesser magnitude, in drugs classified to nervous system (first level ATC
Code N) and respiratory system (first level ATC code R).

Discussion

For the past 50 years, utilizing SRS for signal detection has
been a cornerstone of the pharmacovigilance practice. This is
the first study, of which we are aware, which has characterized
agreement of signal detection using EHRs from EU-ADR database network and SRS databases. The results of this study
show that general agreement exists between EU-ADR and SRS.
The frequency of concordance between EU-ADR and SRS
ranged from 59–94%. The greatest concordance between the
EU-ADR and SRS was in the detection of cardiac valve
fibrosis, anaphylactic shock, bullous eruptions and acute
myocardial infarctions. Cardiac valve fibrosis has been known
to be associated with the use of dopamine agonists for the
treatment of Parkinson’s disease, and clinicians are alert to
the potential for ADR and reporting may be more uniform [34–36]. Anaphylactic shock, bullous eruptions and acute
myocardial infarctions are readily diagnosed as well as significant events. The other events may take longer to develop,
require more testing and may not be as readily identifiable as
drug-induced events. Reporting bias is a recognized weakness
of SRS data and may result in underreporting in general or
over-reporting of publicized events. These factors may
account for the differences in concordance of results between
EU-ADR and SRS.
The number of signals identified by EU-ADR and SRS was
similar for so-called ‘hallmark’ drug-induced events (anaphylactic shock and bullous eruption) and for those events that have
been highly publicized and causally linked to a drug (acute
100

myocardial infarction, rhabdomyolysis or cardiac valve fibrosis).
For events falling outside of these criteria and those found in
high frequency in the general population, a larger percentage
of signals were found in the EU-ADR database compared to
SRS databases. These events included acute liver injury, acute
renal failure, UGIB and neutropenia. These findings support
the idea that data mining the EU-ADR system may be useful
to detect hallmark drug toxicities as well as events that occur
frequently in the general population.
There may be inconsistencies and underreporting associated
with the data collected within the SRS. They are collected with
assumption of causality between a drug and an event and are
highly dependent on reporter’s ability to recognize such and
their priority to report. However, in electronic health records
databases, such as EU-ADR, regular practice, prescription and
test data are collected, irrespective of their relationship to
adverse events. This could facilitate identification of signals for
events that are likely to be confounded by many underlying
factors, resulting in difficulty for a reporter to identify a causal
link and also underreporting of events that are not deemed
‘important’ in the eyes of the reporter.
When data were evaluated by ATC code, for codes J, N and
R the higher number of signals were identified in EU-ADR
compared to SRS. Code J consists of anti-infective for systemic
use. These are used frequently in the general population. Similarly, code N and R consist of medications related to nervous
system and respiratory system, respectively. There could be two
possible reasons for these significant differences in proportion
between EU-ADR and SRS. First, prescription medications are
recorded in the health records databases irrespective of their
relationship to adverse events. Second, medications belonging
to these ATC codes are prescribed for illnesses that are usually
occurring in a higher frequency in the general population.
Since in the EU-ADR data, human intervention was not required for reporting signals associated with these drug–event
combinations, it is not surprising to observe a higher proportion in EU-ADR compared to SRS as potentially due to residual confounding. Further research should focus on evaluating
ATC data at more drill-down level and also by event.
There were several limitations to this study, mainly related
to the heterogeneity between SRS and EU-ADR systems. SRS
contain a mix of European and non-European reports. The
EU-ADR data was all European data. Also, the SRS data used
MedDRA as an event coding dictionary, while EU-ADR data
were originally coded using the local database coding practices.
Thus, differences in medical practice, clinical judgment, cultural parameters, population characteristics and event coding
practices could have had an impact on the study results. In
addition, the scope of the study was limited to 10 events and
404 drugs. As a consequence, the findings may not be generalizable to a broader range of drug–event combinations. Nevertheless, the selected events are diverse in terms of incidence,
prevalence, severity and disease onset.
Since the 10 selected events were deemed important in
the pharmacovigilance practice, it made harmonization of the

Using real-world healthcare data for pharmacovigilance signal detection

definitions easier and achievable. In the future research, it
would be helpful to see if the same came be achieved for other
events and the impact of any coding differences on the results.
It is important to note that the focus of this study was not
to compare performance of statistical algorithms utilized by each
databases, but rather to measure and compare agreement in signal generation by data mining EU-ADR and SRS databases, in
a setting akin to real-world pharmacovigilance practice. For SRS,
the data mining algorithm and threshold (EB05 ‡2) were
selected because of their extensive use and validation in pharmacovigilance practice. The RR-LGPS method was use in the EUADR analysis, as it was found to be the best method for signal
detection using EHRs [14,29]. The threshold used for RR-LGPS is
interpreted similar to EBGM. There are several other data mining algorithms that are utilized in the pharmacovigilance practice
for SRS databases, but they were not included in this study. It
would be helpful to replicate this study and understand the
results using other data mining algorithms.
Our conclusions indicate that utilizing EHR for signal detection, such as the EU-ADR system might complement SRS in
signal detection, particularly with events occurring at high frequency in the general population and those that are perceived
as unlikely to be drug induced. As EHR data are getting more
accessible, a reviewer could use SRS as a first screening tool
to detect signals and then utilize EHR data for selected
drug–event combinations to further substantiate a signal.

Review

Signal detection in both EU-ADR and SRS systems would
strengthen current signal detection activities by decreasing the
influences of systematic bias when using one system. Further
studies may clarify the possible advantages of signal detection
using administrative claims and EHR databases as secondary
data sources.

Key issues
.

The increasing availability of electronic healthcare records offers important opportunities to investigate a wide spectrum of adverse drug
reactions and to detect drug safety signals closer to real use and time as these types of databases record information for large populations and for long follow-up periods.

.

The EU-ADR project, which ran between 2008 and 2013, led to the alliance of different administrative/claims and general practice
databases, creating a resource of unprecedented size for drug safety monitoring in Europe (around 30 million persons from seven different databases) and aimed at utilizing these data for the early detection of adverse drug reactions.

.

The EU-ADR system may have a greater potential for detecting signals for events occurring at higher frequency in general population
and those that are commonly not considered as potentially a drug-induced event.

.

Signal detection in both EU-ADR and spontaneous reporting system would strengthen current signal detection activities by decreasing
the influences of systematic bias when using one system.
