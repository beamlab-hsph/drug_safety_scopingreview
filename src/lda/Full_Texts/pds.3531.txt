ABSTRACT
Purpose The aim of this study was to develop an automated causality assessment algorithm to identify drug-induced liver injury.
Methods The Roussel Uclaf Causality Assessment Method (RUCAM) is an algorithm for determining the causal association between a
drug and liver injury. In collaboration with hepatology experts, deﬁnitions were developed for the RUCAM criteria to operationalize an
electronic RUCAM (eRUCAM). The eRUCAM was tested in a population of patients taking 14 drugs with a characteristic phenotype for
liver injury. Quality assurance for programming speciﬁcations involved comparisons between scores generated by the eRUCAM, for
probable and highly probable cases, and expert manual RUCAM (n = 20). Concordance between eRUCAM and manual RUCAM subscores
and total score was tested using the Wilcoxon signed rank test.
Results Causality scores were the same for 6 of 20 patients (30%) by manual and eRUCAM algorithms. Analysis of subscores revealed
≥80% concordance between manual and eRUCAM for ﬁve of the seven criteria. In general, the total scores tended to be higher for the
eRUCAM compared with the manual RUCAM. Programming issues were identiﬁed for criterion 5 ‘non-drug causes of liver injury’ where
signiﬁcant differences existed between manual and eRUCAM scoring (p = 0.001). For criterion 5, identical scores occurred in 9 of 20
patients (45%), and manual review identiﬁed additional codes, timing criteria, and laboratory results for improving subsequent eRUCAM
revisions.
Conclusion The eRUCAM had generally good concordance with manual RUCAM scoring. These preliminary ﬁndings suggest that the
eRUCAM algorithm is feasible and could have application in clinical practice and drug safety surveillance. Copyright © 2013 John Wiley

INTRODUCTION
Drug-induced liver injury is the most frequent cause of
acute liver failure in the USA, resulting in 600 liver
transplants and over 100 deaths annually.1,2 More than
300 drugs have been associated with drug-induced liver
injury, with manifestations varying from asymptomatic
liver enzyme elevations to fulminant liver failure.3 The

most common drugs causing severe drug-induced liver
injury include acetaminophen, antimicrobials, anti-epileptics, psychotropics, and antimetabolites.4 Despite
measures to identify liver safety issues during drug
development, most severe drug-induced liver injury is
identiﬁed post-marketing. Thus, the burden falls on
health care providers or post-marketing surveillance to
identify cases of drug-induced liver injury.
In practice, primary care physicians and hospitalists
frequently misdiagnose drug-induced liver injury,
resulting in diagnostic delays, prolonged exposure to
the drug, and potential complications for patients.5 One
reason is that drug-induced liver injury is generally a diagnosis of exclusion requiring other causes of liver injury

to be ruled out before a drug cause is considered likely. In
1993, international experts developed the Roussel Uclaf
Causality Assessment Method (RUCAM) for identifying
drug-induced liver injury.6 This simple causality scoring
system accurately identiﬁes drug-induced liver injury and
generally correlates well with expert review.7,8 Some
studies have reported low correlation between RUCAM
and expert assessment and large inter-observer and
intra-observer variability when using RUCAM.9,10
However, the RUCAM was recently endorsed by experts
for causality assessment of drug-induced liver injury
because of its sound evidence base.11
To identify drug-induced liver injury in the postmarketing setting, new systems and processes need
to be developed. These systems need to be robust to
allow identiﬁcation using health care data or for use
within an electronic medical record (EMR). A recent
study established the feasibility of using computer
algorithms to identify possible drug-induced liver
injury in an EMR.12
The methodology has been further developed in this
study to include a causality assessment component
based on RUCAM criteria. We report here on the
development of an electronic RUCAM (eRUCAM)
causality assessment algorithm for drug-induced liver
injury and its pilot testing in a population of patients
receiving medications associated with hepatotoxicity.
METHODS
eRUCAM algorithm methodology
The eRUCAM algorithm was developed using data
formatted in conformance with the Observational
Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) common
data model.13 We selected this publically available
data model because the OMOP common data model
was developed to support research involving the
standardized detection of adverse drug effects, and
it contains all of the data ﬁelds required by
eRUCAM. The eRUCAM incorporates a modular
design with each of seven modules focusing on
one of the RUCAM criteria (Table 1 has a listing
of the seven criteria). Subscores are generated for
each criterion and summed to yield a total
eRUCAM score, which provides the likelihood of
drug-induced liver injury. Total scores are grouped
as follows: highly probable (>8 points), probable
(6–8 points), possible (3–5 points), unlikely (1–2
points), or excluded (≤0 points). To operationalize
the deﬁnitions for eRUCAM and maintain consistency with current thinking on causality assessment
for drug-induced liver injury, we engaged in discussions with an expert panel of hepatologists. The

programming steps are described here with additional detail in the appendix.
Initial screening. The ﬁrst step to the eRUCAM
algorithm is the identiﬁcation of drug exposures
and screening for elevated liver enzymes (alanine aminotransferase [ALT] and alkaline phosphatase [ALKP])
temporally associated with drug initiation. The second
step identiﬁes the liver injury type (hepatocellular,
cholestatic, or mixed) based on liver enzyme results
drawn within 24 hours of each other. The type of liver
injury was determined as follows:11

•

Hepatocellular: ALT ≥5 times upper limits of
normal (5× ULN) and R ≥ 5
• Cholestatic: ALKP ≥ 2× ULN and R ≤ 2
• Mixed: ALT ≥ 5x ULN, ALKP ≥ ULN and 2 < R < 5
where R = [ALT value/ALT ULN]/[ALKP value/ALKP
ULN]
Muscle injury and alcoholic hepatitis are associated
with ALT and aspartate aminotransferase (AST)
elevations.14,15 To minimize inclusion of muscle
injury, patients are not scored if their creatine
phosphokinase or lactate dehydrogenase is greater
than 5× ULN at the time of ALT or AST elevation;
to exclude alcoholic hepatitis, the AST was required
to be lower than the ALT at the initial scoring.
Criterion 1: time between the drug start and liver enzyme
elevations. Drug-induced liver injury generally occurs
in the ﬁrst 90 days following drug initiation or 30 days
post-cessation.3,11 Liver enzyme elevations within this
window of time receive more points. The drug start
date is deﬁned as the prescription dispensed date. Liver
enzyme elevations must occur after the drug start date,
and at least one of the liver enzyme elevations during
follow-up needed to meet the ALT or ALKP threshold

drug-induced liver injury automated assessment

for deﬁning the type of injury. The date of the ﬁrst liver
enzyme elevation meeting the threshold criteria deﬁned
the start of the liver injury for timing purposes.

Criterion 2: time to resolution of liver enzyme
elevation once the drug is stopped. Criterion 2
examines the decline in serum liver enzyme levels
over time following drug discontinuation.16 The
percentage reduction is calculated on the basis of the
difference between peak ALT (or ALKP for
cholestatic and mixed injury) and the ULN. If the drug
stop date is unknown, it is deﬁned as the date of the
ﬁrst elevated liver enzyme test. Patients who receive
a subsequent prescription for the same drug, by
deﬁnition, have not stopped therapy and are scored
accordingly.

Criterion 3: risk factors for drug-induced liver
injury. Risk factors for drug-induced liver injury
include age (≥55), pregnancy, and alcohol use.6 Age
is determined on the date liver enzyme elevations are
ﬁrst noted. Coexistent pregnancy is deﬁned on the
basis of International Classiﬁcation of Diseases, 9th
edition (ICD-9) diagnosis and Current Procedural
Terminology procedure codes, and alcohol use is
based on ICD-9 codes for alcohol abuse, and laboratory results indicating an elevated mean corpuscular
volume (The codes for alcohol abuse and pregnancy
are provided in the appendix).

Criterion 4: concomitant medication usage and
timing. Criterion 4 assesses the usage and timing of
concomitant medications that are associated with liver
injury. Points are deducted if the concomitant medication(s) and liver enzyme elevations meet the temporal
association as deﬁned in Criterion 1.
For Criterion 4 scoring several steps were undertaken to develop a list of concomitant medications.
In the ﬁrst step, a list of medications known to be
associated with drug-induced liver injury was
generated from literature and expert review.3,17 Only
those drugs with a high empirical Bayes geometric
mean (EBGM ≥ 2.0) disproportionality score for
drug-induced liver injury reporting in the FDA adverse
event reporting system data were considered.18
Second, a listing of the 100 most commonly prescribed drugs in the USA was created. The ﬁnal list
of drugs for criterion 4 consisted of the intersection

of the two lists; drugs commonly prescribed in the
USA with an elevated disproportionality score
EBGM ≥ 2.0 for liver injury reporting. Other concomitant exposures such as toxic mushrooms were identiﬁed by ICD-9 codes.
Criteria 5: non-drug causes of liver injury. Criterion
5 identiﬁes non-drug causes of liver injury, which are
separated into primary and secondary causes using
diagnosis codes. The probability of drug-induced liver
injury is lower in the presence of primary or secondary
causes so points are deducted. The timing of non-drug
causes and the start of liver injury is also important for
scoring purposes so timeframes are speciﬁed. Table 2
lists the primary and secondary causes of hepatotoxicity as implemented in eRUCAM.

Criterion 6: known information about the hepatotoxic
potential of the drug. Criterion 6 adds points based on
information about the suspect drug and its association
with drug-induced liver injury from US prescribing
information or published case reports. No good source
was found for US prescribing information so the
Spanish drug-induced liver injury registry was used
to specify drugs with published data indicating the
potential for liver injury.3,17

Criterion 7: liver enzyme elevations with drug
rechallenge/re-administration. Criterion 7 examines
the presence or absence of liver enzyme elevations
following drug re-administration (rechallenge) after
the initial liver injury. Recurrent liver injury following

to starting the drug. In addition, patients were required
to have ﬁlled at least one prescription for any drug
during the prior 12 months.
Pilot chart review

Study setting
The eRUCAM algorithm was tested on EMR data
from Kaiser Permanente Southern California (KPSC).
KPSC is a nonproﬁt, group-model managed care
organization providing integrated healthcare services
to approximately 3.4 million members. The KPSC
membership closely mirrors the overall Southern
California population.19 The EMR system documents
all healthcare encounters. Detailed data are available
for research purposes and includes patient demographics, prescription dispensing history, diagnosis
and procedure codes associated with healthcare
encounters, and laboratory test results. The IRB waived
the requirement for informed consent.
Study population
For the initial eRUCAM pilot testing, patients who ﬁlled
one or more prescriptions for drugs known to cause liver
injury between 1 January 2003 and 31 August 2011
were identiﬁed. These study drugs included 13 drugs
frequently associated with drug-induced liver injury in
the USA and aripiprazole, which has recently been
associated with serious hepatic disorders (Table 3).20,21
Patients needed to be 18 years or older at the time the
drug was started and have 12 months of continuous

10 000 patient
exposures

Twenty cases of possible or probable drug-induced
liver injury (based on eRUCAM scoring) were
randomly selected for chart abstraction and adjudication to identify areas for algorithm improvement and
to perform quality assurance. The objective was to
beta-test the eRUCAM algorithm. The 20 abstracted
and de-identiﬁed charts were reviewed by a board
certiﬁed hepatologist (CMH) to generate a manual
RUCAM score, which served as the gold standard.
To minimize the capture of liver injury unrelated to
the study drugs, a relatively healthy population was
selected. Excluded from chart review were the
following: (1) patients with a diagnosis of liver disease
or comorbidity that could cause liver enzyme
elevations in the 12 months prior to the index date;
(2) patients with elevated liver enzyme tests in the
12 months prior to the index date; and (3) patients with
concomitant medications [other than the 14 study
drugs] potentially associated with liver injury.
Statistical analysis
Descriptive characteristics of the total exposed
population as well as patient characteristics for the
potential drug-induced liver injury population are
reported. Unadjudicated rates of probable and highly
probable liver injury events by eRUCAM were
calculated per 10 000 exposures. For the 20 adjudicated cases, comparisons were made between the ‘gold
standard’ manual RUCAM and eRUCAM scores
using the Wilcoxon signed rank test. The concordance
between the manual RUCAM and eRUCAM was
calculated as the proportion of cases for which the
two methods yielded identical causality groupings.
RESULTS
Between 1 January 2003 and 31 August 2011, a total
of 1 239 071 patients received 3 321 835 study drug
exposures. Four antibiotics (ciproﬂoxacin, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, nitrofurantoin, and amoxicillin/clavulanate) accounted for 89.4% of the
exposures. Across all study drug exposures, the
eRUCAM algorithm identiﬁed 14 925 potential druginduced liver injury events (in 11 109 patients). The
average age of the 11 109 patients was 59.7 years and
54.5% were women. The racial distribution was as

follows: 44.5% White, 23.2% Hispanic, 10.2% Black,
5.9% Asian, and 16.2% other/unknown. The most
common type of liver injury was cholestatic 65.0%,
followed by hepatocellular 29.4%, and mixed 5.6%.
In assessing causality between drug exposure and
drug-induced liver injury (n = 14 925), the eRUCAM
categorized 15.5% as probable or highly probable,
59.6% as possible, and 24.9% as unlikely related to
the drug. The overall rate of probable or highly
probable events was 6.9 cases per 10 000 exposures.
Table 3 lists the unadjudicated rates of probable and
highly probable events (n = 2311) per 10 000 exposures
by drug; the highest rates occurred with isoniazid and
phenytoin.
The frequencies of possible scores under each of
the criteria are reported in Table 4. The eRUCAM
results for criteria 1 to 4 and 7 spanned the entire
range of possible scores, and there were no obvious
ﬂoor or ceiling effects. Scores for criterion 6 were
ﬁxed at 2 because the 14 drugs are known to cause
liver injury. Only two of six possible Criterion 5
scores were generated by the eRUCAM with the vast
majority of scores being zero, suggesting that the
eRUCAM algorithm, as it was initially programmed,
was not able to discern other non-drug causes of liver
injury where negative points are awarded or in cases
where other non-drug causes are ruled out and positive points are awarded.
The pilot chart review included the following study
drugs: isoniazid (n = 7), ciproﬂoxacin (n = 6), trimethoprim/sulfomethoxazole (n = 4), and one each for
diclofenac, nitrofurantoin, and phenytoin. Overall
there was 30% (6/20) concordance for causality between the manual RUCAM and the eRUCAM with
concordance occurring for two probable/highly probable cases and four possible cases (Figure 1).

605

Overall the total scores tended to be higher for the
eRUCAM compared with the manual RUCAM. Comparisons were made between the eRUCAM and manual RUCAM subscores for each of the seven criteria
(Table 5). With ﬁve of the seven criteria, the RUCAM
scores generated by manual review and the eRUCAM
were identical at 80% or more of the time. The 100%
concordance for criterion 6 reﬂects the selection of
drugs used for this analysis, which are all known to
cause liver injury. With criterion 5, only 9 of 20
(45%) cases received identical scores by both
methods. Differences between the manual and electronic methods were found in the following situations:
(1) patients with isolated elevations in ALKP where
the eRUCAM did not account for bone fractures or
bone metastases; (2) diagnoses of biliary obstruction
as a cause for elevated liver enzymes falling outside
the pre-speciﬁed time windows, which were therefore
not counted by eRUCAM; or (3) patients with severe
multi-organ failure, or sepsis, and hypotension that
were not captured by eRUCAM.
Another programming issue involving criterion 4
(concomitant medications) was revealed on chart review. Initially, a shortened list of 100 commonly used
drugs with liver injury potential was selected for
inclusion. However, several drugs associated with
liver injury were not included on the initial list (rifampin, isotretinoin, erythromycin, and carbamazepine)
and therefore not scored correctly by eRUCAM.
DISCUSSION
In this study, an automated eRUCAM causality
assessment algorithm, for identifying drug-induced
liver injury, was developed and tested in EMR data.
Our results suggest that it is feasible to create an

identical 45% of the time, and only two of the six
possible scores were generated by eRUCAM.
Chart abstractions revealed a number of programming
issues not considered in the initial eRUCAM
development. With criterion 5, these issues included the
following: (1) reliance exclusively on ICD-9 codes for
deﬁning other causes without consideration of
laboratory test results [speciﬁcally Hepatitis and viral
disease testing]; (2) an incomplete listing of potential
ICD-9 codes; and (3) the inability to obtain information
from text ﬁelds. Additional issues were identiﬁed with
Criterion 4, which only considered the most commonly
prescribed drugs with elevated EBGM scores for
inclusion, and as a result, some important drugs were
missing from the concomitant drug list. Lastly, Criterion
3 included an elevated mean corpuscular volume (MCV)
as an indicator for alcohol abuse but many other diseases
associated with elevated MCV were found on chart
review rendering this deﬁnition unworkable.
Use of the internationally endorsed and validated
RUCAM, with input from an expert panel of
hepatologists to operationalize deﬁnitions and provide
programming recommendations for the criteria was a
key strength for developing the eRUCAM. RUCAM
is the “gold standard” to objectively and accurately
assess causality for drug-induced liver injury and is
endorsed by many hepatologists, researchers, and
regulatory authorities.22 Another strength of our
approach was conducting preliminary comparisons
between the eRUCAM and manual RUCAM. These
comparisons revealed concordance for most criteria,
verifying algorithm programming, and identifying
areas for future improvement. An additional strength
was eRUCAM’s uses of the publically available
OMOP common data model, which enables others to
test and further develop the algorithm.
Several limitations need to be considered when
interpreting these results. First, the eRUCAM has only

drug-induced liver injury automated assessment

been tested at one site (KPSC) and further testing and
validation is needed. The goal is to make eRUCAM
publically available through OMOP allowing others to
test and develop the algorithm. Second, for the pilot chart
abstraction, only possible and probable/highly probable
charts were selected. This was performed to examine
the coding decisions, but a broader range of charts needs
to be reviewed in future efforts. Another limitation of the
eRUCAM methodology is that it is restricted to
information that is easily obtained from EMR data
(diagnosis and procedure codes, prescriptions, and
laboratories). There is information in the text ﬁelds
(progress notes, consults, and procedure ﬁndings) of the
EMR that can supplement diagnosis codes such as
information on alcohol use, pregnancy, and alternative
causes of liver injury that are available to an expert
clinician during chart review. The use of natural language
processing methodologies to mine these text ﬁelds for
important key words and phrases is another area of
investigation that could improve the capabilities of the
eRUCAM causality assessment tool.23 Another potential
area for future work includes reﬁning the seven RUCAM
criteria and tailoring the algorithm parameters with a
determination of appropriate weighting for each criteria
based on statistical evaluations.
Our preliminary ﬁndings suggest that the eRUCAM
causality assessment tool shows promise in identifying
clinically important drug-induced liver injury events.
With additional revisions and testing, the eRUCAM
could provide the appropriate balance of sensitivity
and speciﬁcity to aid in identifying liver injury in
clinical and drug safety surveillance settings. In
clinical settings, the eRUCAM could potentially be
linked to an EMR and provide alerts to providers
regarding possible drug-induced liver injuries,
prompting further investigation into causes of elevated
liver enzymes. For drug safety, the eRUCAM could be
implemented into prospective surveillance systems to
aid in the identiﬁcation of potential drug-induced liver
injury events. For example, the FDA Sentinel Initiative could employ an algorithm like the eRUCAM to
monitor safety and identify signals for further
evaluation.24 In conclusion, the eRUCAM causality
assessment tool can potentially be used to detect
drug-induced liver injury in the clinic and in drug
safety surveillance. Further reﬁnement and expanded
use of the tool could enhance clinical practice and
safety surveillance.
