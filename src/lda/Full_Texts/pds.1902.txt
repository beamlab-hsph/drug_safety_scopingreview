SUMMARY
Purpose To detect adverse drug reaction (ADR) signals of rosuvastatin compared to other statins with a novel data-mining approach based on
relative risk (RR) using the national health insurance claims database, and to evaluate the usefulness of this method as a tool for signal detection.
Methods We used the Health Insurance Review & Assessment Service (HIRA) claims database (Seoul, Korea). Serious adverse events
(SAE) were defined as any diagnostic code at the time of hospitalization within 12 weeks from a statin prescription date, regardless of
causality. Among statin users, RRs were calculated to compare the proportion of rosuvastatin-specific SAE pairs for rosuvastatin users with
the corresponding proportion of drug-SAE pairs for users of other statins. Any SAE for which the lower limit of the RR’s 95% confidence
interval was greater than 1 was defined as a signal. All detected signals were reviewed to determine whether the signals corresponded with
published adverse events (AEs) exclusive to rosuvastatin.
Results Among 96 236 elderly outpatients who received rosuvastatin, or other statins, from January 2005 to September 2005, 40 304 drugSAE pairs and 376 SAEs were observed. Twenty-five (6.6%) SAEs were detected as signals by the RR-based data-mining approach. Among
the 13 references AEs published to be exclusive to rosuvastatin, 8 (61.5%) were found to correspond with the detected signals with a positive
predictive value (PPV) of 32%.
Conclusions The RR-based data-mining approach successfully detected signals for rosuvastatin using a national health insurance claims
database. This approach could be useful for safety surveillance of marketed products. Copyright # 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Such approaches compare the observed count for a
drug-event combination with an expected count based
on the relative frequency of events occurring for the
drug alone and the event alone.4–9 Although this is
generally considered to be a useful method for
identifying unknown or rare adverse drug reactions
(ADRs), spontaneous reporting has some problems.
There is usually a lack of denominator data, such as
data of the user population and drug exposure data, and
a significant underreporting with this method.3,5 In
addition, it is difficult to minimize indication bias and
to ensure the comparability of ADRs between targeted

SIGNAL DETECTION OF ROSUVASTATIN

drug user and control groups (or reference group).
Recently, duplicate case reports has been recognized as
another important data quality problem.10
Large healthcare administrative databases, on the
other hand, contain longitudinal medical records,
including diagnoses, drug prescriptions, hospital
admissions, and laboratory results.11 When using
this type of database, duplicate records can be
overcome by looking at person- or type-specific ADR
information. Furthermore, these databases, which do
not rely only on the reporting of adverse events
(AEs), have great potential to provide information on
real-world drug AEs and to detect unrecognized or
underappreciated AE signals compared to spontaneous ADR reporting databases.11–13 However, a
relevant approach should be developed to focus
specifically on safety signal detection using a viable
database. Previous studies have not attempted to
evaluate if a novel data-mining approach based on
relative risk (RR) using healthcare databases could
effectively assist with signal detection.
Recently, the use of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors
(statins) has been increasing rapidly.14 In Korea, statins
are prescription-only drugs and all details of their use
are collected in the national health claims database.
Rosuvastatin is the most recently introduced statin in
Korea, as in many other countries.15 Newly introduced
drugs should be evaluated for their absolute safety as
well as their safety relative to existing drugs. Therefore, rosuvastatin was selected as an example drug for
signal detection.
This study was performed to detect signals resulting
from use of the newly introduced drug, rosuvastatin,
compared to those of other statins, by a data-mining
method using RR in the Korean national health
insurance claims database. Secondly, a positive
predictive value (PPV) for RR was estimated to
validate the usefulness of this approach.
METHODS
Data source
The Korean Health Insurance Review & Assessment
Service (HIRA) database was used in this study.
Under the National Health Insurance System,
Koreans are entitled to medical coverage as either
an employee or a member of a community.
Healthcare providers are required to submit reports
on medical services provided under the health
insurance policies to HIRA for a review of the
medical costs incurred. Accordingly, the HIRA
database contains information on all claims including

prescribed medications for approximately 50 million
Koreans.16 We requested the claims data for elderly
patients (aged 65 years or older) that had been
submitted by healthcare providers based in Seoul
during 1 January 2005 to 31 December 2005.
According to the Act on the Protection of Personal
Information Maintained by Public Agencies, HIRA
prepared the claims data concealing the individual
identity. This study was, therefore, exempt from
review by the Institutional Review Board of the Seoul
National University College of Medicine. The
database we received included an unidentifiable
code representing each individual together with
age, gender, diagnosis, and a list of prescribed drugs.
Drug information included the brand name, generic
name, prescription date, and duration and route of
administration. Diagnoses were coded according to
the Internal Classification of Disease, Tenth Revision
(ICD-10). The database contained information
regarding 1 093 262 elderly patients and 11 842 586
prescriptions.
Study subjects
The study population consisted of elderly ambulatory
care patients in Seoul who received rosuvastatin, or
other statins including lovastatin, simvastatin, atorvastatin, fluvastatin, pravastatin, and pitavastatin
from 1 January 2005 to 30 September 2005.
Generally, drug safety data are limited in this group
because elderly patients with/without comorbidities
are usually excluded from clinical trials. Only elderly
patients were included to avoid the confounding
effect of age.
Definitions of drug exposure and drug-SAE pairs
Rosuvastatin was selected as the target drug for
detecting AE signals, and other statins were used as a
comparative reference group. Likewise, the study
subjects were thus divided into rosuvastatin users and
users of other statins.
A serious adverse event (SAE) was defined as a
hospital admission within 12 weeks from the first
observed statin prescription date during the study
period. SAEs were identified from the study population
database and diagnoses (three-character ICD-10
code) at the time of these events. Patients who were
prescribed rosuvastatin in addition to other statins
during the study period were considered as rosuvastatin
users as well as ‘other statins’ users (assigned to both
groups for analysis). In this case, the first observed

individual drug prescription dates were used. The
12-week window period was chosen based on the
methodology of previous studies using the same
definition for AEs associated with statin use.17,18
Drug-SAE pairs, consisting of the prescribed statin and
one of each diagnostic code at the time of hospitalization, were generated for each patient. Each drugSAE pair was counted once for each patient. If a patient
had several identical drug-SAE pairs, these pairs were
considered as one to reduce bias due to multiple
repairing (Figure 1).
Definition of signal
Two-by-two tables were created by combining the
frequency of drug-SAE pairs with the estimated RR for
each SAE. RR, a ratio of the risk in exposed individuals
to that in unexposed individuals, is used here as a datamining index. More specifically, we used RR to
compare the proportion of rosuvastatin-specific SAE
pairs (N1) from the total number of patients prescribed
rosuvastatin (T1) with the proportion of other statin
SAE pairs (N0) from the total number of patients
prescribed other statins (T0). Patients who were
prescribed rosuvastatin as well as other statins during
the study period were considered to be in both the
rosuvastatin user group (T1) and the ‘other statins’ user
group (T0). This leads to the definition of RR as
RR ¼ ðN1 =T1 Þ=ðN0 =T0 Þ

SAE was defined as a signal for rosuvastatin where
the lower limit of the RR’s 95% confidence interval is
greater than 1.

Validation of RR-based data-mining approach
We analyzed if the detected signals were published
AEs of rosuvastatin. We used the published AEs
included in 2008 UpToDate1 Drug Information
Database, as the reference literature source, which
provides comprehensive lists of AEs, including those
that are recognized and suspected. The published AEs
of statins were classified as either ‘rosuvastatinspecific AEs’, consisting of AEs exclusive to
rosuvastatin, or ‘AEs of all other statins’, which
includes all remaining published AEs. Box 1 shows the
13 rosuvastatin-specific AEs and the 140 AEs of all
other statins.

Two clinical experts independently compared the
detected signals against the lists of published AEs.
When the experts evaluated the detected signals, they
were offered only the lists of detected signals as ICD10 codes with names of the diseases and the lists of
the published statins’ AEs without the classification
information i.e., rosuvastatin-specific or not. We
delivered the sheets separately to the evaluators and
asked them to compare the detected signals and the
lists of published AEs independently from each other.
All detected signals were reviewed to determine if the
signals were identical to the published AEs or if they
were symptomatically related to the published AEs.

signals and the published AEs was categorized as
matched, relevant, or irrelevant. For example, if
hypertension was detected as a signal, it would be
considered a ‘matched signal’ since hypertension is
also listed in the reference. The detection of toxic
liver disease as a signal was categorized as a ‘relevant
signal’ because increased alanine aminotransferase
and jaundice are both listed in the reference, and
these features can be seen due to toxic liver disease.
All detected signals were assessed independently and
blindly by two evaluators who were not informed of
the classification of rosuvastatin-specific or other
statin AEs. In addition before we calculated interobserver kappa values, the evaluators were unaware
of each other’s results. The degree of inter-observer
agreement was excellent (k ¼ 0.82, p < 0.001), and
any disagreements were resolved by consensus. We
then validated the index of RRs by calculating the
proportion of detected signals that were consistent
with the reference published AEs exclusive to
rosuvastatin relative to the total number of detected
signals. In addition, we calculated the PPV by
dividing the total number of the signals coincident
with published AEs by the total number of detected
signals.
RESULTS
We identified a total of 103 079 elderly ambulatory
care patients from the HIRA database who had
received statin prescriptions in Seoul between 1
January 2005 and 30 September 2005 (Figure 2).
Their mean age [standard deviation (SD)] was 71.0

prescribed statins included simvastatin (51.4%),
atorvastatin (20.3%), and lovastatin (15.4%)
(Table 1). In terms of medication(s) used, 7049 were
taking rosuvastatin, 98 517 were using other statins,
and 2487 (2.7%) were taking a combination of
rosuvastatin and other statins and were sorted into
both groups. A total of 21 939 patients were admitted to
the hospital within 12 weeks from initially having been
prescribed a statin. The RR-based data-mining
approach generated 40 304 drug-SAE pairs and 376
different SAE. Frequently observed diagnoses, according to ICD-10 codes, were diseases related to the
circulatory system (11.2%), digestive system (9.8%),
and neoplasms (8.8%) (Table 2).

ET AL.

A total of 25 SAEs were detected as signals of
rosuvastatin through the application of RR, regardless
of causality. Table 3 shows a list of the detected signals,
the incidence of SAEs among rosuvastatin users, the
value of RR, and the correlation between detected
signals and published AEs from the reference
literature. Identified signals included iron deficiency
anemia, thyrotoxicosis, hypertension, angina pectoris,
chronic ischemic heart disease, vasomotor and allergic
rhinitis, adult respiratory distress syndrome, gastroenteritis and colitis, and toxic liver disease (Table 3).
Among the 13 rosuvastatin-specific AEs, 8 (61.5%)
matched the detected signals (Table 4). Of 25 signals
detected by the RR-based data-mining approach, eight
corresponded with rosuvastatin-specific AEs with a
PPV of 32%. When detected signals were compared to
other statin-specific or shared list of AEs from the
reference literature, 18 signals corresponded. The PPV
was estimated to be 80%.
DISCUSSION
This study shows that a RR-based data-mining
approach, using a health insurance claims database,
can be used to detect drug safety signals. The findings
suggest that the HIRA database is a viable resource
for the safety surveillance of marketed medicinal
products. By evaluating the agreement between
detected signals and previously published AEs listed
in the reference literature, it was possible to evaluate
the predictability of the data-mining approach. As a
result, we detected approximately 60% of the
published AEs exclusive to rosuvastatin, and the
PPV was relatively high. This result indicates that RR

In this study, the RR principle was applied to the
data-mining approach, making the results easy to
interpret and analyze. We selected a lower 95%
confidence limit for an RR of 1.0 as a filter for signal
detection, which is similar to the criteria of other datamining indices such as the reporting odds ratio (ROR)
and the proportional reporting ratio (PRR). The
Medical Controls Agency uses a threshold for drug–
AE combinations of PRR 2 and a x2 test value (with 1
degree of freedom) of 4 and the presence of three or
more cases 6 to highlight potential signals. The LAREB
foundation in the Netherlands uses a ROR -1.96SE >0
as their threshold.20 More sensitive results could be
obtained using more sensitive criteria such as a lower
confidence limit of 90%, though this may depend partly
on the purpose or requirements of the application.
Therefore, further study should be conducted to
determine the most suitable criteria.
Evaluation should continue to detect more signals
not listed among the published AEs. Our finding
should be interpreted carefully. First, the HIRA
database is based on the ICD-10 diagnostic classification system, which differs from other AE
reporting systems such as the WHO Adverse
Reaction Terminology, in terms of vocabulary,
classification, and nomenclature. A list of published
AEs can be created by collecting data from an ADR
reporting database or from clinical trials. This study
used a list of published AEs as the gold standard. As a
result, newly detected signals can be observed due to
the differences in the terminologies used. Second, the
interpretation of the correlation between detected
signals and published AEs listed in the literature may
be subjective or arbitrary. There is no standard
criteria for classifying AEs into mutually exclusive
categories, which can lead to significant overlap e.g.,
proteinuria and kidney failure. However, the spectrum of proteinuria includes asymptomatic low-grade
proteinuria to severe proteinuria (e.g., nephrotic
syndrome), of which a certain proportion may
progress to kidney failure. Proteinuria can also be
absent or minimal in several types of renal failure
until progression to severe renal dysfunction. If
we could not conclude the published items as totally
overlapping, we considered them as distinct terms,
and used the items as exclusive to rosuvastatin. To
ensure unbiased categorization of lists (rosuvastatinspecific vs. class effects), we asked two independent,
blinded physicians to evaluate the consistency
between the lists.

severe or serious cases can be selected in the analysis of
this study. For instance, injury, poisoning, and certain
other consequences of external causes were detected as
signals, but were not listed in the reference literature
(Table 3). Neuralgia, which is in the list of published
AEs, could theoretically be related to various types of
injury since neuralgia can induce motor disturbance,
which can increase the risk of falling. In addition,
subsequent medications for neuralgic pain may also
increase the risk of falling or injury.
This study has several strengths. First, we used the
large national health insurance claims database to
detect signals. This database includes comprehensive
information of more than one million elderly patients
in Seoul, South Korea, and provides an actual
denominator for drug prescription in contrast to
the use of spontaneous ADR reporting databases
where the lack of a denominator is a fundamental
issue. The design of this study considered the
potential for duplication of a given drug-SAE pair
in the database, which is a common occurrence when
using spontaneous reporting data.10 Second, the
study was performed on a homogeneous population
of elderly patients who are not usually involved in
premarketing clinical trials. These elderly patients
have co-morbid conditions as well as multiple
medications, and AEs can appear more frequently
in them than in younger age groups. Nevertheless,
drug safety data on these susceptible subpopulation is
usually limited. Third, we selected other statins apart
from rosuvastatin as reference drugs to minimize
indication bias and ensure the comparability of SAEs
between targeted drug users and controls. Fourth, the
HIRA database does not rely on reported AEs. This
provides the opportunity to detect previously unrecognized or underappreciated AEs, which is not
possible with spontaneous ADR reporting databases.
Moreover, to focus on observable serious events, we
defined potential SAEs of drugs as events requiring
hospitalization. Accordingly, the degree of AE
severity can be considered and clinically important
AEs warranting hospitalization could have priority in
drug safety surveillance.
However, these results must be interpreted in light
of a number of limitations. First, although we used a
national database, we analyzed data for a restricted
time period of 12 months from a restricted location,
Seoul. The number of rosuvastatin users was close to
7000, which may not be enough to detect some rare
AEs. Further study may identify signals of rare
occurrence using a larger population for a longer
observation period. Second, we considered SAEs as
the administrative diagnoses at admission, which

might differ from the actual diagnoses of patients.
However, in a validation study, diagnoses derived
from the HIRA database were compared to the actual
diagnoses in patient medical records.21 The overall
PPV of the diagnoses was 81.8% in the case of
inpatients. Third, because drug exposure is based on
prescription claims record, a difference may exist
between prescription and actual use of medication.
We did not consider exposure duration or dose.
Fourth, this database included information necessary
for reimbursement, but did not contain other factors
such as patients’ overall health status, or lifestyle
information. Fifth, as there is no gold standard for
signal detection as an evaluation of the performance
of signal-detection methods,22 we used the published
AEs of statins as a surrogate for the gold standard.
Recently, the Bayesian Confidence Propagation
Neural Network, a data-mining signaling method,
was also tested in terms of its performance in signal
detection against standard literature sources on a
retrospective basis.23 We also intended to detect the
SAEs related to rosuvastatin, but used all published
AEs as reference, rather than SAEs. Therefore, there
could be a discrepancy between the detected signals
and the concordant reference lists, which can be from
mild to serious. We classified the published AEs as
rosuvastatin-specific AEs and the AEs of all other
statins, but the two groups might not be mutually
exclusive. Moreover, these signals as SAEs should
be evaluated to be causally-related to statin use.
Further studies that consider these perspectives are
needed.
CONCLUSION
The novel data-mining index based on RR can
identify certain published AEs of rosuvastatin at
the market approval stage from a large health

insurance claims database, which indicates a potential
usefulness for detecting ADRs of other drugs as well.
This could mean the contribution to the development
of timely preventive strategies. However, despite the
encouraging results of our study, the presented
approaches will require further investigation to develop
a more sophisticated index.
