Background. The ﬁrst trivalent live-attenuated inﬂuenza vaccine (LAIV3) was licensed in 2003 for use in
healthy persons 5–49 years of age. In 2007, the US Food and Drug Administration expanded its indication
to healthy children 2–4 years of age.
Methods. We searched the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) for US reports after LAIV3 from
July 1, 2005 to June 30, 2012 in children aged 2–18 years. Medical records were requested for nonmanufacturer
reports coded as serious (ie, death, hospitalization, prolonged hospitalization, life-threatening illness, disability).
We characterized electronic data and clinically reviewed all serious reports and reports of special interest.
Empirical Bayesian data mining was used to identify new or unexpected adverse events (AEs).
Results. During the study period, VAERS received 2619 US LAIV3 reports for children aged 2–18 years; 197
(7.5%) reports were serious, including 5 deaths. The 2 most frequent nonfatal serious reports involved
neurological and respiratory systems, with 56 (29.2%) and 43 (22.4%) reports, respectively. The most frequent
neurological diagnoses were seizures and Guillain-Barré Syndrome, and the most frequent respiratory conditions
were pneumonia and asthma or reactive airway disease. Data mining showed increased proportions for reports
of medication errors, most commonly vaccine administration errors not associated with an AE.
Conclusions. In this VAERS analysis of reports following LAIV3, we found no new or unexpected AEs
patterns. Reports of LAIV3 administration to persons, for whom it is not recommended, including children with
a history of asthma or reactive airway disease or wheezing, indicate that ongoing monitoring and education in
vaccine indications are needed.

In 2003, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) licensed trivalent live-attenuated inﬂuenza vaccine (LAIV3)
(FluMist) for healthy nonpregnant persons aged 5–49
years to prevent inﬂuenza caused by 2 inﬂuenza A and 1
inﬂuenza B virus strains [1–3]. In 2007, the FDA expanded
the age indication to include healthy children aged 2–4
years [4–6]; the Advisory Committee on Immunization
Practices (ACIP) subsequently also included this new
age group in its recommendations [7]. In 2008, ACIP recommended universal inﬂuenza vaccination for all children
aged 6 months [8] and reiterated that healthy children
aged 2 years and adolescents who are not pregnant

could be vaccinated with either LAIV3 or trivalentinactivated inﬂuenza vaccine (IIV3) [5, 6, 8]. In 2012, the
FDA licensed Quadrivalent LAIV4 (FluMist Quadrivalent), which includes the same strains in the trivalent
formulation plus 1 additional type B virus strain [9, 10];
the ACIP incorporated LAIV4 into its recommendations
for the 2013–2014 inﬂuenza season [11, 12].
Prelicensure studies [13] and postlicensure assessment of
reports after LAIV3 to the Vaccine Adverse Event
Reporting System (VAERS) in the ﬁrst 2 years after licensure in 2003 [14] did not identify unexpected serious adverse events (AEs) in persons aged 5–49 years. However,

rare AEs may not be detected until a vaccine is widely used
in the population [15]. We analyzed reports to VAERS following LAIV3 in children aged 2–18 years from July 1,
2005 through June 30, 2012 to further assess the pediatric
safety proﬁle of LAIV3.
In conjunction with the ﬁndings of Izurieta et al. [14],
our results provided baseline information while we monitored the safety of LAIV4 [9, 12].

METHODS
The Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, coadministered by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
and FDA, is a national spontaneous reporting system for
monitoring AEs after vaccines [16, 17]. The Vaccine
Adverse Event Reporting System accepts reports from vaccine manufacturers, healthcare providers, vaccine recipients, and others. The VAERS form collects information
that includes demographics of the vaccinee, type of vaccine(s) received, and AEs experienced. Signs and symptoms
of AEs are coded by trained personnel using the Medical
Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) [18] and
entered into a database; the codes are not medically conﬁrmed diagnoses. A report may be assigned 1 or more
MedDRA-preferred terms (PTs); however, not all reports
will include a term describing an AE (eg, report of inappropriate age of administration). A report is classiﬁed as serious if 1 of the following is reported: death, life-threatening
illness, hospitalization, prolongation of hospitalization, or
permanent disability [19]. Except for reports submitted by
manufacturers, which usually include a detailed clinical description, medical records are routinely requested and reviewed for reports categorized as serious. For serious
reports, we ascertained the primary event (the event that
appeared to trigger the reporter to report to VAERS) and
categorized the case into 1 of the diagnostic categories
such as neurologic and respiratory events used in a previous analysis [20]. Cause of death was based on information
in the autopsy report, death certiﬁcate, or medical record.
We analyzed VAERS reports received by September 30,
2012 for children aged 2–18 years vaccinated with LAIV3
from July 1, 2005 through June 30, 2012. Reports of vaccinations received outside the United States, duplicate
reports, and reports with an unknown age were excluded.
We evaluated the characteristics of reports in 2 age groups:
2–4 years and 5–18 years separately.
Clinical Review of Reports

Our clinical review included all serious reports and reports classiﬁed as nonserious reports such as the following: (1) anaphylaxis and Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS)

Disproportionality Analysis

We used Empirical Bayesian (EB) data mining to identify
PTs that were reported more frequently than expected following LAIV3 compared with other vaccines. For consistency with the rest of the analysis, we limited the data to
US reports for children 2–18 years of age who had received
immunizations 2005–2012 [24]. We used published criteria by Szarfman et al. [25] to identify LAIV3 AE pairs
with reporting proportions greater than twice that of all
other vaccines combined. We ranked event-vaccine pairs
based on the lower bound of 90% conﬁdence interval.
Clinical reviews were conducted if the EB05 was >2.
The Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System is a routine surveillance program conducted as a public health
function and does not meet the deﬁnition of research;
thus, it is not subject to Institutional Review Board review
and informed consent requirements.
RESULTS
Descriptive Analysis

From July 1, 2005 to June 30, 2012, VAERS received 2619
US LAIV3 reports in children aged 2–18 years (Table1);
197 (7.5%) were serious reports. The number of reports
in both age groups (2–4 years and 5–18 years) increased
steadily from 2005 to 2011, with a peak during both the
2009–2010 and 2010–2011 inﬂuenza seasons, mostly
due to increase of nonserious reports (Figure 1).
The proportion of serious reports in children 2–4 years
peaked at 25% (15 of 60) during the 2007–2008 inﬂuenza
season when LAIV3 was approved for use in this age
group, and it subsequently declined to 4.8% (7 of 145)
during the 2011–2012 season (Figure 1). The top 10
MedDRA coding terms (Table 1) were similar for both
age groups.
Clinical Review

Medical records were available for 136 (69%) of 197
serious reports.

Data Source

since the results of previous studies [21] have suggested
that a causal association with LAIV3 is biologically plausible; (2) selected PTs of clinical importance detected
through data mining; and (3) reports suggesting that
LAIV3 was administered to certain individuals for
whom the vaccine is not recommended (ie, pregnant
women, individuals with a history of asthma, and persons
with egg allergy). To search for prespeciﬁed events and reports pertaining to special populations, we used speciﬁc
MedDRA codes, which are shown in the Appendix.
Reports of GBS and anaphylaxis were veriﬁed by using
the Brighton Collaboration case deﬁnitions or a physician’s diagnosis [22, 23].

Fatal Reports

We identiﬁed 5 death reports in VAERS after LAIV3 vaccinations, all in children aged 5–18 years (Table 2). Four of
the children had a history of an underlying chronic condition. Except for the case of status asthmaticus, all deaths
occurred >30 days after receiving LAIV3.
Nonfatal Serious Reports

The 2 most frequently reported nonfatal serious AEs were
neurological and respiratory with 56 (29.2%) and 43
(22.4%) reports, respectively (Table 3). Among neurological

conditions, the most frequent diagnoses were seizures
and GBS. Among respiratory conditions, the most frequent
diagnoses were pneumonia and asthma or reactive
airway disease with 14 (7.3%) and 12 (6.2%) reports,
respectively.
Among the 15 serious seizure reports, 8 were male and
the median age was 4 years (range, 2–13 years). Two reports were febrile seizures (ages 2 and 10 years old). The
median onset interval was 1 day (range, 0–24 days). Of
the other 13 reports, 4 had a previous history of seizures

The report of Leigh’s disease involved a 6-year-old female with a history of prematurity (29 weeks), pneumonia, and gastroesophageal reflux disease. She presented with
weakness prior to vaccination, but weakness became more pronounced after vaccination (unspecified onset interval of weakness), and she had ataxia, difficulty breathing
and swallowing, and was subsequently diagnosed with Leigh encephalopathy syndrome while hospitalized. Her condition deteriorated, and she died 21 days after
admission.

and 2 had a family history of seizures. Eight (53%) recovered by the time the VAERS form was submitted.
Prespeciﬁed Adverse Events
Guillain-Barré Syndrome. A total of 14 (7.3%) of 192

nonfatal serious reports were reported as GBS. Ages
ranged from 3 through 18 years, and 11 were (79%)
males. We veriﬁed all 14 GBS reports; 8 reports met the
Brighton case deﬁnition criteria level 1, 5 were level 2,
and 1 was level 3 [22]. Five (35.7%) reports of GBS were
received during the 2009–2010 season; no one received
concomitant inactivated H1N1 vaccine with the LAIV3.
The other 9 were evenly distributed during the other
inﬂuenza seasons. Thirteen had an onset interval within
42 days of vaccination, and 1 had an onset interval of 46
days (Figure 2). In 5 of 14 reports, patients presented
with upper respiratory infection or fever or diarrheal
disease within 6 days before vaccination. Four cases
occurred in males who were vaccinated in military
hospitals or clinics; all 4 received other vaccines
simultaneously with LAIV3.
Anaphylaxis. Five reports described anaphylaxis in children
2–18 years after LAIV3. One report met Brighton level
1 and 2 Brighton level 2 [23]. Two reports did not have
medical records to verify the diagnosis. All were male;
3 were classiﬁed as serious. Onset interval ranged from
5 minutes to 5 hours after LAIV3. Two reports included
4 or more additional vaccines administered at the same

visit. One anaphylaxis report (Brighton level 2) involved
an 8-year-old male with a history of atopic dermatitis
and food allergy (including egg allergy) since 5 months of
age. The patient ingested eggs before receiving LAIV3 and
within 5 hours presented with diffuse urticarial rash,
wheezing, and dyspnea; he was treated with epinephrine
and diphenhydramine and recovered.
Adverse Events in Special Populations
History of Asthma, Reactive Airway Disease, or Wheezing.

One hundred nineteen reports after LAIV involved
patients with a history of asthma, reactive airway disease,
or wheezing. Twenty-ﬁve (21.0%) were serious reports,
which included a death report with status asthmaticus as
the cause of death. Among the 119 reports, 10 had a
diagnosis of asthma exacerbation, 3 of which were coded
as serious. Ninety-ﬁve (79.8%) reports described at least 1
AE, with respiratory as the most common diagnostic
category (47; 39.5%). Twenty-four (20.2%) reports were
vaccination errors; most were due to exposure to LAIV3
in a person in whom it is contraindicated. Among the 12
serious reports in which the main diagnosis was asthma,
7 had a prior history of asthma.
Pregnancy. Eighteen pregnant adolescents received LAIV3
(median age, 15 years; range, 14–18 years). Of the
12 reports with information on duration of pregnancy,
8 received LAIV3 in the ﬁrst trimester, 3 in the second
trimester, and 1 in the third trimester. Two experienced

Egg Allergy. VAERS received 10 reports of children with a
history of egg allergy; 3 were serious AEs: (1) ataxia, (2)
pneumonia and reactive airway disease, and (3) headache
with bilateral foot pain. As noted previously, 1 was a report
of anaphylaxis in a child with a history of egg allergy.
Disproportionality Analysis

Data mining analysis identiﬁed 14 PTs with an EB05 >2.0.
Four PTs referred to signs and symptoms that were
observed during prelicensure trials and were included in
the manufacturer’s package insert (rhinorrhea, nasal

Pneumonia

There were 13 reports, of which 9 met the regulatory definition of serious [19]. The median interval from vaccination to symptom onset was 1 day (range, 0–39 days). Seven
reports described preexisting medical conditions, which included 2 reports with a history of asthma, reactive airway
disease, or wheezing; 1 report was of a patient whose
brother was diagnosed with streptococcal A pharyngitis
3 days before the patient’s vaccination, and 1 report of a
patient who was exposed to a contact with an upper respiratory infection. Four reports had additional diagnoses
other than pneumonia, including: reactive airway disease;
pleural effusion and dehydration; respiratory failure due to
H1N1 inﬂuenza and status asthmaticus; Kawasaki disease;
and aseptic meningitis. Of the 9 serious reports, 8 required
hospitalization and 6 recovered by the time the VAERS
form was submitted.
Inﬂuenza

Among the 86 reports with a PT of inﬂuenza, 13 (15.1%)
were marked as serious [19]. Forty-three cases (50%) were
male, and the median age was 6.5 years (range, 2–18
years). The median onset was 3 days after vaccination.
Thirty-four (39.5%) were vaccinated during the 2009–
2010 H1N1 pandemic.
Vaccine Administration Errors

Ninety-nine percent of the 479 reports with PTs pertaining
to vaccine administration errors (expired drug administered [n = 425], medication error [n = 24], accidental exposure [n = 18], and contraindication to vaccine [n = 12]) did
not describe any AE. Nonserious AEs were reported, such
as epistaxis, eye photosensitivity, ocular hyperemia,
inﬂuenza-like illness, and nausea and vomiting. However,
there were 2 serious reports: (1) a fatal report due to Leigh
syndrome (Table 2) that included a PT of “expired drug administered,” and (2) a serious report of a 2-year-old male

congestion, oropharyngeal pain, and cough). (Some reports were identiﬁed through chart review of other serious
outcomes.) Two PTs referred to laboratory results (inﬂuenza B test positive, inﬂuenza B virus test) and were not further reviewed. The remaining 8 PTs included epistaxis,
inﬂuenza, pneumonia, sleep apnea, expired drug administered, medication error, accidental exposure, and contraindication to vaccine.
After clinical review, we found that reports with the PT
“epistaxis” were mild and did not require hospitalization,
except for 1 serious report in a patient hospitalized for
H1N1 inﬂuenza. Among reports with the PT “sleep
apnea,” 3 of 4 serious reports required hospitalization
for medical conditions unrelated to sleep apnea. In 1 nonserious report, sleep apnea was a preexisting condition.

with a history of asthma, who experienced an asthma exacerbation after receiving LAIV3.

DISCUSSION
Since 2005, approximately 50 million doses of LAIV3 have
been distributed for use in adults and children ( personal
communication; MedImmune, July 2013). Our review of
the 2619 reports submitted to VAERS after LAIV3 vaccination in children aged 2–18 years did not identify any new or
unexpected safety concerns. Our results are consistent with
the ﬁrst VAERS LAIV3 review by Izurieta et al. [14]. Other
post-marketing studies in the United States comparing the
safety of LAIV3 to control groups (IIV3 and unvaccinated)
did not report unexpected AEs [26–28]. Baxter et al. [27]
evaluated LAIV safety in children 5–17 years and found a
similar pattern of medically attended AEs for both LAIV3
and control groups. Our results are consistent with previously reported pre- and postlicensure studies that suggest
that LAIV3 has a favorable safety proﬁle when used according to indications [28].
Our clinical review of 5 fatal serious reports after LAIV3
revealed varying causes of death. In 1 of the fatal reports, a
patient with a history of asthma died of status asthmaticus.
We also found that more than half of the patients with a
reported reaction of asthma or reactive airway disease
had a preexisting history of asthma. The manufacturer’s
package insert [1] contains a statement in the Warning
and Precautions section, regarding the risk of wheezing
in individuals with a prior history of asthma and wheezing.
We also noted inadvertent administration of LAIV3 in
pregnant teenagers [29]. These cases indicate the need for
greater efforts to educate vaccine providers on the proper

indications for LAIV3 to prevent the administration of
the vaccine to those in whom the product’s safety and effectiveness have not been established.
Among serious reports, the most common medical conditions reported after LAIV3 were neurological and respiratory AEs, which comprised more than half of all serious
reports. Afebrile seizures and GBS were the most common
neurological diagnosis. Guillain-Barré Syndrome is an
acute, immune-mediated paralytic disorder of the peripheral nervous system. Guillain-Barré Syndrome has been
linked to IIV3, but several studies have not shown any increased risk [30, 31]. Guillain-Barré Syndrome is rare in
children with an incidence of 0.62 and 0.75 cases per
100 000 person-years in those 0–9 years and 10–19
years, respectively [32]. In 10 (90.9%) of 14 VAERS reports of GBS following LAIV3 in children, the interval between date of vaccination and symptom onset was within
the commonly accepted window of biologic plausibility of
5–42 days [20, 21, 32]. We did not calculate GBS reporting
rates because doses distributed were unavailable by age
group. We also did not ﬁnd disproportionate reporting
for GBS. Six (42.9%) of the 14 veriﬁed GBS cases were vaccinated during the 2009–2010 season, which may reﬂect
stimulated reporting during the 2009 H1N1 inﬂuenza pandemic season [20]. We also found that 4 of 14 GBS reports
after LAIV3 were reported by vaccine providers from military clinics, which may tend to report certain AEs more
frequently than civilian facilities [33].
Anaphylaxis is causally associated with inﬂuenza vaccination [8, 21]. Although our review identiﬁed 5 cases of
anaphylaxis, concomitant administration with other vaccines made it difﬁcult to assess whether LAIV3 contributed
to the reaction. We also found reports in children with egg

Safety of Live-Attenuated Inﬂuenza Vaccine

CONCLUSIONS
Our review of reports to VAERS after LAIV3 vaccination in
children aged 2–18 years during 7 inﬂuenza seasons did
not identify any new or unexpected safety concerns. We
did identify reports in persons for whom LAIV is contraindicated (ie, children with egg allergy or asthma, administration to pregnant teenagers), demonstrating the need for
greater efforts to educate vaccine providers and administrators on the proper indications for LAIV. Continued assessment of the safety of LAIV and other inﬂuenza vaccines is

needed as more children are vaccinated annually, including
with the recently approved LAIV4 vaccine [9, 10].

allergy for whom LAIV3 is contraindicated [34, 35], further highlighting the importance of educating providers regarding proper indications and contraindications for use of
LAIV3.
We found 12 serious reports of asthma or wheezing.
Similar to our ﬁndings, the earlier VAERS LAIV3 postmarketing study also found asthma episodes among children aged 6–15 years [14]. However, the present analysis
did not demonstrate disproportionately higher reporting
for asthma and wheezing. Some prior studies have suggested an increase in wheezing events in young children after
LAIV3 [5, 6]. A study that included children aged 2–4
years, however, did not ﬁnd an increase in rates of medically attended wheezing after LAIV3 vs IIV [36]. In addition,
more recent post-marketing studies did not observe an
increased rate of asthma and wheezing among children
who received LAIV3 compared to those who received
IIV3 [26–28].
Medication errors can have potentially serious consequences [37]. Administration errors comprised a disproportionately large share of reports submitted to VAERS
following LAIV3. Administration of expired drug was the
most common medication error; this result may be due to
the shorter shelf-life for LAIV3 (18 weeks) compared with
inactivated inﬂuenza vaccines (12 months) [1]. Administration of an expired dose of LAIV3, however, is not
known to increase the risk of reactogenicity or other adverse
outcomes, other than potential lack of inﬂuenza protection
(personal communication; MedImmune, September 2013).
Passive surveillance systems such as VAERS are subject
to limitations, including underreporting and incomplete
information [16, 17]. Because of these limitations, it is
usually not possible to verify causal associations between
vaccines and AEs from spontaneous reports to VAERS.
However, as a national surveillance system, VAERS has
the advantage that it may be used to detect signals of
potential vaccine safety concerns, which can be further
explored in carefully designed epidemiological studies
[15, 20].
