Abstract
Purpose: Current guidelines recommend α1-adrenoreceptor blockers (A1Bs) for treating lower
urinary tract symptoms suggestive of benign prostatic hyperplasia, but their adverse effects can be
problematic. In this study, reports submitted to the US Food and Drug Administration Adverse
Event Reporting System (FAERS) between 1997 and 2011 were reviewed to assess the safety
profiles of A1Bs.
Methods: After deleting duplicated submissions and revising arbitrary drug names, reports involving A1Bs for male patients were analyzed. Data mining algorisms were used for the quantitative detection of signals, where a signal represents an association between a drug and an adverse
event or a drug-associated adverse event, including the proportional reporting ratio, reporting
odds ratio, information component given by a Bayesian confidence propagation neural network,
and empirical Bayes geometric mean.
Results: The total number of reports used was 1,260,182. Signal scores suggested the associations of alfuzosin, doxazosin, tamsulosin, and terazosin with dizziness/vertigo, orthostatic hypotension, erectile dysfunction, ejaculation dysfunction (EjD), thirst/dry mouth, and constipation;
however, reports on naftopidil, silodosin, and urapidil were not enough to compare with the other
4 A1Bs. Signal scores for EjD were higher for tamsulosin, and those for dizziness/vertigo were
lower for doxazosin than for the other 3 drugs.
Conclusions: Tamsulosin-associated EjD, which was found in clinical studies, was reproduced in
this analysis with markedly higher signal scores, and these results strongly suggest the necessity of
well-organized clinical studies on A1B-associated adverse events.
Key words: adverse events, FAERS, α1 blockers, pharmacoepidemiology.

Introduction
α1-Adrenoreceptor blockers (A1Bs) are used
worldwide to relieve obstructive urinary symptoms,
especially by men with benign prostatic hyperplasia

(BPH), as many guidelines recommend the usage of
A1Bs as a first line therapy for moderate to severe
lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) suggestive of
http://www.medsci.org

Int. J. Med. Sci. 2013, Vol. 10
BPH [1-3]. The latest version of the guidelines on the
management of BPH from the American Urological
Association [1] and the guidelines on the management
of male LUTS from the European Urological Association [2] refer to four A1Bs, alfuzosin, doxazosin,
tamsulosin, and terazosin, while the Japanese guidelines for BPH also recommend naftopidil and silodosin [3]. These recommendations are based on clinical evidence; however, relatively few reports are
available for their safety profiles.
Early developed A1Bs, i.e., alfuzosin, doxazosin,
and terazosin, were shown to lack α1-adrenoreceptor
subtype selectivity [4], and are supposed to induce
vascular adverse events, such as orthostatic hypotension. In contrast, recently developed A1Bs show
α1-adrenoreceptor subtype selectivity, i.e., tamsulosin
(α1a and α1d-selective), naftopidil (α1d-selective),
and silodosin (α1a-selective) [4], and these are
thought to result in a relatively low incidence of vascular adverse events than that of the early developed
A1Bs. A recently published meta-analysis concluded
that asthenia/fatigue, dizziness, and hypotension
were more pronounced for doxazosin and terazosin
than for tamsulosin [5]; however, the same analysis
indicated that alfuzosin developed these adverse
events on the same level as that of tamsulosin, suggesting that the safety profiles of A1Bs cannot be explained only by in vitro α1-adrenoreceptor subtype
selectivity.
BPH is a commonly reported disease in older
men that can lead to LUTS, and male sexual dysfunction, e.g., decreased libido, erectile dysfunction (ED)
and ejaculation dysfunction (EjD), is also age-related
[6]. Epidemiological studies have confirmed a link
between BPH/LUTS and sexual dysfunction in older
men, which is independent of age and cardiovascular
co-morbidities [6]. Various treatments with drugs for
BPH/LUTS may affect sexuality, with differences
being observed between drug classes and between
drugs within the same class [6, 7]. The treatments
with A1Bs are generally thought to have a beneficial
effect on decreased libido and ED, whereas their impact on EjD varies among A1Bs [7]. The safety profiles of A1Bs vary across previous reports, and their
comparisons in the same study are quite limited.
In this study, adverse event reports submitted to
the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) [8] were
reviewed to assess the adverse event profiles of 7
A1Bs; alfuzosin, doxazosin, tamsulosin, terazosin,
naftopidil, silodosin, and urapidil. Data mining algorithms were used for the quantitative detection of
signals [9-18], in which a signal represents an association between a drug and an adverse event or a
drug-associated adverse event. The adverse events

865
analyzed included dizziness/vertigo, orthostatic hypotension, ED, EjD, thirst/dry mouth, constipation,
and diarrhea.

Methods
Data sources
Input data were taken from the public release of
the FDA’s Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS,
formerly AERS) database [8], which covers the period
from the fourth quarter of 1997 through to the third
quarter of 2011. The total number of reports used was
4,671,217. Besides those from manufacturers, reports
can be submitted from health care professionals and
the public. Its structure adheres to the international
safety reporting guidance issued by the International
Conference on Harmonisation, ICH E2B [19]. A data
set consists of 7 data tables; patient demographic and
administrative information (DEMO), drug/biologic
information (DRUG), adverse events (REAC), patient
outcomes (OUTC), report sources (RPSR), drug therapy start and end dates (THER), and indications for
use/diagnosis (INDI). Adverse events and medication errors are coded using the preferred terms (PTs)
in the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities
(MedDRA) terminology [20], with version 15.1 being
used in this study.
Prior to data mining, duplicated reports were
deleted according to the FDA's recommendation of
adopting the most recent CASE number, resulting in a
reduction in the number of reports from 4,671,217 to
3,472,494. All drug names were unified into generic
names by a text-mining approach, because the FAERS
permits the registering of arbitrary drug names, including trade names and abbreviations. Spelling errors were detected by the spell checker software,
GNU Aspell, and were carefully confirmed by working pharmacists. Foods, beverages, treatments (e.g.
X-ray radiation), and unspecified names (e.g. beta-blockers) were omitted for this study. In this study,
reports of females and those without gender data
were deleted; therefore, the total number of reports
used was 1,260,182.
Consequently, a total of
19,184,590 co-occurrences were found in 1,260,182
reports, where a co-occurrence was a pair of a drug
and an adverse event, and they were the basis for
signal detection.

Definition of adverse events
According to the MedDRA ver. 15.1, constipation, diarrhea, and orthostatic hypotension were
coded as PT10010774, PT10012735, and PT10031127,
respectively. Adverse events coded by PT10043458
(thirst) and PT10013781 (dry mouth) were defined as

http://www.medsci.org

Int. J. Med. Sci. 2013, Vol. 10
thirst/dry mouth; those coded by PT10013573 (dizziness), PT10013576 (dizziness exertional), PT10013578
(dizziness
postural),
PT10047340
(vertigo),
PT10047343 (vertigo central nervous system origin),
PT10047344 (vertigo labyrinthine), PT10047348 (vertigo positional), and PT10066964 (procedural dizziness), as dizziness/vertigo; those coded by
PT10052004
(organic
erectile
dysfunction),
PT10052005 (psychogenic erectile dysfunction), and
PT10061461 (erectile dysfunction), as ED; and those
coded by PT10014325 (ejaculation delayed),
PT10014326 (ejaculation disorder), PT10014328 (ejaculation failure), PT10059013 (nocturnal emission), and
PT10038967 (retrograde ejaculation), as EjD.

Data Mining
Data mining algorithms have been developed to
identify drug-associated adverse events (signals) that
are reported more frequently than expected by estimating expected reporting frequencies on the basis of
information on all drugs and all events in the database
[13-18]. For example, the proportional reporting ratio
(PRR) [9], the reporting odds ratio (ROR) [10], the
information component (IC) [11], and the empirical
Bayes geometric mean (EBGM) [12] are widely used,
and indeed, currently employed by the Medicines and
Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA),
UK, the Netherlands Pharmacovigilance Centre, the
World Health Organization (WHO), and the FDA,
respectively. All of these algorithms calculate signal
scores, i.e., values for PRR, ROR, IC, and EBGM, to
assess whether a drug is significantly associated with
an adverse event or not from a two-by-two frequency
table of counts. However, these calculations or algorithms, so-called disproportionality analyses or
measures, differ from one another in that the PRR and
ROR are frequentist (non-Bayesian), whereas the IC
and EBGM are Bayesian.
In this section, only the scoring thresholds are
given. The reader is referred to previous articles for
more extensive details on each statistical test [9-12].
Using the PRR, a signal is detected if the number of
co-occurrences is 3 or more and the PRR is 2 or more
with an associated χ2 value of 4 or more [9]. For the
ROR, a signal is detected, if the lower limit of the 95%
two-sided confidence interval exceeds 1 [10]. Signal
detection using the IC is done using the IC025 metric,
a lower limit of the 95% two-sided confidence interval
of the IC, and a signal is detected if the IC025 value
exceeds 0 [11]. Finally, for the EBGM, the EB05 metric, a lower one-sided 95% confidence limit of the
EBGM, is used and a signal is detected when the EB05
is greater than or equal to the threshold value 2.0 [12].

Results
The total number of co-occurrences with alfuzosin was 12,992, and 48,001 for doxazosin, 2,084 for
naftopidil, 1,934 for silodosin, 82,799 for tamsulosin,
34,011 for terazosin, and 3,845 for urapidil. The values for naftopidil, silodosin, and urapidil were not
large enough to compare with the other 4 A1Bs. Table
1 lists the signal scores for alfuzosin-, doxazosin-,
tamsulosin-,
and
terazosin-associated
dizziness/vertigo and orthostatic hypotension, with those
for ED and EjD being listed in Table 2 and those for
thirst/dry mouth and constipation being listed in
Table 3. The scores indicated significant associations
of 4 A1Bs with these adverse events. The scores for
dizziness/vertigo were the lowest for doxazosin,
whereas they were similar among the 4 A1Bs for orthostatic hypotension (Table 1). No significant differences in scores were observed among the 4 A1Bs
for ED, while those for EjD were markedly higher for
tamsulosin than for the other A1Bs (Table 2). The
scores indicated that associations with thirst/dry
mouth and constipation were marginal (Table 3), and
associations with diarrhea were not significant (data
not shown).

Discussion
Dizziness/vertigo and orthostatic hypotension
are important vascular adverse events for A1B users.
A meta-analysis suggested that vascular adverse
events were more pronounced for doxazosin (conventional standard formulation) and terazosin than
for alfuzosin and tamsulosin [5]. This analysis also
suggested that the gastrointestinal therapeutic system
(GITS), i.e., controlled-release formulation, may affect
the safety profiles of doxazosin [5]. In this study,
these 4 A1Bs were shown to be associated with dizziness/vertigo and orthostatic hypotension (Table 1).
Additionally, the signal scores suggested differences
among the A1Bs in terms of susceptibility to these
events; however, the position of doxazoin in the
rank-order of scores was lower than that of the meta-analysis. Doxazosin is often prescribed for patients
with hypertension. Sub-analysis after stratification
according to indication or formulation may resolve
this discrepancy.
A1Bs for BPH are generally recognized to have a
beneficial effect on sexual dysfunction, especially ED
[7]. An improvement in ED by A1Bs has been reported by several clinical studies [21-24], although
this effect was not always observed [25-27]. As shown
in Table 2, the signal scores suggested significant associations of A1Bs with ED, but associations were
barely detectable. This suggests that A1Bs have only

867

slight effects on ED, if any. The signal scores were
larger for EjD than for ED, with a markedly higher
value being observed for tamsulosin (Table 2).
Tamsulosin, and a higher level of silodosin, can increase the risk of EjD [6, 7, 28-31], and these findings
in clinical studies were reproduced in this analysis.

Tamsulosin and silodosin selectively antagonize the
α1a adrenereceptor subtype [4], which is widely distributed in organs including in the emission phase of
ejaculation, and this is a potential explanation for the
high risk of EjD [6].

Gastrointestinal adverse events do not attract
much attention for A1Bs. The signal scores suggested
that A1Bs had potential associations with thirst/dry
mouth and constipation, but these associations were
marginal and depended on the data mining methods
(Table 3). However, many patients treated with A1Bs
were noted to have persistent storage symptoms [32].
Although the current guidelines recommended A1Bs
and 5-α reductase inhibitors, either alone or in combination, for BPH/LUTS, the additional use of antimuscarinic drugs may be an option in the near future
[32]. Gastrointestinal adverse events caused by antimuscarinic drugs can be problematic; however, data
on efficacy and safety after long-term use are not
available [32]. Assessing the safety profiles of antimuscarinic drugs using the FAERS database may
provide useful information for the management of
patients with BPH/LUTS.
Data mining of the FAERS database has several
limitations. First, adverse events are underreported
[18]. Even though the reporting rate has markedly
improved, the FAERS database is still not appropriate
for estimating incidence rates, due to the absence of a
denominator.
Second, data occasionally contain
misspelling and miswords, and there are also a number of duplicate entries [13]. These problems were
resolved in the present study, prior to the analysis.
Third, the system was started more than 10 years ago,
and reporting patterns, especially the PTs of
MedDRA, have changed over time [13]. Fourth, sig-

nal scores are influenced by various factors, especially
when it comes to recently launched drugs [18]. Fifth,
it should be noted that there is no credible counterfactual means, e.g., a randomized control group, to list
drug-associated adverse events (signals); therefore,
disease-oriented adverse events can be listed as signals [18].
In conclusion, reports in the FAERS database
were reviewed to assess the safety profiles of A1Bs.
From 1,260,182 reports for male patients between 1997
and 2011, alfuzosin, doxazosin, tamsulosin, and
terazosin were associated with dizziness/vertigo,
orthostatic hypotension, ED, EjD, thirst/dry mouth,
and constipation. Tamsulosin-associated EjD, which
was found in clinical studies, was reproduced in this
analysis with markedly higher signal scores, and these results strongly suggest the necessity of
well-organized clinical studies on A1B-associated
adverse events.
