SUMMARY
Purpose Abacavir is associated with an infrequent but potentially serious hypersensitivity reaction (HSR) that can include
a wide range of signs and symptoms. Identification of this reaction through medical insurance claims could provide a simple
and efficient means of monitoring the incidence of abacavir hypersensitivity in large populations of patients.
Methods Using data from a safety study of 948 abacavir users with 22 hypersensitivity events identified from claims and
validated through medical record review, we used a recursive partitioning analysis to construct an algorithm to differentiate
between patients with and without validated adverse events. Bootstrap resampling techniques provided validation for the
analysis.
Results The analysis produced a classification tree with three decision nodes that comprised the best indicators of HSRs.
The predictors included any one of several specific symptoms commonly found with this reaction, a claims diagnosis of
adverse effect of drug, anaphylactic shock or unspecified allergy, and a discontinuation in abacavir prior to completing a
90-day course of therapy. The algorithm demonstrated 95% sensitivity and 90% specificity when tested using a bootstrap
resampling approach with the current data.
Conclusions A sensitive and specific algorithm for identifying abacavir hypersensitivity from claims was created.
This algorithm would permit efficient identification of charts for medical review. Further testing of the algorithm with
additional medical claims data for abacavir users will be required to ascertain its validity across databases. Copyright # 2007

INTRODUCTION
Abacavir is a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor used for treatment of HIV. Abacavir causes a
hypersensitivity reaction (HSR) in about 4% of
recipients,1 with a range in clinical studies from 0%
to 14%.2 HSR symptoms indicate multi-organ-system

involvement and usually appear in the first 6 weeks of
treatment with abacavir, with a median time to onset of
8 days.3 Signs and symptoms of abacavir-related HSR
may include fever, rash, gastrointestinal symptoms
(nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain), and
lethargy or malaise as well as shortness of breath,
cough, and sore throat.2 Less often, HSR may include
edema, hypotension, and lesions of mucous membranes.4–6 The symptoms worsen with continued
therapy but generally resolve within 24 hours after
treatment discontinuation.3 HSR symptoms can
resemble those related to HIV, opportunistic infections, or adverse reactions to other antiretroviral
medications.5

Identification of HSR when it occurs is of critical
importance, not only because treatment must be
discontinued to prevent the reaction from progressing,
but also because of the danger of rechallenge.
Reinitiation following an HSR, even a mild reaction
and even at low doses of abacavir, usually results in a
return of symptoms within hours. The rechallenge
reaction may be severe, even fatal.2 Recognition of an
initial HSR is necessary to avoid rechallenge even in
patients with only mild initial reactions.
Health insurance claims data allow screening for
potential HSR among large populations of abacavir
users, permitting quantitative adverse event surveillance. Unfortunately, there is no specific ICD-9
diagnosis code for HSR, so physicians who note an
HSR event have to choose between codes for allergic
reactions, adverse drug reactions, and the specific
symptoms making up the patient’s individual reaction.
In the present study, we used recursive partitioning and
random forests techniques to develop an algorithm for
the identification of HSR from claims data, using HSR
events that were validated through medical record
review as the ‘gold standard.’
METHODS
The present study used data from a larger study
conducted in parallel with three other databases to
provide postmarketing surveillance for abacavir HSR
(unpublished data, GlaxoSmithKline; poster presented
at the 3rd IAS Conference on HIV Pathogenesis and
Treatment, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, July 2005). The
larger study found no difference in risk of initial
and rechallenge HSR, HSR-related hospitalization,
and HSR-related death between users of Ziagen1
(abacavir alone) and Trizivir1 (abacavir, lamivudine,
and zidovudine in a combination tablet). We screened
for potential HSR events through the insurance claims
data and validated events by an expert panel’s review
of the abstracted medical record. In order to achieve
high sensitivity for detecting HSR, we reviewed a
large number of records of persons with claims for any
condition that might be a component of HSR. The
diagnoses and procedures included in the screening
algorithm are shown in Table 1. The present paper
reports our further development of an algorithm with
similar sensitivity but much better specificity for
identifying initial HSR events through claims data.

We included data from abacavir users in health plans
in 14 states. We searched the outpatient pharmacy
records of all commercial plan members with both
medical and prescription drug coverage for abacavir
dispensings. The analyses included patients who
received their first dispensing of abacavir between
1 January 1999 and 31 July 2003. We required that
subjects have a minimum of 6 months of continuous
enrollment in the health plan prior to their first
dispensing of abacavir in the database. We extracted
all health care claims records for these subjects,
including medical and laboratory services, hospitalizations, and drug dispensings from 1 July 1998 to
31 December 2003. Drug data include the date, form,
dose, quantity, and days supply for each dispensing.
Outcome identification
Identified abacavir initiators were considered at risk
for HSR for 90 days after initiation of a course of
therapy, because almost all HSR reported to date has
occurred during this interval.1 For completeness, we
also searched for potential events associated with
discontinuations even beyond the 90-day period. The
original claims screening for potential events included
any one HSR-related symptom, diagnosis, or procedure, noted in Table 1. The potential event was
required to occur during or within 14 days after the
period of abacavir exposure and could not be followed
by an uneventful refill of abacavir. Potential events
identified from the claims were validated through
review of medical claims, medical record abstraction,
and review by a panel of four clinical HIV specialists.
The expert panel evaluated all potential cases,
classifying them as definite, probable or possible, or
not cases of HSR. Definite events required a

subsequent positive rechallenge, but probable and
possible events did not.
Baseline variables
We noted each abacavir user’s history of dispensings of
other antiretroviral medications and diagnoses of
AIDS-defining illnesses during the 6 months preceding
the start of abacavir. These variables were coded as
dichotomous indicators for prior antiretroviral experience and claims for any one or more AIDS-defining
illnesses (based on the CDC’s 1993 revised classification system6). We also recorded each patient’s gender
and age on the date of first dispensing of abacavir.
Claims indicators of HSR
A discontinuation in abacavir, with or without
symptoms of HSR, that was followed by a reinitiation
of the drug without any sign of an adverse reaction was
deemed event-free. Symptoms were considered to be
potentially abacavir-related only if they occurred during
a risk period for HSR that comprised the days from the
date of last abacavir dispensing through 14 days
following the end of the supply dispensed. The only
exception to this rule was one patient who was later
rechallenged; because our goal was to characterize
initial HSR, we used the last dispensing prior to the
initial event to calculate this individual’s risk period.
During each subject’s risk period, we created
flags indicating presence or absence of each of
the diagnoses and procedures listed in Table 1. An
additional flag indicated the occurrence of a discontinuation in abacavir supply of at least 14 days, in the
absence of, or prior to, completing a continuous course
of greater than 90 days. To identify non-HSR related
diagnoses that might provide alternative explanations
for any HSR-related claims, we also searched the
claims for all diagnoses given from the date of first
potential HSR symptom to 14 days following the latest
potential HSR symptom. The 30 most common
diagnoses given to patients during this time period
were flagged, as were hospitalization and death during
the same period. All of the variables that were deemed
potential alternative explanations for HSR-related
symptoms were entered into the analysis.
Data analysis
We used recursive partitioning7 to find the optimal
combinations of predictors of HSR. All potential
covariates including the baseline variables,

or within 2 weeks after the patient’s last abacavir fill,
and alternative diagnoses given during or following
the potential event were used in a recursive partitioning analysis using CART software (version 5.0,
Salford Systems, San Diego). The classification trees
were constructed using 10-fold cross-validation; the
data were randomly divided into 10 subsets, with
each subset used as a test case against which to judge a
tree based on the remaining nine subsets. The final
tree was an aggregate of each of the 10 learning trees.
In an effort to ensure high sensitivity of the model,
we set the cost of misclassification of an HSR event
as a non-event to twice as great as the cost of a
misclassification of a non-event as an event.
In addition to the 10-fold cross-validation, we used
two bootstrap resampling methods8 to confirm the
variable selection, and sensitivity and specificity
estimates. The first used 1000 bootstrap samples of
the data (i.e., sampling with replacement) and the tree
obtained from the recursive partitioning analysis to
obtain 95% confidence intervals around the sensitivity
and specificity for that analysis. The second analysis
was conducted using random forests with Salford
Systems’ software. Random forests is an ensemble
method in which a large number of trees are constructed. Both individuals and variables are sampled.
The ultimate classification of an observation is
obtained by a majority vote of the individual trees.
Our validation procedure involved taking 1000 bootstrap samples. Each bootstrap sample leaves out on
average about one-third of the study population; the
individuals who are left out of the bootstrap training
sample are used to estimate the accuracy of the tree
and the importance of each variable in the model.
RESULTS
A total of 948 individuals initiated abacavir during the
study period and met the enrollment criterion of a
minimum of 6 months of continuous enrollment prior
to the start of abacavir. A total of 101 patients had one
or more events flagged by our initial claims screening
as potential HSR. Medical records for 14 of these
individuals were not available for abstraction; these
14 patients were dropped from all further analyses,
leaving 934 subjects. Based on information from both
claims and abstracted medical records, 22 subjects had
an event that was judged by the expert medical review
board to be possible or probable HSR, with no events
judged definite HSR. Table 2 presents baseline
characteristics of patients with and without subsequent
HSR events. Most subjects were male (85%), received
other antiretroviral treatments in the 6 months prior to

demonstrated excellent sensitivity and specificity
(95% and 93%, respectively). The variables used to
partition the sample fell into two main groups:
diagnoses of specific symptoms that can occur with
HSR and diagnosis codes that were presumably
meant to indicate a diagnosis of HSR. The five specific
symptoms that were identified, which included fever,
headache, nausea, malaise, and rash, each contributed
to the model individually (i.e., not as interactions)
and all were low in prevalence. To construct a
more parsimonious model, we created a combined
variable indicating the presence of any one or more of
the five symptoms. Similarly, the diagnoses of adverse
effect of drug, anaphylactic shock, and unspecified
allergy formed a combined flag that was set to one if
any of the three diagnoses were present.
Figure 1 shows the final classification tree obtained
by using the combined variables. The first predictor
selected was the presence of any of the five symptoms
of fever, headache, nausea, malaise, and rash. The
73 patients with at least one of these symptoms split on
whether they had a discontinuation of abacavir
dispensings prior to completion of a 90-day course;
18 of 22 HSR events met both of these criteria.
Patients lacking any of the five symptoms were
classified as having HSR if they had a diagnosis of
adverse effect of drug, unspecified allergy, or
anaphylactic shock; this criterion correctly classified
three of the remaining four events. Only one HSR

event failed to be identified by any of the predictors in
the model. The three variables found in the decision
nodes carried almost all of the importance in the
model; in rank order from most to least important,
the variables were the five specific symptoms, adverse
drug event or allergy, and discontinuation in abacavir.
The model correctly classified 21 of 22 (95.5%) HSR
events and 863 of 912 (94.6%) non-events. Application of the tree to 1000 bootstrap samples of the data
produced 95% confidence intervals of 83.3% to
100.0% for sensitivity and 93.1% to 96.1% for
specificity.
The random forests bootstrap resampling approach,
which was performed using all of the variables that
were entered into the recursive partitioning model,
obtained the same three most important variables as
the recursive partitioning model, with the same order
of importance. The random forests procedure, which
provides unbiased estimates of sensitivity and
specificity,8 showed the same level of sensitivity as
the recursive partitioning model (95.5%) and slightly
lower specificity (90.4%).

DISCUSSION
The recursive partitioning analysis was successful in
creating a highly sensitive and specific algorithm for
identifying HSR from claims data alone. Bootstrap

abacavir hypersensitivity
resampling, using two different methods, confirmed
the variable importance levels, and the high sensitivity
and specificity. Patients with a claims diagnosis of
fever, headache, nausea, malaise, or rash and who also
had a discontinuation in abacavir without having
completed a continuous 90-day course were very
likely to have had a validated HSR event. Patients with
none of the five symptoms but who had a diagnosis of
adverse effect of drug, unspecified allergy, or
anaphylactic shock were also likely to have an HSR
event.
Although we had included numerous diagnoses
that occurred during or after the potential HSR event
in an effort to identify alternative explanations for
HSR-related diagnoses and symptoms that were not in
fact reflective of HSR, none of these diagnoses
appeared to be an important differentiator in the
recursive partitioning model. Instead, only symptoms
and diagnoses that are clearly relevant to a positive
diagnosis of HSR entered the final model. Some
diagnoses, such as pneumonia or septicemia, appeared
only in noncases and thus could be considered as
indicating differential diagnoses, but they may have
been too infrequent and/or occurred only in patients
lacking the positive predictors of HSR used in the
model and hence did not help to differentiate noncases
from cases.
The number of validated HSR cases on which the
present algorithm was built was small. It is thus quite
possible that additional claims flags for HSR could
be identified in a larger sample of events. Only one
case failed to be identified from the five characteristics
in the algorithm, but 49 nonevents were predicted by
the algorithm to be events. The positive predictive
value of the algorithm was 30%, indicating that 70%
of predicted cases were false positives. Patients
flagged by this algorithm as having HSR should
therefore be considered to be at substantial likelihood
having suffered HSR but not as definite cases. These
individuals would be highly appropriate candidates for
medical chart review. Our estimate of sensitivity of the
model may be an overestimate, because we did not
abstract medical records for individuals who had no
claims for any of the diagnoses or procedures listed in
Table 1.
The diagnoses of adverse drug effect, anaphylactic
shock, and allergy are those we had believed most
likely to be used by physicians attempting to note an
observed HSR event in the claims. Although only
three HSR events were classified in the tree on the
basis of one of these diagnoses, a count of patients
with HSR who received such a diagnosis either with or
without one of the five symptoms revealed that the
Copyright # 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

295

majority (64%) had one of the HSR-indicating codes.
This high proportion suggests that physicians were
likely to have recognized and made an effort to record
in the claims the incidence of the adverse reaction.
Over a third of the HSR events found in the present
study, however, were indicated only by one or more of
the symptoms that were components of the individual
patient’s reaction. The physicians may have failed to
recognize the event as an abacavir HSR or may not
have chosen a diagnosis code for the claims that
directly signaled an adverse or allergic reaction. Since
medical claims are being used more and more for
research into drug safety and other important public
health issues, it may be beneficial for physicians
prescribing abacavir to receive additional guidance
regarding the most appropriate claims diagnoses to use
in cases of HSR.
The ultimate goal of an algorithm such as this is to
provide a means of easily monitoring the claims of
abacavir users for potential HSR, not only among
United Healthcare members but in other claims
databases as well. Before reaching this goal, the
algorithm needs to be tested in one or more additional
databases to determine the extent to which it
accurately captures events that have been validated
through medical records or other external sources of
information. If the algorithm performs well, our
algorithm or a refinement of it based on additional
data may be helpful in ongoing surveillance for cases
of abacavir HSR. Such large-scale surveillance
efforts can allow monitoring for changes in the
incidence of this adverse event; by linking to other
information in the claims data, possible causes for
any increase or decrease in incidence can be found.
Definitive ascertainment of HSR events will of
course require supplemental information, but a
generalizable claims algorithm can generate timely
signals for potential public health problems or
improvements with regard to abacavir adverse
reactions.

KEY POINTS
 Identification of HSR to abacavir is important to
avoid rechallenge.
 Claims data allow monitoring of large numbers
of antiretroviral drug users.
 We developed a sensitive and specific algorithm
for the identification of abacavir HSR from
claims data.
