Abstract
Purpose Data mining in spontaneous reporting databases
generates large numbers of signals of disproportionate
reporting (SDRs) that need to be prioritised for assessment.
The pharmacological relevance of drug–event associations is
not considered in SDR prioritisation algorithms. This aimed to
propose and test a pharmacological score for SDR
prioritisation.
Methods The Pharmacological Score for SDRs Prioritisation
(PS-SP) was developed using a Delphi approach. An expert
group agreed that PS-SP should include general criteria
concerning SDRs and criteria concerning pharmacological

relevance, and that criteria should be weighted for their risk
representation. Once defined, the PS-SP was tested for
prioritisation of SDRs for extrapyramidal syndrome in the
French Pharmacovigilance database; the SDR classification
was compared to that obtained using a traditional
disproportionality approach.
Results For a given drug, the general criteria retained were the
reporting rate of the adverse drug reaction (ADR) and value of
the 95% confidence interval (CI) lower boundary of the
Reporting Odds Ratio (ROR). Pharmacological criteria
consisted of the ADR reporting rate without concomitant atrisk drugs or those indicated for ADR treatment, and the value
of the ROR 95% CI lower boundary as estimated in the subset
of reports concerning drugs from the same therapeutic and
then pharmacological class. Compared with traditional
disproportionality, PS-SP prioritised specific drugs within
congeners: metoclopramide, indoramin, and trimetazidine appeared as outliers within their classes; conventional antipsychotics had higher prioritisation than atypical antipsychotics.
Conclusion The pilot evaluation of PS-SP performed in extrapyramidal syndrome advocates for the use of pharmacological criteria in SDR prioritisation algorithms.

Introduction
Automated data mining procedures are routinely used to support manual revision in identifying potential safety signals
from spontaneous reporting data [1]. These mostly consist of
disproportionality analyses that compare the proportion of
reports of an adverse drug reaction (ADR) for a specific drug
within a database with that for all other drugs in that database
[2]. Although they improve the sensitivity of signal detection,

618

they are plagued by several biases and lead to decreased
specificity in safety signal detection [3–8]. The latter is related
to the large volume of potential signals detected, termed
signals of disproportionate reporting (SDRs) [9], that all need
to be subjected to expert-assessment phases to sort potentially
relevant SDRs from spurious ones. As the number of detected
SDRs is high, this triage activity is time consuming and may
delay identification and assessment of potentially important
SDRs. To minimise this possibility and optimise the efficiency
of pharmacovigilance in its role of surveillance [10], several
triage algorithms have been developed to help safety officers
prioritise SDRs for assessment [11–15]. These algorithms
consider the potential health impact of drug–event associations, their novelty, their echo in the media or specific regulator attention, and the strength of evidence that can support
them. In these algorithms, however, no criterion focuses on
the pharmacological strength and specificity of the association. Yet such criteria could help identify SDRs for which the
drug involved constitutes an outlier with regards to related
drugs or therapeutic alternatives, which might provide crucial
information for SDR prioritisation.
In the context of the ARITMO project, which focuses on
drug-induced ventricular arrhythmias (www.aritmo-project.
org) [16, 17], we aimed to develop and test a prioritisation
algorithm that would consider, in addition to traditional
indicators, the pharmacological relevance and originality of
the detected SDRs. Our findings are presented herein.

of a criterion (Ci), normalization (nCij) was obtained using the
Cij−Cimin
following formula: nCij ¼ Cimax−Cimin
The second step consisted of attributing a weight to each of
the listed criterion in order to reflect its ability to represent the
association of the drug to the studied ADR. This was achieved
following a Delphi approach structured in three rounds (each
member replied blinded to answers of the other members). In
the first round, all members of the panel independently allocated a weight from 0.1 to 1 to each criterion. After studying
the distribution of assigned values, the median of the weights
attributed to each criterion was estimated, and the first quartile
to median and median to third quartile defined. In the second
round, these median values were communicated to members
of the panel who were then asked whether this reflected their
opinion or whether they would rather allocate a weight less or
equal to (≤) or greater or equal to (≥) the median score. If their
answers were equally distributed around the median value, the
median value was considered as the final weight for the
criterion, and the approach ended; if answers were unequally
distributed, a third round was initiated for criteria concerned.
This procedure continued until expert opinions were equally
distributed around the value.
The defined weights (w) were applied to the retained
criteria (C); for Drug (Dj), PS-SP could be calculated as
follows: PS-SP (Dj)=w1(nC1j)+w2(nC2j)+…+wn(nCnj)

Methods
Definition of the Pharmacological Score for Signals
of disproportionate reporting Prioritisation (PS-SP)
The Pharmacological Score for Signals of disproportionate
reporting Prioritisation (PS-SP) was developed following a
two-step procedure. The first step consisted of establishing a
list of potentially useful criteria to consider for SDR
prioritisation regarding pharmacological aspects. We used a
Delphi approach that allows converging opinions from an
expert panel to be obtained [18]. This step was performed
among the pharmacovigilance partners of the ARITMO project, constituting the expert panel, who proposed and defined
criteria on the basis of their personal experience. The Delphi
group agreed on the need to integrate: (i) general criteria,
taking into account the global context of SDR detection, (ii)
pharmacological criteria that allow pharmacological relevance
of the information to be identified and thus strengthen the
potential specificities of the drug’s effect. As each quantitative
criterion could have a different metric and range of variation, it
was decided to use normalised values to make indicators
comparable with one another. For each estimated value (Cij)

In order to test PS-SP validity, the score was used to class
SDRs of extrapyramidal syndrome as detected from French
spontaneous reporting data. We chose extrapyramidal syndrome for this study, as it does not constitute an ARITMO
event of interest, and we wanted to first evaluate the performance of the PS-SP before it application but also because the
antidopaminergic effect and related ability of the main drugs
known to cause extrapyramidal syndrome is well established
and could be used to evaluate the performance of PS-SP
prioritisation.
This analysis concerned all reports collected in the French
research pharmacovigilance database (BNPV-R), which includes all reports entered into the Base Nationale de
Pharmacovigilance (BNPV) [4] between January 2000 and
August 2010 and in which all ADRs are coded by each
regional centre using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory
Activities (MedDRA), 13th edition. The Anatomical
Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classification system is used to
code suspected and concomitant drugs. To focus on a homogeneous set of substances, we considered reports related to
medicines and excluded reports mentioning vaccines, illicit
drugs, herbal medicines, homeopathy, and toxins.
All reports mentioning an ADR related to extrapyramidal
syndrome were considered as cases [19, 20]. To identify them

Eur J Clin Pharmacol (2014) 70:617–625

in the BNPV-R, we used the Standardised MedDRA Query
(SMQ) “extrapyramidal syndrome” in its narrow version to
favour specificity in ADR identification. All drugs available in
the database were considered. For each drug, ATC codes were
used to identify exposed reports, i.e., those mentioning the use
of the drug among the suspected drug(s), with corresponding
ATC code. The algorithm chosen for SDR detection was the
Reporting Odds Ratio (ROR) of the case/noncase method [2];
SDRs were detected only for drugs with three or more exposed cases of extrapyramidal syndrome.
Pharmacological Score for Signals of disproportionate
reporting Prioritisation (PS-SP) calculation and performance
examination
The PS-SP of extrapyramidal syndrome was estimated for
each drug for which at least three exposed cases of extrapyramidal syndrome, identified as previously described, were
found in the database. Prioritisation obtained using PS-SP
for drugs associated with extrapyramidal syndrome was compared with that obtained by prioritisation using the ROR
value. The intraclass prioritisation obtained for antipsychotics
and antidepressants was then examined according to existing
knowledge on these drugs.

Results
Pharmacological Score for Signals of disproportionate
reporting Prioritisation (PS-SP): criteria and weighting
Five criteria were retained for SDR prioritisation: (i) case rates
and the 95% confidence interval (CI) for the lower ROR
boundary, considered as general criteria for SDR
prioritisation; (ii) case rates without other drugs (both
suspected and concomitant) that could induce the ADR or
be indicated ADR treatment, and the 95% CI lower ROR
boundary calculated in subsets of reports concerning related
drug classes or subclasses considered as pharmacological
criteria for SDR prioritisation.
General Criteria for Signal of Disproportionate Reporting
Prioritisation
The first criterion (C1) consisted of the reporting rate of the
ADR of interest among reports mentioning a given drug. The
second criterion (C2) considered the estimator used to detect
SDRs in a given spontaneous reporting database. It consisted
of the quantitative value of the measure used to determine the
significance of this estimator for the drug–event pair of interest. According to the signal detection algorithm used, this
would, for instance, correspond to the quantitative value of
the of the 95% CI lower boundary of the ROR, of the 95% CI

619

lower boundary of the Proportional Reporting Ratio [21], of
the 2.5 % quantile (Q0.025) of the Information Component, or
to the 5 % quantile (Q0.05) of distribution for the Gamma
Poisson Shrinker method [22].
Pharmacological Criteria for Signal of Disproportionate
Reporting Prioritisation
The third criterion (C3) consisted of the reporting rate of the
ADR of interest among reports mentioning a given drug, as
estimated when considering only reports of the ADR not
mentioning the main drugs known to cause it or to be indicated for its treatment (known or indicated drugs). The fourth
criterion (C4) considered, for a given drug, the quantitative
value of the measure used to determine the significance of this
estimator for the drug–event pair of interest as estimated in the
subset of reports from the database mentioning drugs from the
same therapeutic class. These were defined as the drugs belonging to the same second level of the ATC classification
(e.g. for haloperidol: psycholeptic, ATC code N05). The fifth
criterion (C5) considered this value as estimated in the subset
of reports mentioning drugs from the same pharmacological
class (e.g. for haloperidol: antipsychotics, ATC code N05A).
After attributing weight to each of the retained criteria, the
final PS-SP equation for a given drug j (Dj) was: PS-SP (Dj)=
0.7(nC1j)+0.95(nC2j)+0.5(nC3j)+0.5(nC4j)+0.7(nC5j)
The proposed PS-SP can thus take values ranging from 0 to
3.35.
Practical application
The practical application considered prioritisation of SDRs for
extrapyramidal syndrome. Among the 195,487 reports included in the BNPV-R, 1,868 were related to extrapyramidal
syndrome. The list of known or indicated drugs defined for
this ADR [23] is detailed in Table 1. Of the 447 individual
drugs mentioned in the reported cases, 156 were mentioned in
at least three cases, 78 of which were associated with an SDR
according to the ROR and its 95% CI lower boundary. Among
these drugs, the PS-SP value ranged from 0.07
(bromocriptine) to 3.04 (metoclopramide); the median value
was 0.29 (ketamine). The complete list of drugs with at least
three reported cases of extrapyramidal syndrome is reported in
Online Resource 1, with number of cases, total number of
reports, existence of SDR, PS-SP values, and weighted PS-SP
criteria values.
Table 2 reports the first 40 drugs associated with a SDR for
extrapyramidal syndrome classified according to PS-SP.
Among the top ten drugs, prioritisation was similar to that
obtained when considering ROR value only, except for
indoramin, which was number eight for prioritisation with
PS-SP and no. 26 according to ROR. Among the top 40 drugs
with SDR for extrapyramidal syndrome, discordances

between PS-SP and ROR prioritisation exceeding ten positions were found for metopimazine (no. 12 vs. no. 23),
trimetazidine (no. 13 vs. no. 42), alimemazine (no. 19 vs.
no. 33), mepivacaine (no. 24 vs. no. 40), thioridazine (no. 25

vs. no. 52), and ketamine (no. 39 vs. no. 64).
Among drugs with at least three reported cases but no SDR
according to ROR, three had PS-SP value higher than or equal
to the median PS-SP value in drugs with SDR (namely,
enalapril, misoprostol, and terbutaline). Antipsychotics and
antidepressants were the drug classes associated with the
highest number of SDRs (24 and 13, respectively). Twentyfour of the 25 antipsychotics with at least three reported cases
of extrapyramidal syndrome were associated with an SDR for
this ADR; their PS-SP value ranged from 2.70 (veralipride) to
0.04 (clozapine, no SDR), with a median value of 0.65
(risperidone). All atypical antipsychotics except sulpiride
had scores lower than or equal to the median PS-SP value
for antipsychotics. Aliphatic phenothiazines also obtained low
PS-SP values; high values were obtained for other phenothiazines, benzamides, and thioxanthenes (Table 3). All 13 antidepressants with at least three reported cases of extrapyramidal syndrome were associated with an SDR for this ADR;
their PS-SP values ranged from 1.40 (amoxapine) to 0.14
(escitalopram), with a median value of 0.20 (citalopram).
PS-SP prioritisation did not differentiate between tricyclic

antidepressants, monoamine-oxydase inhibitors, or selective
serotonin reuptake inhibitors (Table 4).

Discussion
The proposed PS-SP gave results for extrapyramidal syndrome that were globally coherent with a traditional
disproportionality estimator with good performance for signal
detection [24, 25] but led to classify SDRs differently. Nine of
the top ten drugs after prioritisation were common to both
methods, but certain drugs gained more than ten positions
according to PS-SP compared with ROR. Most had known
antidopaminergic properties and were not specific from a
chemical point of view (e.g. phenothiazine structure) but were
specific with regards to general properties of the therapeutic/
pharmacological class. This was the case for indoramin,
which, aside from its antiadrenergic properties, also has
antidopaminergic effects. This drug was used in France for
treating migraine but was withdrawn because of induced
parkinsonism [26]. Similarly, indications for trimetazidine
were restricted to stable angina in France in October 2012
because of induced extrapyramidal syndromes [27]. Such
results are encouraging, but it should be emphasised that we
chose extrapyramidal syndrome because the diagnosis is usually clear, and pharmacological classes likely to cause such
reactions are well characterised. However, enalapril, misoprostol, and terbutaline, for which there was no SDR, obtained
a PS-SP value higher than or equal to the median value found
for drugs that had an SDR. For these three drugs, the high PSSP value was related to the high value of the pharmacological
intraclass criterion. As there is no evidence for such findings,
these results might lead PS-SP scores related only to pharmacological intraclass criterion to be considered with a high level
of caution. This is potentially in relation to the origin of ADRs
that may be attributable to the chemical structure of the drug
and which the ATC classification system does not take
completely into account. However, this may also be precursor
evidence of a future signal, which invites longer-term scrutiny
of drugs with PS-SP value because of pharmacological
intraclass criterion but no SDR.
Other drugs were downranked by the PS-SP, e.g. thioridazine, for which data of reporting were available only for half
the study period, as the drug was withdrawn in 2005 in France.
For this drug, although the reporting rate of extrapyramidal
syndrome was high, the small number of reports led to a low
value for C4 and C5 (i.e. a low intraclass prioritisation compared with other psycholeptics and antipsychotics) and, in
turn, a low PS-SP. Furthermore, the intraclass prioritisation
for antipsychotics and antidepressants appeared consistent
with existing knowledge: atypical antipsychotics obtained
lower PS-SP than conventional ones, and PS-SP showed little
variation between antidepressants, for which the risk of

extrapyramidal syndrome is not thought to vary as much as
among antipsychotics [28, 29]. Additionally, only one antidepressant (amoxapine) was associated with a PS-SP value
exceeding that of the median value of antipsychotics, which
could indicate that interclass PS-SP is also valid. In the case of
amoxapine, the relatively high value compared with other
antidepressants could be explained by specificities of its

action compared with other antidepressants still marketed,
amoxapine being a direct antagonist of D2 and 5-HT2 receptors [30]. One unexpected finding was that aliphatic phenothiazines (e.g. acepromazine) had lower PS-SP scores than
other antipsychotics or other phenothiazines (e.g. pipotiazine).
As a similar situation was found considering ROR, this does
not seem to relate to a specific limitation of the PS-SP but

rather to the reporting profile of these drugs. As the overall
safety profile for other reports was similar for aliphatic phenothiazines and other antipsychotics, this could be related to
its use in different clinical settings or at different doses.
One potential limitation of the PS-SP is that criteria
retained for its construction are not fully independent. As
specified in the “Methods” section, this was accepted when
selecting criteria providing that it was thought that linked
criteria were supporting different information for the score.
Disproportionality measures used for pharmacological
criteria, in this perspective, are linked to rates of reporting
considered for the general criteria. However, the indicator
selected for disproportionality was the 95% CI lower boundary, which not only depends on reporting rate but also on

overall volume of reporting for a drug. Indeed, for two drugs
with a similar ADR reporting rate, the 95% CI value will differ
according to the overall volume of reporting. Similarly, as
confirmed by our results, if different disproportionality indicators retained for pharmacological criteria are linked, they
provide complementary information that helps identify potential class outliers for a given ADR.
Theoretically, this score could be interesting for all ADRs,
even if the use of ATC does not allow full investigation of its
mechanism (drug chemical structure, pharmacological action,
and/or physiochemical properties). This is because a drug with
a specific propensity to cause an ADR will be prioritised over
other drugs of the same class. It could thus be of interest to
integrate PS-SP, or a similar pharmacological assessment, to

the algorithms already used for SDR prioritisation. The advantage of PS-SP is that it can be easily automated. The only
criterion needing preliminary work is C3, as the known or
indicated drugs for a given ADR need to be identified.
However, as SDR prioritisation should primarily focus on
serious or significant medical ADRs and not on all ADRs,
this may not represent a great deal of work. It is also of note
that the influence of this criterion was minor in the practical
application presented herein. However, this should be investigated for other ADRs to determine whether this is specific to
extrapyramidal syndrome or whether it is common to others.
The main objective of the study was to define PS-SP and its
development, to which we added a preliminary evaluation of
its performance. Of course, as this preliminary validation was
performed considering only one ADR in one national database, further validation of the PS-SP is required, ideally
studying other ADRs and/or using databases from different
countries.
In conclusion, results presented here support the use of
pharmacological criteria in SDR prioritisation algorithms.
The PS-SP proposed herein could be a viable option for other
ADRs, but it needs further validation.
