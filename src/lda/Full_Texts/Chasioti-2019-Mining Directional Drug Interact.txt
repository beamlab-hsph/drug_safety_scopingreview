Abstract

Author Manuscript

Mining high-order drug-drug interaction (DDI) induced adverse drug effects from electronic
health record (EHR) databases is an emerging area, and very few studies have explored the
relationships between high-order drug combinations. We investigate a novel pharmacovigilance
problem for mining directional DDI effects on myopathy using the FDA Adverse Event Reporting
System (FAERS) database. Our work provides information on the risk of myopathy associated
with adding new drugs on the already prescribed medication, and visualizes the identified
directional DDI patterns as user-friendly graphical representation. We utilize the Apriori algorithm
to extract frequent drug combinations from the FAERS database. We use odds ratio (OR) to
estimate the risk of myopathy associated with directional DDI. We create a tree-structured graph to
visualize the findings for easy interpretation. Our method confirmed myopathy association with
previously reported HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors like rosuvastatin, fluvastatin, simvastatin and
atorvastatin. New, previously unidentified but mechanistically plausible associations with
myopathy were also observed, such as the DDI between pamidronate and levofloxacin. Additional
top findings are gadolinium-based imaging agents, which however are often used in myopathy
diagnosis. Other DDIs with no obvious mechanism are also reported, such as that of
sulfamethoxazole with trimethoprim and potassium chloride. This study shows the feasibility to
estimate high-order directional DDIs in a fast and accurate manner. The results of the analysis

Introduction

Author Manuscript

Drug interactions occur when the substances of multiple medicines affect one another
changing the effect of one or more co-administered drugs. One emerging topic in drug safety
research is the investigation of possible drug-drug interactions (DDIs) causing adverse drug
events (ADEs). Acquiring knowledge about the possible adverse effects due to drug coadministration can provide useful information for clinical applications, drug development,
the control of the ADE-associated medical cost, and safeguarding the patients’ wellbeing. In
polypharmacy situations, the information about potential DDIs becomes crucial since the
harm caused by the concomitant drug administration could outweigh the benefits.
Polypharmacy is quite common with 25-50% of patients aged 75 years or older being
exposed to at least five drugs [1].

Author Manuscript

Research on ADE detection can be broadly classified into two categories. The first category
discovers ADE patterns via analyzing health record databases [2]–[13]. For example, Harpaz
et al. [4] performed a bi-clustering analysis on the data from the Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) to identify drug groups
that share common ADEs. Tatonetti et al. [8] analyzed the FAERS data and identified 171
DDIs for eight ADEs. The second category predicts DDI patterns via integrating
biochemical and drug target data [14], [15]. For example, Zhang et al. [14] presented an
effective ensemble learning method for DDI prediction using a collection of drug data
including drug substructure, target, enzyme, transporter, pathway and other relevant data.
Ning et al. [15] developed a classification method to predict DDIs associated with an ADE
using drug similarity measures constructed from drug properties and DDI patterns. In this
work, we focus on the first category of the ADE research. In this category, most prior studies
examined the effects of single drugs (e.g., [2]–[5]) or two-way DDIs (e.g., [5]–[13]).

Author Manuscript

The investigation of DDIs involving three or more drugs (called high-order DDIs in this
work) is still an under-explored area, partially due to the computational challenge it is
facing. Since studying high-order DDIs is important, especially in situations like
polypharmacy, this topic has attracted a few recent attentions [5], [16], [17]. For example,
Harpaz et al. [5], [16] applied an association rule mining algorithm to the FAERS data for
revealing associations of multiple drugs to multiple ADEs. Similar to conventional DDI
studies, they estimated the overall effect of a drug set. However, this approach does not
allow the exploration of the relative risk between drug combinations. With this observation,
we introduce the concept of directional DDI effects, defined as the ADE risk induced by
adding one or more drugs into an existing drug combination. In a prior study [17], we
developed an approach to identify directional effects of high-order DDIs, which was

restricted to the study of adding one drug at a time to an existing drug combination. Clearly,
this method does not apply to general cases of prescribing multiple additional drugs. To
bridge this gap, in this work, we aim to extend the above method to estimate the risk of an
ADE associated with adding one or more drugs to an existing drug combination.

II.

Objective

Author Manuscript

Our objective is to examine the DDI induced ADE risk, and to investigate a novel
pharmacovigilance topic where one or more drugs are added concurrently on top of the
current medication. Given two sets of drug combinations DC1 and DC2 (superset of DC1),
we introduce a new concept of the directional DDI effect from DC1 to DC2, which is defined
as the altered ADE risk associated with the change from taking DC1 to taking DC2.
Although DC2 can contain any number of drugs, in this work, we restrict DC2 to contain up
to three drugs while DC1 up to two drugs. Thus, we are able to observe the directional effect
caused to a patient's medication, by the addition of not only one but up to three drugs at a
time. To measure the ADE risk, we use the odds ratio (OR). As seen in previous studies [17],
[18], a restriction of this analysis is the low frequency drug combinations. Including such
drug combinations in the analysis would result in misleading OR estimations. To avoid such
inaccuracies, we employ a data mining technique to exclude the infrequent drug
combinations from our analysis and only focus on the analysis of frequent drug
combinations. We calculate the OR of the ADE for adding one, two, or three drugs in the
patients’ medication and visualize the results as an intuitive tree.

Author Manuscript

To demonstrate the proposed strategy, we analyze data from the publicly available Food and
Drug Administration (FDA) Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) [19]. The widely
used FAERS, is a valuable source of information about ADEs. Specifically, we use FAERS
to examine the risk of DDI induced myopathy.
Myopathy is unexpected muscle toxicity with primary symptoms that of muscle weakness,
pain, and even tissue break down. The prevalence of drug-induced myopathies, one of the
most common causes of muscle diseases, has been estimated to be more than 2,000 per
100,000 individuals in the Western Hemisphere [20]. Myopathy has been mainly associated
with statin medication, and is one of the major reasons of statin-medication discontinuation
[21]–[24]. Based on the Side Effect Resource (SIDER) database [25], among the 99
registered myopathy-related drugs, 8% are statins. In addition to statins, glucocorticoidinduced myopathy due to decreased protein synthesis and increased rate of protein
catabolism, has also been observed [26]. We study the proposed novel pharmacovigilance
problem, using myopathy as a testbed.

Materials and Methods
Data preparation
Our analysis is based on the publicly available FAERS data collected between Q1 2004 and
Q3 2012. Before its structure update in 2013, FAERS was based on case reports, containing
one or more reports for each individual, submitted at different time points. In our analysis,
we only retained the most recent report for each individual. The processed FAERS data

contain 4,077,447 ADE reports, and 1,763 FDA approved drugs. After processing the
original FAERS dataset, we created a dataset where each record is a report containing the
administered drugs and the ADEs. To avoid the confusion between a cause and a bystander,
in our analysis, only the primary and secondary suspects were included, and drugs labeled as
“concomitant” or “interacting” were excluded. A record containing myopathy as an ADE
was labeled as myopathy; and otherwise as non-myopathy. Out of 4,077,447 events, there
are 136,860 myopathy events. In our data, the number of drugs in a record ranges from 1 to
103. We only extracted the frequent drug combinations, based on which, we calculated
directional DDI effects. Fig. 1 shows the flowchart of our analysis.

Directional drug interaction effects

Author Manuscript

We define the directional DDI effect as the ADE risk change introduced by adding new
drugs to an existing drug combination. We use the odds ratio (OR) as a measure of the ADE
risk (see Table I). Here, individuals with myopathy are considered as cases whereas,
individuals without myopathy are considered as controls. The OR is calculated as the ratio
of odds of the exposed individuals with myopathy over the odds of the exposed individuals
without myopathy. Exposed individuals are defined as those who take a specific drug
combination D1,…, Di, Di+1,…, DN; while unexposed individuals are those taking D1,…, Di
but not taking at least one of the Di+1,…, DN. For example, the odds of taking ABC over the
odds of taking C gives the directional effect of adding AB to C. To calculate the OR of
myopathy for individuals taking a drug combination ABC versus those taking only C, we set
the exposed group to be those who take any drug combination containing ABC and the
unexposed group to be those who take any drug combination containing C but not ABC
together (i.e., C, CA, or CB).

Extraction of frequent itemsets
The existing low-frequency drug combinations would result in misleading OR results. To
exclude these infrequent combinations, we applied the Apriori algorithm [27]. Apriori is a
data mining technique used for identifying frequent itemsets and association rules in
transactional data sets. Using a bottom-up approach, the algorithm starts by identifying all
frequent one-element itemsets. All the frequent itemsets are extended one item at a time to
form new candidate itemsets, given that the subsets of a frequent itemset must also be
frequent. The occurrence of each candidate itemset is counted using the database to identify
frequent ones. This procedure continues until no new extension can be found.

Author Manuscript

In the processed FAERS data set, a record can be considered as a transaction and a drug
combination as an itemset. In Fig. 2, a simple flowchart of the algorithm is presented. For
each of the drug combinations (itemsets), the number of its occurrences (support) is
calculated. Given a user-specified minimum support (MinSup), a drug combination is
frequent, if it appears at least as many times as the MinSup value. Apriori was applied using
the arules package in R. In this work, Apriori identified 764 frequent 1-drug combinations,
7,036 frequent 2-drug combinations and 4,280 frequent 3-drug combinations.

Identifying drug interactions

Author Manuscript

For each frequent drug combination DC2, containing up to three drugs, and each of its subset
DC1 (i.e., DC1 ⊂ DC2), we calculate the OR of the myopathy risk associated with the
directional DDI from DC1 to DC2. For convenience, we call DC1 as baseline if DC1 is
empty (i.e., none of the DC2 drugs are in DC1). Specifically, the OR is calculated based on
the formula OR = ad/bc (see Table I) for the following directional effects: 1) baseline to 1drug, 2) baseline to 2-drugs, 3) baseline to 3-drugs, 4) 1-drug to 2-drugs, 5) 1-drug to 3drugs, and 6) 2-drugs to 3-drugs. Here, a represents the count of frequent myopathy itemsets
containing all the drugs in DC2, b is the count of frequent non-myopathy itemsets containing
all the drugs in DC2, c represents the count of frequent myopathy itemsets containing all the
drugs in DC1, and d is the count of frequent non-myopathy itemsets containing all the drugs
in DC1.

Author Manuscript

Because the myopathy events in our data constitute only 3.5% of all the ADEs, there are
drug combination instances where the number of non-myopathy events far exceeds the
number of the myopathy events. A big disproportionality between the case and control
number could be another source of unreliable OR results. To address this issue, we set an
additional constraint regarding the minimum acceptable number of cases (exposed and
unexposed myopathy events). Under these two constraints, we estimate all possible
directional effects related to the subsets of each frequent drug set containing up to 3 drugs.
For example, for a three-drug set ABC, we calculate the OR for each of the following
directional effects:

The results are corrected for multiple comparisons (Bonferroni correction) and ordered by
their ORs.

Visualization of directional drug interactions

Author Manuscript

Let S be a frequent drug set and C = {x ∣ x ⊆ S} be the set of all of its subsets. Given S, we
can generate a tree to organize and visualize all possible directional DDIs between relevant
sets in C. Specifically, each node represents a drug combination. An edge from the node
DC1 to the node DC2 \ DC1 indicates the directional DDI of DC1 → DC2 where DC1 ⊂
DC2 ⊆ S. D3: Data-Driven Documents (http://d3js.org/) is used to plot such a tree. Examples
of tree visualization are shown in Figs. 3-6. The value shown on each node indicates the OR
of the myopathy risk associated with taking the drug(s) on the current node in addition to the
drug(s) on the previous node. The node size is proportional to the OR, while the node color

Results
Data summary
The processed FAERS dataset used, contains 4,077,447 records, among which 136,860 are
myopathy events, and 3,940,587 are non-myopathy ones. From the 1,763 different drugs in
the dataset, 75 have myopathy-related effects. We applied Apriori [27] to our data by setting
MinSup=1,000, and we identified 764 frequent single drugs, 7,527 frequent drug pairs, and
4,280 frequent drug triplets.

Drug Interactions
The top 100 results for single drug versus baseline, are shown in Table S1, with OR values
ranging from 5.57 to 2.18. The top drug is gadoteridol with OR=5.57, meaning that the odds
of myopathy in patients taking gadoteridol is 5.57 times higher than in patients not taking it.
Nicorandil, ranked ninth in the list, is a vasodilator used for treating angina pectoris. In
2014, specific batches of this drug were withdrawn from the market after FDAs decision.
Although, myopathy is not one of its known side effects, cases of weakness have been
reported.

Author Manuscript

For two-drugs versus the baseline, the top 100 results are shown in Table S2. The OR values
vary from 21.56 to 7.63. The top result here is the combination of simvastatin and
clarithromycin with OR=21.56. Second and third in the list are the simvastatin-cyclospirine
and the pamidronate-levofloxacin combinations, with OR values 17.69 and 16.36
respectively. Also, the combination of azithromycin and zoledronate (ranked 4th), shows an
OR of 15.86. All these results are statistically significant, after correcting for multiple
comparisons.

Author Manuscript

Table II presents the top 10 findings of comparing drug triplets with the baseline. The OR
estimates range from 19.51 to 14.85. Most of the results here are similar to those of Table S2
with the addition of pain reliever (oxycodone or acetaminophen) or gabapentin (which may
also be used to treat neuropathic pain). For example, the top result is the combination of
oxycodone, zoledronate and levofloxacin (OR=19.51). A similar combination also appears
in the comparison of drug pairs to the baseline. Specifically, it was estimated that individuals
taking both zoledronate and levofloxacin have an OR=12.61, which is the 11th highest OR
(Table S2). We also observe a statistically significant risk of myopathy when zoledronate
(belonging to the bisphosphonates drug class and used to treat bone diseases) is administered
with pamidronate and zolpidem (Fig. 3). Based on the FAERS data, the risk of myopathy
when co-administering these drugs, is 15.92 (p-value<1.17e-05; right hand side of inequality
is the Bonferroni p-value threshold. See Table II). To the best of our knowledge, there is
neither any previous study nor any report indicating an interaction between these drugs (mild
myalgia is an ADE of zoledronate). Also, in our results, dexamethasone is frequently
implicated in the risk of myopathy by interacting with drugs like gabapentin-zoledronate

(Fig. 4), levofloxacin-zoledronate, and lorazepam-zoledronate. Again, to our knowledge,
there are not known interactions between these individual drugs and dexamethasone. The
ORs of myopathy when comparing each of these 3-drug combinations to the risk of only
taking dexamethasone are 16.76, 13.34 and 12.12 respectively.
For two-drug versus one-drug combinations (Table S4), some results confirm the wellstudied association between the CYP3A and statins. Specifically, we observe a statistically
significant OR of 20.21 when adding simvastatin on top of cyclosporine (ranked 4th with pvalue < the Bonferroni threshold of 3.59e-06) and when adding simvastatin on top of
clarithromycin (ranked 9th with OR=13.50 and p-value < the Bonferroni threshold of
3.59e-06). The OR values of this table range from 28.21 to 6.73, with the top result
(OR=28.21) being that of gadobenate dimeglumine and gadopentetate dimeglumine versus
gadobenate dimeglumine.

Author Manuscript

Tables III and IV present the top 10 results of drug triplets versus one drug and two drugs
respectively. In Tables III, the OR values range from 20.31 to 13.06, with the gadolinium
contrast agents occupying the top positions, while in Table IV the OR values range from
34.43 to 11.22.
C.

Visualization of directional drug interactions

Author Manuscript

An important aspect of this study is the extended visualization of the DDI that allows
tracking down the whole DDI path of the final result. For an n-drug combination (D1,…Dn),
we start from a baseline node (none of D1,…, Dn are taken) and we generate all possible
paths up to n-drugs along with the corresponding ORs. For example, for the zoledronatepamidronate-zolpidem combination, a tree visualization of all the directional DDIs is
presented in Fig. 3. For patients at the baseline (none of the 3 drugs are taken), the OR of
myopathy when adding zoledronate is 2.4, indicating that zoledronate is a risk factor (red
color). Notice that, for the baseline individuals who are prescribed simultaneously zolpidem
and zoledronate, the OR is higher (OR=9.83), as indicated by a larger node in the graph. If
now, on top of zoledronate, we prescribe pamidronate, the OR becomes 2.55 (baseline →
zoledronate: 2.4 → pamidronate: 2.55). A similar example is also presented in Fig. 4. Given
the path baseline → dexamethasone: 1.17 → zoledronate, gabapentin: 16.76, we observe
17% increase in the risk of myopathy for patients who take dexamethason compared to those
in the baseline, while the OR is 16.76 when, on top of dexamethasone, we add zoledronate
and gabapentin. Similarly, we can follow any path in the graph to gradually understand the
impact of each drug (or drug combination) on the myopathy risk.

Discussion

A.

Novelty and Contributions
In general, the majority of the studies published in this area, are focusing on examining
interactions between two drugs. However, in cases of polypharmacy, we need to get
estimations of higher order interactions. Here, we have estimated a newly proposed
directional risk of myopathy as a result of high order DDI, based on the FAERS dataset.

Author Manuscript

We have extended our previous work [17], by removing the restriction imposed on the risk
estimation of adding one drug at a time to an existing combination. We illustrated our
methodology by estimating the OR of directional effects resulting from adding up to three
drugs at a time. We also expanded the user-friendly visualization to accommodate general
DDI patterns. In addition, we accounted for multiple comparison correction, which was
neglected in [17]. Of note, although our prior study investigated a similar problem, the
analysis was done on different data set with a smaller number of drugs.

Author Manuscript

Furthermore, we substituted an in-house R implementation of Apriori used in our previous
study [17], by a more efficient Apriori implementation in R package “arules”, which
significantly improved the computational time. Specifically, in Du et al. [17], the
experiments were performed on a Linux Xeon 64-bit dual CPU workstation, and the
computation of all frequent 3-drug combinations using a dataset of 6,388,674 events and 212
drugs, took 312.9 hours for MinSup=1, 36.4 hours for MinSup=200, and 6.5 hours for
MinSup= 1,000. In this work, with the new implementation, our experiments were
performed on a Windows 10 Enterprise 64 bit desktop with an Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-7500
CPU. We were able to obtain all frequent 3-drug combinations for a dataset of 4,077,447
events and 1,763 drugs, in 17.2 seconds for MinSup=1, 8.9 seconds for MinSup=200, and
8.4 seconds for MinSup= 1,000. To obtain all frequent 2-drug combinations, it took 8.2
seconds for any MinSup ranging from 1 to 1,000.

Author Manuscript

Ibrahim et al. [28] and Li et al. [29] also analyzed FAERS data but focused on two-way drug
interactions. Cai et al. [30] examined the adverse effect induced by three co-administered
drugs (similar to our baseline versus 3-drug combination effect) in the FAERS data, while
they did not investigate the directional DDIs. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the
first study offering estimates on high-order directional DDIs using the FAERS data.
Below, we discuss our findings, grouped into several categories: (1) gadolinium-based
imaging agents and drugs associated with diagnosis or treatment of myopathy, (2) known
myotoxic drugs or drugs with interactions known to increase the risk of myopathy, (3)
previously unidentified but mechanistically plausible interactions, and (4) previously
unidentified interactions with no obvious mechanism for increasing the risk of myopathy.
B.

Drugs associated with diagnosis and treatment of myopathy

Author Manuscript

The data in the FAERS reports do not provide the ability to evaluate the timing of drugs with
respect to the ADE manifestation. Therefore, drugs used for the diagnosis and treatment of
myopathy, not just those that could be potentially causative, may be highly associated with
the ADE. The top two agents (both gadolinium-based contrast agents) associated with
myopathy were gadoteridol and gadoversatimide (Table S1. Two other gadolinium
compounds (gadodiamide and gadobenate dimuglumine) were also in the top 10 and top 20
myopathy-associated drugs respectivelly (Table S1). These agents have been reported to
cause muscular calcification and weakness, which may present as myopathy [31]. However,
MRI is often a part of the diagnostic work-up of patients presenting with myopathy.
Therefore, it is likely that the high association between myopathy and gadolinium-based
contrast agents is due to their use in the diagnosis of myopathy. However, this does not
necessarily explain why a myopathy report would be associated with multiple gadoliniumIEEE J Biomed Health Inform. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2020 September 01.

based contrast agents nor why individuals exposed to multiple contrast agents are at
increased risk of myopathy (Tables S4 and III).
This same conclusion may be made for other drugs with high OR for myopathy, such as
chlorhexidine (Table S1 and S2, a topical antiseptic that may have been applied prior to
muscle biopsy. We also note a number of pain relievers (e.g. oxycodone, acetaminophen,
hydrocodone) among the 2-drug and 3-drug combinations associated with increased
myopathy risk. While there is some evidence of myopathy with high doses of these drugs
[32], the use of these agents to relieve myopathy symptoms cannot be ruled out.
C.

Drugs or drug interactions previously reported to increase myopathy risk

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

The presence of drugs or drug interactions that have been previously reported to increase
myopathy risk substantiates. Most noticeably, a number of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors
(Table S1) were observed to increase the risk of myopathy over baseline, including
rosuvastatin (OR=4.59 Table S1), fluvastatin (OR=4.29, Table S1), simvastatin (OR=3.98,
Table S1) and atorvastatin (OR=3.85, Table S1). We also identified increased OR for
myopathy with other lipid lowering agents, such as gemfibrozil, ezetimibe, and colesevelam.
Muscle pain, weakness, and myopathy have been reported with these drugs, and they are
also known to increase the risk of statin-induced myopathy. Our analyses also identified a
number of DDIs known to increase the risk of myopathy through well-defined mechanisms.
For instance, clarithromycin and cyclosporine are known to inhibit metabolism and
transport, respectively, of many statin drugs, including simvastatin [33] (Table S2). This
leads to increased plasma concentrations of the statin and higher risk for myopathy [34],
[35]. Additional DDIs previously linked to myopathy, which were captured by our analysis
and were highly ranked, include atorvastatin with rosuvastatin, simvastatin with gemfibrozil
and rosuvastatin with simvastatin (7th, 12th and 16th highest OR respectively, Table S2).

Author Manuscript

In order to investigate how many of the known myopathy-related findings coincide with our
results, we searched the OFFSIDES and TWOSIDES databases (both developed by Tatonetti
et al. [7]). Our analysis captured almost 92% of the drugs in OFFSIDES, that were linked to
the events of myopathy toxic and myopathy steroids (all have significant p-values). In the
TWOSIDES database, no events were found under the term “myopathy”. Hence, we focused
on myopathy-related events. Specifically, we searched for 2-drug interactions linked to
muscle weakness, rhabdomyolysis, muscle disorder, muscle paresis, muscle spasm, muscle
inflammation, musculoskeletal pain, myasthenia gravis, muscle strain, and muscle rupture.
TWOSIDES contains 32,304 unique 2-drug combinations related to the aforementioned
events. From these drug combinations, 2,906 are among our 2-drug vs. baseline results. The
ORs of myopathy in our analysis for these drug combinations range from 21.56 (i.e., for
(simvastatin, clarithromycin)) to 0.08 (i.e., for (capecitabine, cisplatin)).
While the statin interactions are widely known to be implicated to myopathy events and are
the top interactions identified among our results, it warrants further investigation to build a
complete collection of every known DDI related to myopathy. An important future direction
is to perform a comprehensive curation of relevant literature, based on which an unbiased
estimate of our method’s sensitivity can be obtained.

Previously unidentified but mechanistically plausible interactions

Author Manuscript

Although myalgia has been reported as an adverse event for the bisphosphonate
pamidronate, there is no literature evidence regarding the mechanism of the effect. However,
renal toxicity has been associated with pamidronate. In turn, renal failure is associated with
an increased risk of myopathy. Thus, it may be hypothesized that the increased risk of
myopathy with pamidronate (OR=3.59 compared to baseline; Table S1), is likely secondary
to renal failure. This hypothesis is further strengthened by the increased risk of myopathy
observed when pamidronate is found in combination with other nephrotoxic drugs (e.g. OR
of pamidronate with levofloxacin is 16.36 over baseline; Table S2; Fig. 5).
E. Previously unidentified interactions with no obvious mechanism for increased risk of
myopathy

Author Manuscript

Our analysis identified several drugs and drug combinations with high OR for myopathy not
supported by previous studies, e.g. sulfamethoxazole with trimethoprim and potassium
chloride (Table IV; Fig. 6). Another one is that of azithromycin with zoledronate (Table S2).
The mechanism for increased risk of myopathy for these drugs or drug pairs is unclear and
requires further investigation.

Conclusions

Author Manuscript

Through this work, we were able to get directional high-order drug interactions in a
computationally efficient way, by applying the Apriori algorithm for frequent itemset
identification. We calculated the OR for the directional adverse effect of myopathy for up to
three drugs at a time. Our findings confirmed well-known adverse effects of specific drug
combinations, revealed new but plausible associations, but also identified drug combinations
with no profound mechanism but warranting further investigation. Despite the valuable
knowledge hidden in the FAERS data, there is no information about the elapsed time from
the drug administration until the adverse effect manifestation. The absence of temporal
relation information, between the exposure and the event, complicates the inference process,
by introducing higher uncertainty. Thus, it is more difficult to decide whether an observed
association could potentially be causal or due to pre-existing myopathy. Examples of this
phenomenon are the findings related to gadolinium compounds, and a series of pain
relievers. Despite this limitation, we were able to confirm drug interactions previously
associated to myopathy and also reveal new drug combinations with a plausible underlying
mechanism for causing myopathy. The current methodology can be extended to higher order
drug combinations (e.g., >3 drugs), with affordable computational cost and accurate risk
estimation. That, combined with the interactive visual representation could be a valuable
tool in the specialists hands, not only for ensuring patients health but also for promoting
drug research.
