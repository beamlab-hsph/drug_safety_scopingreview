Abstract
Objectives There are no pharmacovigilance studies on adverse event (AE) data for tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNFα)
inhibitors in South Korea. We analysed AEs induced by adalimumab, infliximab, and etanercept
Methods We used data from the Korea Institute of Drug Safety and Risk Management–Korea Adverse Events Reporting System
Database (KIDS-KD) collected between 2005 and 2016. We used three different signal detection methods: proportional reporting
ratio (PRR), reporting odds ratio (ROR), and information component (IC). The drug was compared with drug labels in the USA
and Korea. Logistic regression analysis identified AEs that are more likely to occur with drug use.
Results Of the 5594 AEs identified, 350, 452, and 71 were related to adalimumab, infliximab, and etanercept, respectively. We
identified seven new signals, which were not listed on drug labels in either Korea or the USA, for AEs associated with the study
drugs: two for adalimumab (medication error and drug failure), two for infliximab (palpitation and temperature sensation
change), and three for etanercept (hyperkeratosis, acne, and thyroid neoplasm malignant). Injection site pain (OR 6.14, 95%
CI 1.15–32.74) and alopecia (OR 4.54, 95% CI 1.16–17.77) for adalimumab, chest pain (OR 6.01, 95% CI 1.35–26.77) for
infliximab, and uveitis (OR 10.11, 95% CI 1.13–90.77) for etanercept were more likely to be reported in patients with each TNFα
inhibitor than in those without, respectively.
Conclusions Seven new signals that were not included in the current label were identified for TNFα inhibitors and should be
updated and monitored.
Key Points
• Large-scale spontaneous AE reporting data and data mining techniques are useful for detecting signals of rare AEs as well as common AEs induced by
drugs.
• Drug labels should be updated to reflect signals that are newly discovered by continuous monitoring.

bowel disease, psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, hearing loss, non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis,
hidradenitis suppurativa, juvenile arthritis, and vestibular
schwannomas [1–6]. The incidence of adverse events (AEs)
was 30.6% among patients treated with infliximab,
adalimumab, or etanercept between 2006 and 2012 in a
Korean study (2014) that assessed adverse drug reactions using
an electronic medical recording system in Pusan National
University Hospital; cutaneous reactions were the most common AEs [7]. Other TNFα inhibitor-induced adverse reactions
included allergic reaction [8], infections [9, 10], and injection
site reactions, as confirmed by clinical trials and post-marketing
surveillance [11].

A pharmacovigilance study on TNFα inhibitors, which
analysed the Portuguese spontaneous reporting database between 2009 and 2011, revealed that adalimumab, etanercept,
and infliximab were all disproportionately associated with ‘infections and infestations’ and ‘benign, malignant, and unspecified neoplasms’[12]. A study in the USA that evaluated the
relationship between TNFα inhibitors and injection site reaction, using the Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event
Reporting System (FAERS) database from 2004 to 2015, confirmed that younger rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients receiving adalimumab or etanercept treatment should be closely
monitored for injection site reaction symptoms. However,
these studies do not identify AEs that are more likely to occur
with each TNFα inhibitor use [13]. Therefore, the objective of
this study is to analyse the AEs of TNFα inhibitors collected
by a spontaneous reporting system and to determine the signals of TNFα inhibitors through a comparison of the obtained
information with that on the drug labels in the USA and
Korea.

Methods
Database and study drugs
We used spontaneous AE reports from the Korea Institute of
Drug Safety and Risk Management–Korea Adverse Events
Reporting System Database (KIDS-KD) between January 1,
2005, and December 31, 2016. Drug-AE pairs were created
using one-to-one correspondence between each of the three
study drugs and each AE in order to analyse all AEs that
occurred with each drug. Between January 2005 and
December 2016, the annual proportions and annual rates of
increase in reported AE frequencies for adalimumab,
infliximab, and etanercept were determined. A comparative
analysis of the proportion of SAEs among all AEs was performed for each treatment. AEs were considered as side effects and were extracted as preferred term codes. Drug-AE
pairs were created by using one-to-one correspondence between the drugs and the AEs.

Demographic characteristics, report type,
and causality assessment
The criteria for the frequency and percentage of AE reports
were the sex and age of patients. Age was classified into four
sub-groups (< 20, 20–39, 40–59, and > 60 years of age). The
number of drug-AE pairs was tabulated by the demographic
characteristics for each study group. The data were analysed
by report type (spontaneous, research, article, or other),
submitter of the report (physician, pharmacist, nurse, patient,
or other), and the affiliation of the submitter (regional drug

Clin Rheumatol (2020) 39:347–355

safety centre, importer, medical institution, pharmacy, or
patient).
The causality of AE pairs associated with adalimumab,
infliximab, and etanercept was evaluated based on the World
Health Organization-Uppsala Monitoring Centre (WHOUMC) [14]. The evidence level was categorised into three
groups: certain, probable, and possible. The proportion of
SAEs among all AEs was analysed and compared for each
of the study drugs. SAEs associated with the study drugs were
compared by SAE type (disability, congenital deformity,
threat, death, hospitalisation, or other). Based on the AE reports, the status of the combined use of antirheumatic drugs
such as methotrexate was compared by TNFα inhibitor.

Signal indices by data mining
After acquiring all drug-AE pairs, the data mining method was
used to analyse three types of signal detection information
(Table 1). To detect the signals, the proportional reporting
ratio (PRR), reporting odds ratio (ROR), and information
component (IC) of the Bayesian confidence propagation neural network (BCPNN) were calculated [15–17]. RR is the ratio
of specific abnormal cases to specific drugs divided by the
fraction of specific abnormal cases for other drugs. The formula was [A/(A + B)]/[C/(C + D)], and the signal judgement
criteria were PRR ≥ 2, chi-square ≥ 4, and number of occurrences ≥ 3. ROR is defined as the odds of a specific abnormal
case occurring in patients exposed to a specific medicine divided by the odds of the specific abnormal case for other
medicines; the formula was (A/C)/(B/D). The signal judgement criteria were ROR ≥ 2, chi-square ≥ 4, and number of
occurrences of abnormal cases ≥ 3 based on the standard used
by KIDS [18, 19]. IC is the logarithmic value of the probability of using a certain drug multiplied by the probability of the
occurrence of a specific AE, in the case that use of that drug
and the occurrence of the particular AE are independent of
each other. IC was calculated from the formula IC =
log2P(AE, drug)/P(AE)P(drug), and the criterion was when
the lower limit of the 95% confidence interval was greater
than 0 (Table 1) [20, 21]. We defined abnormal cases as those
that satisfied one or more of these criteria as signals [22]. The
detected signals were compared with drug labels in Korea and
the USA. The US label information was obtained from the
Daily Med website [23]. Signals that were not listed on any
of the drug labels were determined to be new.

Statistical analysis
The characteristics of each variable were analysed by using
the Mantel-Haenszel chi-squared test. Differences were considered statistically significant at P values of < 0.05. The median time of all AEs from the start of drug administration to
the onset of signal detection, except for AEs without injection

time or the onset of a signal, was computed. Logistic regression analysis was conducted by controlling variables, such as
the year of reporting, age group, and type and source of reports
to compute the odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs), for the ROR of AEs due to drug use. All statistical
analyses were performed using SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc.,
Cary, NC, USA) and Excel 2010 (Microsoft Corp., Redmond,
WA, USA).

Results
Between 2005 and 2016, there were a total of 5594 AE reports
for adalimumab, infliximab, and etanercept, which
corresponded to 35,528 drug-AE pairs. After the exclusion
of data with missing age, gender, or anatomical therapeutic
chemical (ATC) and WHO-ART codes, 1439 drug-AE pairs
(100.0%) remained, which were first reports and were determined to have “possible” causality. The 1439 cases consisted
of 679 (47.2%) for adalimumab, 674 (46.8%) for infliximab,
and 86 (6.0%) for etanercept (Fig. 1). The number of AE
reports increased from 2005 to 2016 for adalimumab and
infliximab, whereas the number remained relatively stable
for etanercept (Fig. 2).
The total numbers of AE reports for adalimumab,
infliximab, and etanercept were 350, 452, and 71, respectively
(Table 1). The numbers of AE reports for adalimumab and
infliximab were similar between men and women, but a majority of etanercept AE reports was for women (63.4%). Over 70%
of the reports were issued for patients between 20 and 59 years
of age. The most common type of report was spontaneous
report for adalimumab and etanercept, but research study for
infliximab. The most frequent reporting source was physicians
for adalimumab and infliximab, and pharmacists for etanercept.
Patients were responsible for 41.8% of all AE reports for
adalimumab, but none for infliximab and etanercept. The most
frequent reporting sources were drug importers for adalimumab
and infliximab, and regional drug safety centres for etanercept.

The causality of AEs was mostly probable (220, 61.3%) or
possible (138, 38.4%) for adalimumab, probable (128, 28.2%)
or possible (293, 64.5%) for infliximab, and probable (41,
57.7%) or possible (27, 38.0%) for etanercept. SAEs
accounted for 12.6%, 21.2%, and 7.0% of AE reports for
adalimumab, infliximab, and etanercept, respectively. The
most common SAEs were disability and congenital deformity.
In combination with TNFα inhibitors and methotrexate,
infliximab (17.7%) was highest, followed by adalimumab
(15.7%) and etanercept (2.8%) (Table 2).
Of the 1439 drug-related AE pairs, 12 cases (12/679, 1.8%),
9 cases (9/674, 1.3%), and 10 cases (10/86, 11.6%) were confirmed as signals for adalimumab, infliximab, and etanercept,
respectively. The number of signals detected by PRR, ROR,
and IC, respectively, were 11, 11, and 5 for adalimumab, 7, 7,
and 5 for infliximab, and 4, 4, and 10 for etanercept. Injection
site–related cases, such as pain, rash, reaction, and pruritus,
met the criteria for each of the detection methods. In addition,
pain, increased hepatic enzyme levels, skin disorders, alopecia,
and abnormal hepatic function were confirmed as signals for
adalimumab (Table 3). Medication errors and medicine ineffectiveness for adalimumab were not listed on either the
Korean or US drug labels. Chest pain, dyspnoea, and urticaria
for infliximab satisfied all three detection criteria. Palpitation
and temperature changed sensation for infliximab were not
listed on either the Korean or US labels. Uveitis, herpes zoster,
rash, and pruritus satisfied criteria for etanercept, for all three
detection criteria. Hyperkeratosis, acne, and malignant thyroid
neoplasm were unexpected signals not found on the Korean or
US labels. Generalised and facial oedema was listed on drug
labels in Korea, but not in the USA (Table 3).
The logistic regression analysis results showed that patients
treated with adalimumab were 6.14 and 4.54 times
(significantly) more likely to present injection site pain (OR
6.14, 95% CI 1.15–32.74) and alopecia (OR 4.54, 95% CI
1.16–17.77), respectively, than those treated with other drugs.
Compared to patients treated with other drugs, patients treated
with adalimumab were also more likely to present AEs such as

Discussion
TNFα inhibitor therapy can lead to SAEs and is associated
with increased risk of serious infections and malignancies
[24–26]. As the use of TNFα inhibitors increases, concerns
regarding the AEs associated with these drugs have also increased [24–26]. The AE reports of biological drugs in other
countries have followed an upward trend [27, 28]. The present
study also revealed that the number of AE reports associated
with the three studied TNFα inhibitors in Korea increased
from 2005 to 2016, but varied by drug and fluctuated each
year. In particular, the number of AE reports on adalimumab

pain (OR 4.18, 95% CI 0.18–96.28), injection site rash (OR
2.66, 95% CI 0.60–11.78), injection site pruritus (OR 2.63,
95% CI 0.60–11.56), and skin disorder (OR 2.27, 95% CI
0.21–25.02); however, the difference was not statistically significant. Patients treated with infliximab were 6.01 times
(significantly) more likely to present chest pain (OR 6.01,
95% CI 1.35–26.77) than those treated with other drugs.
Patients treated with infliximab were also more likely to present AEs such as urticaria (OR 2.51, 95% CI 0.90–7.0) and
dyspnoea (OR 2.01, 95% CI 0.81–4.97) than those treated
with other drugs, but the difference was not statistically significant. Patients treated with etanercept were 10.11 times
(significantly) more likely to present uveitis (OR 10.11, 95%
CI 1.13–90.77) than those treated with other drugs. Patients
treated with etanercept were also more likely to present AEs
such as generalised oedema (OR 8.59, 95% CI 0.12–621.46),
thyroid neoplasm malignant (OR 7.42, 95% CI 0.11–490.40),
sarcoidosis (OR 6.92, 95% CI 0.35–135.18), hyperkeratosis
(OR 5.08, 95% CI 0.13–193.08), acne (OR 3.33, 95% CI
0.18–61.66), and face oedema (OR 2.76, 95% CI 0.16–46.8)
than those treated with other drugs, but the difference was not
statistically significant (Table 4).

and infliximab increased dramatically in 2013 and 2015 due to
the introduction of biosimilars. An adalimumab biosimilar
was approved by the Korea Ministry of Food and Drug
Safety (MFDS) on Sep 24, 2013, and two adalimumab
biosimilars were approved by the Korea MFDS on Jul 20,
2012, and Dec 4, 2015, respectively. Owing to these concerns,
it is important to identify and evaluate safety signals of TNFα
inhibitors based on routine pharmacovigilance data. This
study used large-scale spontaneous AE reporting data spanning 12 years to detect safety signals accumulated from a
number of sources. In the case of biological drug-related AE
reports, hospital-based physicians are known to be the main
issuers of reports [27]. Similarly, healthcare providers, including physicians and pharmacists, were the main sources of AE
reports for all drugs in our study. Patients are another important source of AE report; they also contributed a substantial
portion of AE reports for adalimumab.
Treatment using TNFα inhibitors is relatively safe, but AEs
may occur acutely in response to the injection or infusion. In
clinical trials of adalimumab (Humira®), common AEs included injection site responses such as erythema, itching,

bleeding, pain, and swelling [27]. Our study confirmed that
the most common AEs were injection site reactions, including
pain and rash on the injection site for adalimumab; itching,
urticaria, rash, dyspnoea, and chest pain for infliximab; and
oscillation, itching, injection site reaction, and fever for
etanercept. These findings were consistent with those of a
previous study in Korea, where the most common adverse
reactions associated with TNFα inhibitors were cutaneous
reactions such as eczema, injection site reaction, and urticaria.
In comparison, studies conducted in other countries documented more serious AEs associated with TNFα inhibitors. In
the USA, the most frequent problems for using etanercept and
infliximab [28] are infections and one of the major risks of

using anti-TNF therapy is serious opportunistic infection [9].
In a Spanish study [29], the most frequent AEs in rheumatoid
arthritis were reactions after the infusion or injection and a
Portuguese study [12] showed that adalimumab, etanercept,
and infliximab were all disproportionately associated with infections and infestations and with neoplasms, compared to all
other drugs.
Using Korean data, we attempted to determine information
identifying a possible causal relationship between the use of
TNFα inhibitors and AEs, which would command regulatory,
societal, or clinical attention [30]. Using the spontaneous AE
reporting database and three different statistical methods, this
study identified seven new signals that are not listed in the

were medication error and medicine ineffectiveness for
adalimumab; palpitation and temperature sensation change
for infliximab; and hyperkeratosis, acne, and thyroid neoplasm malignant for etanercept. The differences observed in
pattern analysis and signal detection for adalimumab,

infliximab, and etanercept may be attributable to differences
in physiological processes or biologic pathways because they
are highly targeted molecules [28].
In addition, the safety profile of biologics may be influenced by their specific characteristics, such as a high potential
for immunogenicity. Medicine ineffectiveness, which was

included in spontaneous adverse reaction reports, is an insufficient or unexpected effect of a medicine, which can be
regarded as an adverse event of medication [31]. Our findings
suggest that these signals should be added to drug labels to
improve patient safety.
Our findings highlighted the importance of continuous surveillance and monitoring of adverse drug reactions. Timely
adjustment of drug labels based on new evidence of adverse
drug reactions can improve patient safety. However, full safety
profiles of drugs, including serious adverse drug events, do
not manifest until after many years of use. Therefore, methods
to identify signals have been devised in the USA [32, 33] and
Europe [34]. Moreover, findings from spontaneous reporting
data have led to drug label changes. A study using US Food
and Drug Administration data revealed that spontaneous reports contributed to 52% of safety-related drug label changes
in the USA [32]. These changes took place over 10 years after
approval, emphasising the importance of continued drug safety surveillance in signal detection and monitoring of safety
issues [34]. Palpitation, a detected signal in infliximab, was
not included in the US and Korean labels, but was included in
the drug label as an AE for infliximab in Europe [35]. In
contrast, abnormal hepatic function was not included in the
European drug label [35] for adalimumab, unlike in Korea and
the USA.
Most previous meta-analyses were not able to detect rare
events [36]. By using large-scale spontaneous AE reporting
data and data mining techniques, our findings discovered safety signals that may have a potential causal relationship with
the use of TNFα inhibitors. To the best of our knowledge, this
is the first pharmacovigilance study to detect safety signals
that used a spontaneous AE reporting database associated with
the use of TNFα inhibitors in Korea. A signal analysis in the
USA was conducted for infliximab based on spontaneous reports; however, it used only voluntary reports, which had lower data quality and a high probability of underreporting AEs,
thereby reducing the sensitivity for AE detection [9]. We
employed three different statistical methods to improve the
likelihood of detecting safety signals, which yielded some
conflicting results among the methods. For example, the three
new signals detected for etanercept (hyperkeratosis, acne, and
malignant thyroid neoplasm) met the criteria for IC but not for
PRR or ROR. This was probably because there was only one
report on these AEs. Nonetheless, these signals should be
considered for adjusting drug labels. Previously, IC has been
used to detect signals and change drug labels; sarcoidosis
detected by only IC was included in both the Korean and
US labels.
Despite these strengths, this study does have some limitations. First, although this study used spontaneous AE reports,
the actual occurrence rate of AEs associated with TNFα inhibitors might have been underestimated due to
underreporting. Another limitation is that statistical bias, such

354

Clin Rheumatol (2020) 39:347–355

as confounding factors in signal detection, was not adequately
controlled. Therefore, all detected signals could not be confirmed completely as adverse drug reactions caused by TNFα
inhibitors.
In conclusion, using the spontaneous AE reporting system,
this study identified seven new signals for TNFα inhibitors
(two for adalimumab, two for infliximab, and three for
etanercept) that are not listed on drug labels in Korea or the
USA. The current labelling information on adverse drug reactions for TNFα inhibitors may be insufficient to guide safe
drug therapy. Based on our findings, monitoring should be
continuous and the current drug labels for TNFα inhibitors
should be updated to reflect newly discovered signals associated with these drugs. Our findings further emphasise the importance of continuous pharmacovigilance and the updating
of drug labels based on spontaneous AE reporting data.
