Abstract
Objective: Adverse event reports (AERs) submitted to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) were reviewed to confirm platinum agent-associated adverse events, and to clarify
the rank-order of these drugs in terms of susceptibility.
Methods: After a revision of arbitrary drug names and the deletion of duplicated submissions, AERs involving cisplatin (CDDP), carboplatin (CBDCA), or oxaliplatin (L-OHP) were
analyzed. Authorized pharmacovigilance tools were used for the quantitative detection of
signals, i.e., drug-associated adverse events, including the proportional reporting ratio, the
reporting odds ratio, the information component given by a Bayesian confidence propagation
neural network, and the empirical Bayes geometric mean.
Results: Based on 1,644,220 AERs from 2004 to 2009, CDDP, CBDCA, and L-OHP all
proved to cause nausea, vomiting, acute renal failure, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and
peripheral sensory neuropathy. Higher susceptibility to nausea was found for CDDP than
CBDCA and L-OHP. Acute renal failure was also more predominant for CDDP, and CBDCA
did not increase the blood level of creatinine. A stronger association with thrombocytopenia
was suggested for CBDCA. Susceptibility to peripheral sensory neuropathy was greatest for
L-OHP, but less extensive for CDDP and CBDCA.
Conclusion: The results obtained herein were consistent with clinical observations, suggesting the usefulness of the FDA’s adverse event reporting system, AERS, and the data mining
method used herein.
Key words: adverse event, AERS, platinum agent, pharmacovigilance

Introduction
The chemotherapeutic treatment of solid tumors
has progressed extensively since the development of

the first platinum agent, cisplatin (CDDP), in the
1970s [1]. Although the precise mechanisms by which

http://www.medsci.org

Int. J. Med. Sci. 2011, 8
CDDP exerts its cytotoxic action has not been fully
elucidated, its effects on solid tumors have encouraged CDDP-based clinical protocols, and also the development of new platinum agents [1, 2]. Today, the
leading agents include CDDP, carboplatin (CBDCA),
and oxaliplatin (L-OHP), which share some structural
similarities, but differ in therapeutic use and safety
profiles.
Besides acute effects such as gastrointestinal
toxicity and myelosuppression, CDDP exerts its most
toxic effects on organs, such as the nervous system,
the organ of Corti, and the kidneys [2, 3]. The
dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) is nephrotoxicity, and
osmotic diuresis, a prolongation of infusion time, and
dose fractionation have been tried [2-4]. For CBDCA,
the DLT is myelosuppression, and the organ toxicity
is not as problematic, resulting in the replacement of
CDDP with CBDCA in CDDP-based protocols [2, 4].
L-OHP is not nephrotoxic like CBDCA, and only
moderately emetogenic, but peripheral sensory neuropathy is its most important toxic effect [2, 4-6].
Previously, adverse event reports (AERs) submitted to the US Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) were reviewed to confirm an association between platinum agents and hypersensitivity reactions
[7]. This database relies on spontaneous reports to the
FDA by health professionals, consumers, and manufacturers, and the system is referred to as the Adverse
Event Reporting System (AERS). To evaluate the results quantitatively, authorized pharmacovigilance
methods were used for signal detection [8-14], where
a signal means a drug-associated adverse event. Here,
gastrointestinal toxicity (nausea, vomiting), nephrotoxicity (acute renal failure, an increase in blood
creatinine level), myelosuppression (neutropenia,
thrombocytopenia) and peripheral sensory neuropathy are focused on as adverse events [1-6]. The
rank-order of CDDP, CBDCA, and L-OHP was clarified in terms of susceptibility to these adverse events
using statistical indices given by authorized pharmacovigilance methods [8-14].

Methods
Data sources
The data for this study were retrieved from the
public release of the FDA’s AERS database, which
covers the period from the first quarter of 2004
through the end of 2009. The data structure of AERS is
in compliance with international safety reporting
guidance, ICH E2B, consisting of 7 data sets; patient
demographic
and
administrative
information
(DEMO), drug/biologic information (DRUG), adverse
events (REAC), patient outcomes (OUTC), report

488
sources (RPSR), drug therapy start and end dates
(THER), and indications for use/diagnosis (INDI).
The adverse events in REAC are coded using preferred terms (PTs) in the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) terminology. Here, version 13.0 of MedDRA was used.
Prior to analysis, all drug names were unified
into generic names by a text-mining approach, because AERS permits the registering of arbitrary drug
names, including trade names and abbreviations. For
the batch conversion of drug names, reliable drug
databases, e.g., the FDA Orange Book, were utilized
as a dictionary. Spelling errors were detected by GNU
Aspell and carefully confirmed by working pharmacists. Furthermore, drug names which failed to receive
generic names were manually converted to proper
names. Foods, beverages, treatments (e.g. X-ray radiation), and unspecified names (e.g., beta-blockers)
were omitted for this study. Duplicated reports were
deleted according to FDA's recommendation of
adopting the most recent CASE number (as described
in one of the downloaded files, 'Asc_nts.doc' from the
web-site of the FDA AERS database), resulting in the
reduction of the number of AERs from 2,231,029 to
1,644,220.

Data mining
In pharmacovigilance analyses, data mining algorithms have been developed to
identify
drug-associated adverse events as signals that are
reported more frequently than expected by estimating
expected reporting frequencies on the basis of information on all drugs and all events in the database
[12-14]. The proportional reporting ratio (PRR) [8], the
reporting odds ratio (ROR) [9], the information component (IC) [10], and the empirical Bayes geometric
mean (EBGM) [11] are widely used, and indeed, are
currently employed by the Medicines and Healthcare
products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), UK, the
Netherlands Pharmacovigilance Centre, the World
Health Organization (WHO), and the FDA, respectively.
All of these algorithms extract decision rules for
signal detection and/or calculate scores to measure
the associations between drugs and adverse events
from a two-by-two frequency table of counts that involve the presence or absence of a particular drug and
a particular event occurring in case reports. These
algorithms, however, differ from one another in that
the PRR and ROR are frequentist (non-Bayesian),
whereas the IC and EBGM are Bayesian. In this section, only the scoring thresholds used in the present
study are given, and the reader is referred to review
articles for details [12-14].

For the PRR, a given drug-adverse event pair
was defined as a signal, if the event count was 3 or
more, and the PRR was 2 or more with an associated
chi-square value of 4 or more [8], and for the ROR, if
the lower limit of the 95% two-sided confidence interval (CI) of ROR exceeded 1 [9]. For the IC, IC025, a
criterion indicating the lower limit of the 95%
two-sided CI of the IC, was adopted, and an IC025
value exceeding 0 was defined as a signal [10]. Lastly,
for the EBGM, an EB05 of 2 or more was set as a
threshold for signal detection, where the EB05 is interpreted as the lower one-sided 95% confidence limit
of the EBGM [11]. In this study, AERs were extracted
for CDDP, CBDCA, and L-OHP, when the signal was
detected by either the PRR, ROR, IC or EBGM.

Results
In total, 884 adverse events were detected as
signals for CDDP, 810 for CBDCA, and 732 for
L-OHP. The total number was 28,382, 24,835, and
21,168, representing 0.13%, 0.11%, and 0.10% of all
co-occurrences, respectively.
Nausea/PT10028813,
vomiting/PT10047700,
acute
renal
failure/PT10038436,
neutropenia/PT10029354, thrombocytopenia/PT10043554,
and peripheral sensory neuropathy/PT10034620 were
detected for CDDP, CBDCA, and L-OHP. An increase
of blood creatinine level/PT10005483 was detected for
CDDP and L-OHP. The statistical data are listed in
Tables
1-4.
Diarrhea/PT10012735,
asthenia/PT10003549, dehydration/PT10012174, and py-

rexia/PT10037660 were also detected for all 3 platinum agents (data not shown).
Higher susceptibility to nausea was found for
CDDP than CBDCA and L-OHP, but L-OHP caused
vomiting equally to CDDP (Table 1). Acute renal
failure was also more predominant for CDDP, and no
CBDCA-associated increase in blood creatinine level
was detected (Table 2). The association with neutropenia was weaker for L-OHP than the others, and a
stronger association with thrombocytopenia was
suggested for CBDCA (Table 3). Susceptibility to peripheral sensory neuropathy was greatest for L-OHP,
but less extensive for CDDP and CBDCA (Table 4).

Discussion
The AERS database covers several million case
reports on adverse events. Pharmacovigilance aims to
search for previously unknown patterns and automatically
detect
important
signals,
i.e.,
drug-associated adverse events, from such a large
database. Recently developed data mining tools, i.e.,
the PRR, ROR, IC, and EBGM, have been successful at
detecting signals that could not be found by individual case reviews and that warrant further investigation together with continuous surveillance. These
tools are now used routinely for pharmacovigilance,
supporting signal detection and decision-making at
companies, regulatory agencies, and pharmacovigilance centers [8-14]. Comparisons of specificity have
showed that none of these indices is universally better
than the others [9, 12, 13], but EBGM has the lowest
sensitivity in this study (Tables 1-4).

The AERS database is considered a valuable tool;
however, some limitations inherent to spontaneous
reporting have been pointed out [12]. First, the data
occasionally contain misspelling and miswords, although the structure of AERS is in compliance with the
international safety reporting guidance. Second, the
system was started more than 10 years ago, and reporting patterns have changed over time. Third, the
adverse events are coded using hierarchical terms of
PTs of MedDRA, and changes in terminology over
time also might affect the quality of the database. Last,
there are a number of duplicate entries in the database. To overcome problems with data quality, we
manually corrected mistakes in the data entities and
deleted duplicates according to FDA’s recommended
method. What’s an urgent need is to verify the usefulness of system we developed by comparing the
data obtained and clinical observations, and here, the
platinum agent-associated adverse events were analyzed.
CBDCA is thought to be only moderately
emetogenic like L-OHP, when compared with CDDP
[2]. This clinical observation was demonstrated quantitatively herein; a higher susceptibility to nausea was
found for CDDP (Table 1). However, it is strange that
L-OHP caused vomiting equally to CDDP, and they
might differ in the combination of antiemetic drugs.
The DLT of CDDP is nephrotoxicity, which is said to
be less common or absent in patients receiving
CBDCA or L-OHP [2]. This was also proved here
(Table 2). The DLT of CBDCA is myelosuppression,
and a stronger association with thrombocytopenia
was suggested for CBDCA (Table 3). The most important adverse event of L-OHP is peripheral sensory
neuropathy [2], and again this was confirmed in the
present study (Table 4). Collectively, the quantitative
data obtained herein were consistent with clinical
observations, suggesting the usefulness of the AERS
database and data mining method, although further
extensive examinations should be performed.
In conclusion, AERs submitted to the FDA were
reviewed to confirm platinum agent-associated adverse events and to clarify rank-order in terms of
susceptibility. Based on 1,644,220 AERs from 2004 to
2009, it was confirmed that CDDP, CBDCA and
L-OHP proved to cause nausea, vomiting, acute renal
failure, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and peripheral sensory neuropathy. The rank-order was consistent with clinical observations, suggesting the usefulness of the AERS database and the data mining
method used herein.
