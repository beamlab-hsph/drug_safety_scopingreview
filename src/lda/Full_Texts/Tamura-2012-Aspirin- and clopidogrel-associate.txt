Abstract
Objective: Adverse event reports (AERs) submitted to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) were reviewed to assess the bleeding complications induced by the administration
of antiplatelets and to attempt to determine the rank-order of the association.
Methods: After a deletion of duplicated submissions and the revision of arbitrary drug
names, AERs involving warfarin, aspirin, cilostazol, clopidogrel, ethyl icosapentate, limaprost
alfadex, sarpogrelate, and ticlopidine were analyzed. Authorized pharmacovigilance tools
were used for the quantitative detection of signals, i.e., drug-associated adverse events, including the proportional reporting ratio, the reporting odds ratio, the information component
given by a Bayesian confidence propagation neural network, and the empirical Bayes geometric mean.
Results: Based on 22,017,956 co-occurrences, i.e., drug-adverse event pairs, found in
1,644,220 AERs from 2004 to 2009, 736 adverse events were listed as warfarin-associated
adverse events, and 147 of the 736 were bleeding complications, including haemorrhage and
haematoma. Both aspirin and clopidogrel were associated with haemorrhage, but the association was more noteworthy for clopidogrel. As for bleeding complications related to the
gastrointestinal system, e.g., melaena and haematochezia, the statistical metrics suggested a
stronger association for aspirin than clopidogrel. The total number of co-occurrences was not
large enough to compare the association with bleeding complications for the other 5 antiplatelets.
Conclusions: The data strongly suggest the necessity of well-organized clinical studies with
respect to antiplatelet-associated bleeding complications.
Key words: adverse events, AERS, warfarin, antiplatelets, pharmacovigilance.

Introduction
Arterial platelet-rich thrombosis differs from
venous fibrin-rich thrombosis in terms of pathogenesis and prevention strategy, but both have considera-

ble medical impact [1, 2]. Myocardial infarction or
stroke is often caused by arterial thrombosis, and venous thrombosis accounts for considerable mortality
http://www.medsci.org

Int. J. Med. Sci. 2012, 9
from cardiovascular events [1, 2]. Antiplatelets are the
basis for prevention of arterial thrombosis, whereas
anticoagulants are effective for venous thrombosis;
however, recent molecular investigations suggest the
interdependence of platelets and the coagulation system in both forms of thrombosis [2], and physicians
often recommend their combinations especially in
patients with atrial fibrillation [3].
Currently, a myriad of patients are receiving
combined warfarin-aspirin therapy to prevent
thrombosis, but there is little clinical evidence of a
therapeutic benefit compared with either alone, except for patients with acute coronary syndrome and
mechanical heart valves [3-5]. The combination of
warfarin and aspirin is more effective than aspirin
alone for the prevention of recurrent cardiovascular
events in patients with acute coronary syndrome [6, 7]
and is more effective than warfarin alone for the prevention of thromboembolic events in patients with
mechanical heart valves [8, 9]. On the other hand,
there is compelling evidence that the warfarin-aspirin
combination results in an increase in risk for serious
bleeding complications [6-12]. Collectively, we should
contemplate the risk-benefit balance of this combination, especially when data from randomized controlled trials are lacking [3-5].
Most reports on bleeding complications caused
by anticoagulants and/or antiplatelets are of warfarin
and/or aspirin, with little information available for
other antiplatelets, e.g., cilostazol, clopidogrel, ethyl
icosapentate, limaprost alfadex, sarpogrelate and
ticlopidine This study was conducted to assess the
bleeding complications induced by the administration
of antiplatelets and to attempt to determine the
rank-order of the association, using more than a million case reports on adverse events (AERs) submitted
to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Authorized pharmacovigilance methods were used for
quantitative signal detection [13-19], where a signal
means a drug-associated adverse event or an association between a drug and an adverse event. Here, 7
antiplatelets were compared with warfarin in terms of
susceptibility to bleeding complications.

Methods
Data sources
Input data for this study were taken from the
public release of the FDA’s Adverse Event Reporting
System (AERS) database, which covers the period
from the first quarter of 2004 through the end of 2009.
The total number of reports used was 2,231,029. This
database relies on reports of spontaneous adverse
events by health professionals, consumers, and man-

442
ufacturers. The data structure of AERS is in compliance with international safety reporting guidance,
ICH E2B, consisting of 7 data sets; patient demographic and administrative information (DEMO),
drug/biologic information (DRUG), adverse events
(REAC), patient outcomes (OUTC), report sources
(RPSR), drug therapy start and end dates (THER), and
indications for use/diagnosis (INDI). The adverse
events in REAC are coded using preferred terms (PTs)
in the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities
(MedDRA) terminology. Here, version 13.0 of
MedDRA was used.
Prior to analysis, duplicated reports were deleted according to the FDA's recommendation of
adopting the most recent CASE number, resulting in a
reduction in the number of reports from 2,231,029 to
1,644,220. All drug names were unified into generic
names by a text-mining approach, because AERS
permits the registering of arbitrary drug names, including trade names and abbreviations. Spelling errors were detected by a spell checker software, GNU
Aspell, and carefully confirmed by working pharmacists. The total number of errors was 223,239. Foods,
beverages, treatments (e.g. X-ray radiation), and unspecified names (e.g. beta-blockers) were omitted for
this study, and the total number of omissions was
164,384. A total of 22,017,956 co-occurrences were
found in 1,644,220 reports, where a co-occurrence was
a pair of a drug and an adverse drug event.

Definition of bleeding complications
The Standard MedDRA Queries (SMQs) are
groupings of PT terms, which relate to defined medical conditions or areas of interest. A total of 82 SMQs
have been released by the MedDRA maintenance and
support
services
organization
(http://www.
meddramsso.com/). The heamorrhage SMQ consists
of 421 PT terms; 91 heamorrhage laboratory PT terms
(e.g., PT10022595: international normalised ratio
(INR) increased, PT10022592: INR abnormal) and 330
heamorrhage PT terms (e.g., PT10055798: heamorrhage, PT10018852: haematoma). Here, 421 PT terms
found in the heamorrhage SMQ were defined as
bleeding complications.

Aspirin as antiplatelets
Aspirin is indicated for prevention of arterial
thrombosis, but is also used to treat mild to moderate
pain, fever and inflammatory diseases. Inclusion criteria for analysis included 1) “bayaspirin”, “baby aspirin” or “children aspirin” for drug name, 2) term
“low dose” in drug name, 3) PT terms located within a
system organ class (SOC) of cardiac disorders
(SOC10007541) or vascular disorders (SOC10047065),
http://www.medsci.org

Int. J. Med. Sci. 2012, 9
4) PT terms located within a high level group term
(HLGT) of vascular therapeutic procedures
(HLGT10003184), 5) terms “stroke”, “infarction”,
“thrombosis”, “ischemia”, “attack”, “artery”, “vascular” or “sclerosis” in PT terms, and 6) daily dose of
325mg or less.

Data mining
In pharmacovigilance analyses, data mining algorithms have been developed to
identify
drug-associated adverse events as signals that are
reported more frequently than expected by estimating
expected reporting frequencies on the basis of information on all drugs and all events in the database
[17-19]. For example, the proportional reporting ratio
(PRR) [13], the reporting odds ratio (ROR) [14], the
information component (IC) [15], and the empirical
Bayes geometric mean (EBGM) [16] are widely used,
and indeed, the PRR is currently employed by the
Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory
Agency (MHRA), UK, the ROR by the Netherlands
Pharmacovigilance Centre, the IC by the World
Health Organization (WHO), and the EBGM by the
FDA.
All of these algorithms extract decision rules for
signal detection and/or calculate scores to measure
the associations between drugs and adverse events
from a two-by-two frequency table of counts that involve the presence or absence of a particular drug and
a particular event occurring in case reports. These
algorithms, however, differ from one another in that
the PRR and ROR are frequentist (non-Bayesian),
whereas the IC and EBGM are Bayesian. In this section, only the scoring thresholds used in the present
study are given, and the reader is referred to review
articles for more extensive details of each statistical
test [17-19].
Here, we define how a drug and associated adverse event is classified as a signal when using each
statistical test. Using the PRR, a signal is detected if
the count of co-occurrences is 3 or more and the PRR
is 2 or more with an associated χ2 value of 4 or more
[13]. For the ROR, a signal is detected, if the lower
bound of the 95% two-sided confidence interval exceeds 1 [14]. Signal detection using the IC is done using the IC025 metric, a criterion indicating the lower
bound of the 95% two-sided confidence interval of the
IC, and a signal is detected if the IC025 value exceeds
0 [15]. Finally, the EB05 metric, a lower one-sided 95%
confidence limit of EBGM, is used and a signal is detected when EB05 is greater than or equal to the
threshold value 2.0 [16]. In this study, the adverse
events were listed as drug-associated, when at least 1
of 4 indices met the criteria indicated above.

Results
Table 1 lists the total number of co-occurrences,
and the number of adverse events listed as
drug-associated adverse events with co-occurrences.
The total number of co-occurrences with warfarin was
156,357, and 59,855 for aspirin and 121,166 for
clopidogrel, representing 0.710%, 0.272% and 0.550%
of all co-occurrences in the database, respectively. In
total, 736, 848 and 838 adverse events were listed as
drug-associated adverse events with 64,289, 24,536,
and 55,079 co-occurrences, respectively. The total
number of co-occurrences was not large enough to
compare the association with adverse events for cilostazol, ethyl icosapentate, limaprost alfadex, sarpogrelate and ticlopidine.
Of 736 warfarin-associated adverse events, 147
were bleeding complications, the worst 20 being listed
in Table 2. Based on the number of co-occurrences, the
worst is an increase of INR, followed by heamorrhage,
gastrointestinal heamorrhage, epistaxis, and a prolongation of prothrombin time in this order. Aspirin
was also associated with these bleeding complications
with exception of an abnormal INR. In the case of
clopidogrel, exceptions included an increase of INR, a
prolongation of prothrombin time, an abnormal INR
and a prolongation of activated partial thromboplastin time (statistical data not shown).
Table 3 lists the statistical data on the association
of warfarin, aspirin, and clopidogrel with heamorrhage and haematoma. The association with
heamorrhage was more noteworthy for clopidogrel
than aspirin, but the signals were weaker than for
warfarin. A stronger signal for clopidogrel than aspirin was also observed for contusion (statistical data
not shown).
Table 4 lists the data on melaena and haematochezia. The statistical metrics suggested a stronger
association for aspirin than clopidogrel. This order
was also found for gastrointestinal haemorrhage, a
decrease of haematocrit value, cerebral haemorrhage,
rectal haemorrhage, haemoptysis, subdural haematoma, haematemesis and gastric haemorrhage (statistical data not shown).

Discussion
The AERS database is considered a valuable
tool; however, some limitations inherent to spontaneous reporting have been pointed out [17]. First, the
data occasionally contain misspelling and miswords,
although the structure of AERS is in compliance with
the international safety reporting guidance. Second,
the system was started more than 10 years ago, and
reporting patterns have changed over time. Third, the

http://www.medsci.org

Int. J. Med. Sci. 2012, 9

444

adverse events are coded using hierarchical terms of
PTs of MedDRA, and changes in terminology over
time also might affect the quality of the database. Last,
there are a number of duplicate entries in the database. To overcome problems with data quality, we
manually corrected mistakes in the data entities and
deleted duplicates according to the FDA’s recommended method. Previously, this system has been

used to assess adverse events accompanying the use
of platinum agents [20], statins [21], 5-fluorouracil and
capecitabine [22], tigecycline [23] and omeprazole and
esomeprazole [24], and anticancer agent-associated
hypersensitivity reactions [25, 26]. The reproducibility
of clinical observations was suggested, but the number of co-occurrences should be large enough to detect
a signal.

In this study, a total of 736 adverse events were
listed as warfarin-associated adverse events, and 147
of the 736 were bleeding complications. In 2007,
Wysowski et al. reported the worst 30 ranking adverse events with use of warfarin using the AERS
database from January 1993 to July 2006 [27]. Based on
the number of reports, the adverse events ranked at a
relatively high position included an increase of INR,
drug interaction, gastrointestinal haemorrhage,
haemorrhage, haematuria, anaemia, epistaxis, and
melaena [27]. These adverse events also ranked at a
higher position in this study, although the ranking
was based on the number of occurrences and those
without signals detected were excluded.
Both aspirin and clopidogrel were also associated with bleeding complications. The association
with haemorrhage was more noteworthy for
clopidogrel than aspirin; however, for gastrointestinal

bleeding complications, the statistical metrics suggested a stronger association for aspirin than
clopidogrel. Recently, Hausen et al. reported the
bleeding risk in patients with atrial fibrillation, treated
with warfarin, aspirin, clopidogrel, and combinations
thereof [10]. They performed a cohort study using the
data in the Danish National Patient Registry, a system
started in1978, and employed the Cox model to estimate the risk of bleeding. Using warfarin monotherapy as a reference, the hazard ratio (95% confidential
interval) for fatal bleeding was 1.37 (1.13-1.65) and
2.22 (1.30-3.77) for aspirin and clopidogrel monotherapy, respectively, but for gastrointestinal bleeding, it was 1.28 (1.17-1.41) and 1.18 (0.84-1.67), respectively. The data obtained in the present study does not
conflict with the report by Hausen et al.
The incidence of bleeding with use of warfarin
was variable among the clinical reports, and the varihttp://www.medsci.org

Int. J. Med. Sci. 2012, 9
ation might be explained by many factors, including
definition of bleeding, patient mixes with indications
and risks of bleeding, targeted INR, treatment protocol, treatment setting and length of follow-up [27].
The ARES database has an advantage in the use of
well-organized authorized terms of MedDRA, although the incidence cannot be calculated in this
analysis. Additionally, it should be noted that there is
no credible counterfactual means, e.g., a randomized
control group, to extract drug-associated adverse
events as signals, and therefore disease-oriented adverse events can be listed as signals. The results can be
biased by unmeasured confounding factors. Although
the comparison of aspirin with clopidogrel possibly
offsets them, a statistically well-organized methodology should be established to minimize their effects.
In conclusion, the data strongly suggest the necessity
of well-organized clinical studies with respect to antiplatelet-associated bleeding complications.
