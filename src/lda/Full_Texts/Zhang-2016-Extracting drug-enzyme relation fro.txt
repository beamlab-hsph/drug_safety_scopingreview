Extracting drug-enzyme relation from
literature as evidence for drug drug
interaction
Yaoyun Zhang1, Heng-Yi Wu2, Jingcheng Du1, Jun Xu1, Jingqi Wang1, Cui Tao1, Lang Li2 and Hua Xu1*

Abstract
Background: Information about drug–drug interactions (DDIs) is crucial for computational applications such as
pharmacovigilance and drug repurposing. However, existing sources of DDIs have the problems of low coverage,
low accuracy and low agreement. One common type of DDIs is related to the mechanism of drug metabolism: a
DDI relation may be caused by different interactions (e.g., substrate, inhibit) between drugs and enzymes in the
drug metabolism process. Thus, information from drug enzyme interactions (DEIs) serves as important supportive
evidence for DDIs. Further, potential DDIs present implicitly could be detected by inference and reasoning based
on DEIs.
Methods: In this article, we propose a hybrid approach to combining machine learning algorithm with trigger
words and syntactic patterns, for DEI relation extraction from biomedical literature. The extracted DEI relations
are used for reasoning to infer potential DDI relations, based on a defined drug-enzyme ontology incorporating
biological knowledge.
Results: Evaluation results demonstrate that the performance of DEI relation extraction is promising, with an F-measure
of 84.97 % on the in vivo dataset and 65.58 % on the in vitro dataset. Further, the inferred DDIs achieved a precision of
83.19 % on the in vivo dataset and 70.94 % on the in vitro dataset, respectively. A further examination showed that the
overlaps between our inferred DDIs and those present in DrugBank were 42.02 % on the in vivo dataset and 19.23 % on
the in vitro dataset, respectively.
Conclusions: This paper proposed an effective approach to extract DEI relations from biomedical literature. Potential
DDIs not present in existing knowledge bases were then inferred based on the extracted DEIs, demonstrating
the capability of the proposed approach to detect DDIs with scientific evidence for pharmacovigilance and
drug repurposing applications.

Background
Drug–drug interaction (DDI) is a situation when one
drug alters the effect of another drug in a clinically
meaningful way [1]. It has been demonstrated as one
of the major causes of adverse drug reactions and a
threat to public health [2–4]. Existing resources of
DDIs include expert-curated knowledge bases such as

DiDB (http://www.druginteractioninfo.org/), DrugBank
(http:// www.drugbank.ca/), and pharmacy clinical support systems [5]. Significant efforts have been invested to
incorporate DDIs into various data sources. However,
existing sources suffer from the problems of low coverage
[6], low accuracy [7] and low agreement [8].
Under such circumstance, scientific evidence revealing
the mechanism behind the drug interactions are necessary to provide support for reliable DDI information [9].
One common type of DDIs is related to the mechanism
of drug metabolism. For example, suppose drug A is a

substrate of enzyme E, i.e., enzyme E is responsible for
the metabolism of drug A. If the enzyme is inhibited or
induced by drug B, the metabolism process of the drug
A may be affected. Thus, the bioavailability of drug A
could be different than expected, potentially causing
adverse effect [10]. Therefore, drug-enzyme interactions
(DEIs) serve as one type of important supportive evidence for DDIs. Besides, DDIs not explicitly stated in
text may be detected by linking and reasoning over DEIs
published in different scientific articles.
Since newly reported DEIs are rapidly accumulating in
the huge archive of scientific literature [11], text mining
techniques are needed to automatically extract DEIs as
supportive scientific evidence for DDIs [6]. One pilot
work in this direction is [10], which tried to extract the
relations between drugs and enzymes based on properties of drug metabolism; potential DDIs were then
detected by inference and reasoning. In [10], sentences
in PubMed were stored as parse trees in a database, and
SQL queries consisting of keywords and simple syntactic
and semantic constraints were used to extract DEIs.
SemRep [12], a widely used tool to extract relations from
biomedical literature, also uses rule-based methods to
extract DEI relations.
One problem with current DEI extraction methods is
that their performance tend to be poor [10], given that
sentences in scientific literature tend to be long and have
complex structure. Hence, more data-driven, statistical
methods such as machine learning algorithms are necessary to automatically improve the performance. Furthermore, no biological knowledge of concept hierarchies is
involved in the inference process for DDIs currently. For
example, if the drug Delavirdine is an inhibitor of
CYP3A [13], it could be an inhibitor of all enzymes in
the subfamily of CYP3A, such as CYP3A4. Potential
DDIs between Delavirdine and drugs that are substrates
of CYP3A4 could then be inferred. In this way, more
implicit potential DDIs may be identified.
In this article, we propose a hybrid approach to
extracting DEI relations. First, related drug enzyme pairs
are extracted from sentences using the all-path graph
kernel based machine-learning algorithm [14]. Specific
DEI relation types are then assigned according to trigger
words and syntactic patterns. After that, variations of
drug and enzyme names are normalized to remove redundant relations. In the last step, inference rules are
built based on the drug-enzyme ontology and biological
knowledge about mechanisms of drug metabolism and
interaction. Using these inference rules, the extracted
DEI relations are then used for reasoning and inferring
potential DDI relations.
Our approach differs from existing approaches in
two ways. First, we propose a hybrid method to improve the performance of DEI relation extraction.

Second, we establish an ontology-based inference process,
incorporating hierarchical relations between enzymes.
Our evaluation results using the DEI corpus [15] demonstrates that our proposed approach outperforms SemRep
significantly. Moreover, implicit DDI relations are inferred
with supportive evidence from DEIs, which may contribute to existing DDI knowledge bases such as DrugBank.

Methods
Two DEI datasets, consisting of in vivo studies and in
vitro studies, were used in this study. Our method
involves three steps. First, related drug-enzyme pairs
were extracted using an all-path graph kernel based
machine-learning model. Different relation types were
then assigned based on the trigger words and syntactic
patterns. Second, variations of drug and enzyme names
were normalized to remove redundant relations. In the
last step, inference rules were built on the basis of
drug-enzyme ontology and biological knowledge about
mechanisms of drug metabolism and interaction.
Using these inference rules, the extracted DEI relations
were used for reasoning about potential DDI relations.
Datasets

The corpus of DEI relations built by Wu, Karnik et al.
[15] was employed in this study. The DEI relations were
manually curated using 428 related abstracts from MedLine [15]. Related abstracts were retrieved from MedLine
using the keywords of probe substrate/inhibitor/inducers
for specific metabolism enzymes in queries. The abstracts
for annotation were randomly selected from the search
results. The abstracts in this corpus were categorized into
two datasets for in vivo studies and in vitro studies,
respectively, in order to accommodate the differences
found between them the two study types. Two example
sentences with DEI relations from the in vivo and in vitro
studies are listed in Table 1.
All the drug enzyme pairs that co-occur in one sentence were considered as candidate DEI pairs. The
interaction relations between drug pairs were labeled
as “DEI” (positive) or “NDEI” (negative). Table 2 shows
the statistics from the two datasets.

Relation extraction

Our relation extraction method consisted of three
steps. First, we represented sentences with dependencybased syntactic structures. Second, all-path graph kernels describing the syntactic connections within the
sentences were generated from those representations. A
Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier was trained
based on the graph kernels to generate a predictive
model and to identify if the candidate drug-enzyme pair
was related. In the last step, trigger words and syntactic
patterns of different mechanisms of metabolism, i.e.,
“substrate”, “inhibitor”, “inducer”, were used for specific
DEI relation assignment.

S1: CYP2C9 exhibited substantial sildenafil Ndemethylase activity.
Dependency graph of a sentence was constructed
based on its syntactic parse structure. It was a directed
graph that included two types of vertices: a word vertex
containing its lemma and part-of-speech tags (POS), and
a dependency vertex containing the dependency relation
between words. In addition, both types of vertices contained their positions, which differentiated them from
other vertices. Figure 1(a) illustrates the dependency
graph of S1. Since the words connecting the candidate
entities in a syntactic representation are particularly
likely to carry information regarding their relationship
[16], the labels of the vertexes on the shortest undirected
paths connecting “drug” and “enzyme” were differentiated from the labels outside the paths using a special tag
“IP”. Further, the edges were assigned weights; all edges
on the shortest paths received a weight of 0.9 and other
edges received a weight of 0.3 as in [14]. Thus, the shortest path is emphasized while also considering the other
words outside the path as potentially relevant.
All-path graph kernel

Sentence representation

Sentences with candidate DEI pairs were represented by
the dependency syntactic structure. For generalization,
specific drug/enzyme names in a candidate DEI pair
were replaced with “Drug”/“Enzyme” in a preprocessing
step. For example, CYP2C9 and sildenafil in S1 were
replaced with Enzyme1 and Drug1.
Enzyme1
Drug1

A graph kernel calculates the similarity between two
input graphs by comparing the relations between common vertices. The weights of the relations are calculated
using all possible paths between each pair of vertices.
Our method follows the all-paths graph kernel proposed
by Airola et al. [14]. The kernel represented the target
pair using graph matrices based on two sub-graphs. The
first sub-graph represented the structure of a sentence
using the dependency graph; the second sub-graph

the enzyme and the drug is shown in bold. In the dependency based sub-graph (a), all nodes in the shortest path are specialized using a post-tag (IP).

represented the word sequence in the sentence, and each
of its word vertices contained its lemma, its relative position to the target pair and its POS; all edges received a
weight of 0.9 as in [14] (please see Fig. 1(b)).
Assuming that V represents the set of vertices in the
graph, calculation of the similarity between two graphs
used two types of matrices: edge adjacent matrix A and
label matrix L. The graph is represented with the adjacent matrix A ∈ R|V| × |V| whose rows and columns were
indexed by the vertices, and [A]i,j contains the weight of
the edge connecting vi ∈ V and vj ∈ V if such an edge
exists, and 0 otherwise. In addition, the labels were presented as a label allocation matrix L ∈ R|I| × |V|, so that
Li,j = 1 if the j-th vertex had the i-th label, and Li,j = 0
otherwise. Using the Neumann Series, a graph matrix G
is calculated as:
G ¼ LT

This matrix sums up the weights of all the paths between any pair of vertices, where each entry represents
the strength of the relation between a pair of vertices.
Given two instances of graph matrices G′ and G″, the
graph kernel K(G', G' ') is defined as follows:

Relation type assignment

After recognizing the related drug-enzyme pairs, the rules
generated from trigger words and common syntactic patterns of various mechanisms of drug metabolism were
used to assign specific relations, i.e., “isSubstrateOf”, “isInhibitorOf” and “isInducerOf”. Some rules of each relation
are illustrated in Table 3. For example, the sentence “The
metabolism of MDZ, which is specifically metabolized by
CYP3A4 in humans” matches the pattern of “Drug… metabolized by Enzyme”, from which the relation that MDZ
is a substrate of CYP3A4 could be identified. The source
code for relation assignment rules can be accessed following the link https://sbmi.uth.edu/ccb/resources/dei.htm.

Concept normalization

In the DEI datasets employed in this study, the drug
names were recognized using DrugBank and regular expressions of various drug metabolites; enzyme names
were recognized using regular expressions of various
forms of enzymes [15]. Many variations of drugs and enzymes were annotated in the dataset. For example,
“CBZ” is an abbreviation of the drug “Carbamazepine”.
Both “P4503A4” and “3A4” were mentions of the enzyme “CYP3A4”. Hence, drug names and enzyme names
were first normalized to reduce relation redundancy
before the reasoning step. Drug names were normalized to concepts in Unified Medical Language System
(UMLS) [17] using MetaMap [18]. Enzyme names
were normalized to CYP450 enzymes, as defined in the
human cytochrome P450 allele nomenclature database,
http://www.cypalleles.ki.se/. The number of extracted
DEIs were reduced accordingly.
Knowledge representation and reasoning
Drug-enzyme ontology definition

To incorporate the knowledge of drug metabolism with
the extracted DEI relations from biological literature, we
created a DEI ontology. There are two classes in DEI
ontology: Drug and Enzyme. Each extracted drug or
enzyme was considered an individual of Drug or Enzyme
respectively. Further, biological knowledge of mechanisms in drug metabolism were represented by object
properties between Drug and Enzyme in the ontology.
As shown in Table 4, five object properties were defined
between Drug and Enzyme. We implemented the DEI
ontology in OWL 2 (Web Ontology Language) [19].
OWL 2 uses description logic to represent formal semantics for semantic inference. OWL API (Application
Programming Interface) was used for the creation and
manipulation of the DEI Ontology [20].
Drug enzyme ontology based inference

After the ontology was populated, we defined property
chain rules to infer new DDI. The following are three
rules that we defined to infer DDI:

DDI (d1, d2)
Rule 3: isSubstrateOf (d1, e1) and isAncestorOf (e1, e2)
- > isSubstrateOf (d1, e2)
Rule 1 and Rule 2 encode the knowledge that if a given
drug d1 is a substrate of enzyme e, and drug d2 is an
inhibitor/inducer of enzyme e, then drug d1 and d2 have
a potential interaction. Rule 3 defines that the isSubstrateOf relation can be inherited by a descendant enzyme
from its ancestors. Similar rules of inheritance were
then defined for the other drug-enzyme relations based
on the enzyme hierarchical relations. The reasoner
HermiT was employed for DDI relation inference,
which could check consistency of ontologies, compute
the classification hierarchy, and explain inferences
(Horrocks, et al., 2012). The ontology can be downloaded

relation extraction [14, 23]. Different kernel options
and parameters provided by JSRE were examined by
10-fold cross validation on the training datasets. The
optimal performance of JSRE was used for comparison
in our study, which was achieved by employing
the shallow linguistic context kernel with default
parameters. Further comparison was made with
the existing knowledge base SemMedDB of literature
relations, which was built using the SemRep system
[12]. To select relations between drugs and genes
from SemMedDB, PMIDs were used as one of the
query constraints, to ensure that the selected relations
were within the same publications as the test datasets.
(2)Comparison of generated DDI relations with
DrugBank: for each drug, we looked into the
overlap between the generated DDI relations with
the DrugBank. Specfically, novel DDI relations
generated in our study were examined by checking
their supportive evidence.

Results and discussion
Experiments
Machine learning (ML) algorithm

SVM algorithms are the dominant ML methods (SeguraBedmar et al., 2013) among the existing DDI systems.
This study used the sparse version of RLS, also known
as the least squares SVM, to learn the DEI prediction
model based on the all-path graph kernel [14].
Experimental setup

POS-tags and dependency trees of the datasets were
generated by Stanford parser [21]. We used the standard
evaluation measures (Precision, Recall and F- measure)
to evaluate the performance. We evaluated the performance of our system on each test dataset after training on
the corresponding training dataset. Because our datasets
were imbalanced with much more ‘NDEI’ relations then
“DEI” relations, the same candidate drug-enzyme pair
present in multiple instances may be classified as ‘DEI’
in one instance and as ‘NDEI’ in another. In this case,
we treated this candidate DEI pair as a true ‘DEI’ pair to
enhance the precision. Hence, the performance evaluation of relation extraction was carried out at the entitylevel instead of the sentence level.
The following systematic analyses were conducted
based on the experiments implemented in our study:
(1)Comparison of DEI relation extraction performance
between the all-path graph kernel based model
(GraphKernel) with the model of java simple relation
extraction (JSRE) [22]. JSRE is another state-of-theart relation extraction model. It has demonstrated
comparable performance with the all-path graph
kernel based model in protein-protein interaction

Performance of drug-enzyme relation extraction

Table 5 illustrates the performance of DEI relation extraction. As can be seen, JSRE obtained higher recall on both
datasets as compared to the GraphKernel (in vivo: 83.67 %
vs. 85.30 %; in vitro: 57.96 % vs. 71.20 %), while its precision
dropped significantly (in vivo: 86.32 % vs. 72.70 %; in vitro:
75.51 % vs. 61.90 %). Overall, GraphKernel outperformed
JSRE on the in vivo dataset (F1: 84.97 % vs. 78.50 %), with a
slightly lower F1 on the in vitro dataset (F1: 65.58 % vs.
66.20 %). The DEI relations extracted by SemRep are of
only two types (‘INTERACTS_WITH’ and ‘INHIBITS’),
most of which were of the ‘INTERACTS_WITH’ type
(105/165). Therefore, only the performance with reference
to recognition of related drug-enzyme pairs was compared
between our method and SemRep. As shown in Table 5,
GraphKernel outperformed SemRep significantly (in vivo:
84.97 % vs. 30.53 %; in vitro: 65.58 % vs. 15.32 %). Besides,
the performance of the in vivo study dataset was much
higher than that of the in vitro study dataset. Specifically,
in the in vitro study dataset, the recall was much lower as
compared to the in vivo study dataset (GraphKernel:
84.97 % vs. 65.58 %; SemRep: 30.53 % vs. 15.32 %).

Table 6 illustrates the performance of our system in
terms of drug-enzyme relation assignment. After drug
and enzyme normalizations, 30 isSubstrateOf, 29 isInhibitorOf and 7 isInducerOf relations were identified in the
in vivo dataset totally; 62 isSubstrateOf, 67 isInhibitorOf
and 5 isInducerOf relations were identified in the in vitro
dataset. As can be seen, the performance for the isSubstrateOf relation was relatively higher among the three
relations in both datasets (in vivo: 87.48 %; in vitro:
72.79 %). The performance in the in vitro dataset is
much lower than that in the in vivo dataset, since many
of DEI pairs were already lost in the first stage of recognizing related drug-enzyme pairs (Table 5). The extracted relations were used to populate the DEI ontology
defined in Section 2.4.1. Totally, the current ontology
contains 104 individuals in Drug, 16 individuals in Enzyme, and 213 triples for drug metabolism, including 81
isSubstrateOf triples, 96 isInhibitorOf triples, 12 isInducerOf triples, and 24 isAncestorOf triples.
Performance of drug-drug interaction inference

Evaluation results of inferred DDIs are listed in Table 7.
Totally, 181 DDIs were inferred from the in vivo dataset,
and 376 DDIs were inferred from the in vitro dataset, respectively. For comparison, only relations between drugs
present in DrugBank were examined during evaluation.
Totally, 31 drugs and 40 drugs in the in vivo and in vitro
datasets, were present in DrugBank respectively. For the
drugs present both in our corpus and DrugBank, totally
119 DDIs were inferred from the in vivo dataset, of
which 69 DDIs were not included in DrugBank; 234
DDIs were inferred from the in vivo dataset, of which189
DDIs were not included in DrugBank. As illustrated in
Table 7, the overlap between inferred DDIs in this study
and DrugBank was low (in vivo: 42.02 %; in vitro:
19.23 %). However, by manually checking the supportive
evidences, i.e., the underlying DEI relations for those
DDIs, it was verified that the inferred DDIs achieved a
precision of 83.19 % for the in vivo dataset and 70.94 %
for the in vitro dataset, respectively.
Discussion

DEIs are important supportive evidence for DDIs. This
study applied a hybrid approach for DEI relation extraction

from biomedical literature. Reasoning was then conducted
on the extracted DEIs to infer potential DDI relations, by
incorporating biological knowledge into drug-enzyme
ontology. Evaluation results demonstrated the effectiveness
of our approach: potential DDIs were inferred with reliable
precisions (in vivo: 80.30 %; in vitro: 72.09 %), indicating its
capability to detect DDIs with scientific evidence.
The model of GraphKernel obtained much higher precision and lower recall than JSRE (Table 5). This demonstrated that GraphKernel and JSRE have advantages of
different aspects on the DEI datasets. One potential
explanation could be the essential kernel difference between these two models. JSRE only relies on shallow
linguistic features of text, such as tokens, POS and lemmas, while GraphKernel combines shallow linguistic
features with more complex structural syntactic features.
Thus, the constraints of JSRE were relatively relaxed
on the text in comparison with GraphKernel, leading
to the high recall of JSRE and the higher precision of
GraphKernel. Overall, GraphKernel outperformed JSRE
significantly on the in vivo dataset (F1: 84.97 % vs.
78.50 %), with a slightly lower F1 on the in vitro dataset
(F1: 65.58 % vs. 66.20 %). This indicates that there is room
for further improvement in the relation extraction from
the in vitro dataset.
As shown in Table 5, our approach outperformed SemRep significantly in terms of DEI relation extraction. One
possible reason could be that SemRep is a general information extraction tool for biomedical literature, which is
not focused on the DEI relation. On the other hand, our
model was trained on the datasets dedicated to DEI relations. Another possible reason is that instead of using
rule-based methods as in SemRep, our study applied statistical machine-learning model first to recognize related
drug-enzyme pairs to remove false positive DEI relation
pairs and to improve the performance. As an illustration,
in the sentence “the possibility of in vivo drug interaction
of azelastine and other drugs that are mainly metabolized
by CYP2D6”, the candidate relation pair of azelastine and
CYP2D6 matches the pattern of the isSubstrateOf relation. However, it is a false positive relation and is
removed in the first step by the statistical model.
Although for the drugs present both in our corpus and
DrugBank, only 42.02 % of inferred DDIs from the in
vivo dataset and 19.23 % from the in vitro dataset are
covered by DrugBank, manual examination demonstrated that our approach could find potential DDI relations with supportive evidence. For example, from the

Zhang et al. Journal of Biomedical Semantics (2016) 7:11

sentence “… and is probably caused by inhibition of
CYP3A4 -mediated voriconazole metabolism” (PMID:
16890574), we identified that the drug voriconazole is a
substrate of CYP3A4; meanwhile, from the sentence “…
oxcarbazepine (OXCZ) are well-known inducers of drug
metabolism via CYP3A4” (PMID: 17346248), we identified the relation that the drug oxcarbazepine is an inducer of CYP3A4. One potential interaction between
voriconazole and oxcarbazepine could then be inferred,
which is not listed in DrugBank. More examples of
inferred DDIs as well as their supportive evidence from
literature are listed in Table 8.
Despite the fact that our proposed method of DEI relation extraction achieved a F1 of 84.97 % on the in vivo
dataset, the F1 of 65.58 % obtained on the in vitro dataset is still low. Based on our empirical observation, the
major reason for the performance difference between
these two datasets lied in the essential difference of their
linguistic structures, which originated from the difference between the in vivo and in vitro studies. In vivo
studies focus on evaluating the effect of an investigational drug on other drugs, by checking the changes of
pharmacokinetic parameters. Different from in vivo
studies, in vitro studies can qualitatively provide the
mechanisms of a potential DDI based on the observation
of enzyme kinetics parameters. Thus, sentences in the in
vitro dataset contained more drug enzyme interactions;
whereas they were also much complex than those in the
in vivo dataset, with more multiple clauses, long conjunctive structures and rare patterns. When we looked
into the errors of DEI relation extraction, especially in
the in vitro dataset, we found that the major causes of
false negative instances include conjunctive structures of
drugs/enzymes (e.g., “Studies using the CYP3A4 inhibitors ketoconazole, troleandomycin, and erythromycin”),
and the rare patterns uncovered by the statistical model
(e.g. “Induction of CYP2C9 would explain the increased
systemic elimination of glipizide”). On the other hand,
the major causes of false positive instances include the

inability to catch the context information differentiating
between positive and negative relations (e.g., the word
“confirm” indicates the uncertainty of the DEI relation
in the sentence “… to confirm that fluvoxamine inhibits
CYP2C19”), and wrong predictions between drugs and
enzymes across multiple clauses, as in the sentence
“Greater inhibition was produced by the less selective
CYP3A inhibitors parathion, quinidine, and ketoconazole; CYP1A inhibitors were ineffective.”.
The above problems should be addressed in the future
to further improve the DEI relation extraction performance. Specifically, additional advanced methods tailored to
the in vitro dataset should be explored, including automatic pattern recognition methods to identify conjunctive
structures of drugs/enzymes, multiple clauses split before
feature extraction, keyword expansion to indicate the
uncertainty (e.g., “to determine” and “was examined”).
One limitation of our current work is the size of the
annotated corpus. For practical usage, we plan to apply
our system to all the related articles in PubMed to obtain a more comprehensive list of DEIs and potential
DDIs. Besides, further improvements of our system may
need to be conducted after evaluation on a larger DEI
corpus. In addition to narrative literature text describing
DEIs, tables of DEIs with details of interactions in the
published full text articles are another valuable resource
to obtain such information that we plan to incorporate.
Extracting DEIs from tables is more straightforward and
potentially have more accurate results as compared to
the text. However, in comparison to accessing titles and
abstracts of articles through MedLine, one problem of
tables is that the automatic access to full text is limited.
Actually, these two resources could be complementary
to each other for mining DEIs from biomedical literature. In our future work, methods of mining tables from
DEI related articles would be explored. Another drawback of our current approach for DDI relation inference
is that the information of specific conditions required
for the occurrence of DEIs and DDIs, such as dosages of

Enzyme Evidence

Carbamazepine/oxcarbazepine CYP3A4 We performed a study in healthy volunteers to investigate the relative inductive effect of CBZ and OXCZ
quinidine
on CYP3A4 activity using the metabolism of quinidine as a biomarker reaction…We confirm a clinically
significant inductive effect of both OXCZ and CBZ. (PMID: 17346248)
Lidocaine fluvoxamine

CYP1A2 Lidocaine is metabolized by cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) and CYP1A2 enzymes…We conclude that
inhibition of CYP1A2 by fluvoxamine considerably reduces the presystemic metabolism of oral lidocaine…
(PMID: 16918719)

Quinidine itraconazole

CYP3A4 Quinidine is eliminated mainly by CYP3A4-mediated metabolism… Itraconazole increases plasma concentrations
of oral quinidine, probably by inhibiting the CYP3A4 isozyme during the first-pass and elimination phases
of quinidine. (PMID: 9390107)

Propofol orphenadrine

CYP2B6 Involvement of human liver cytochrome P4502B6 in the metabolism of propofol… orphenadrine, a CYP2B6
inhibitor, reduced the rate constant of propofol by liver microsomes by 38 % (P < 0.05)… (PMID: 11298076)

Rifalazil fluconazole

CYP3A4 Rifalazil-32-hydroxylation in microsomes was completely inhibited by CYP3A4-specific inhibitors (fluconazole,
…) … indicating that the enzyme responsible for the rifalazil-32-hydroxylation is CYP3A4. (PMID: 10923859)

drugs, was not considered. Information of such conditions is also very critical for supportive evidence for DDI
relations, which should be taken into consideration in
the next step.

Conclusion
Our study proposes a hybrid approach of combining
machine-learning algorithm with rule-based patterns
to extract DEIs from biomedical literature, from which
potential DDI relations can be inferred by reasoning.
Evaluation results demonstrate that the performance
of DEI relation extraction outperformed SemRep significantly, with a F-measure of 84.97 % on the in vivo
dataset and 65.58 % on the in vitro dataset. Moreover,
potential DDIs not present in DrugBank were also
inferred, indicating that this proposed approach could
be used to detect DDIs supported by scientific evidence of
drug metabolism and interaction.
