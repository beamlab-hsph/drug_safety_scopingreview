Abstract
Background: Since the last review of vaccine safety surveillance data for erythema multiforme
(EM), Stevens Johnson syndrome (SJS), SJS/TEN, and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN)
(EM/SJS/TEN), over 37 new vaccines have been introduced in the United States. We sought to
describe reported EM/SJS/TEN after vaccines during 1999–2017.

Author Manuscript

Methods: We identified U.S. reports of EM/SJS/TEN received by the Vaccine Adverse Event
Reporting System (VAERS) during 1999–2017. We stratified analysis by condition (EM, SJS, or
TEN), and analyzed reports by serious or non-serious status, sex, age group, time from vaccination
to symptom onset, exposure to known causes of EM/SJS/TEN, and vaccines administered. We
used Empirical Bayesian data mining to detect vaccine-AE pairs reported more frequently than
expected.

Results: Of 466,027 reports to VAERS during 1999–2017, we identified 984 reports of EM, 89
reports of SJS, 6 reports of SJS/TEN, and 7 reports of TEN. Few reports of EM (9%), and most
reports of SJS (52%), SJS/TEN (100%), and TEN (100%) were serious. Overall, 55% of reports
described males, 48% described children aged < 4 years; 58% of EM/SJS/TEN occurred ≤ 7 days
after vaccination. Few reports (≤5%) described exposure to known causes of EM/SJS/TEN.
Overall, childhood vaccines (e.g., combined measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine) were most
commonly reported. We identified 6 deaths; 4 were exposed to medications associated with
EM/SJS/TEN. EM after smallpox vaccine was reported disproportionately among people aged 19–
49 years.
Conclusions: EM/SJS/TEN were rarely reported after vaccination; data mining identified a
known association between EM and smallpox vaccine.

Introduction

Author Manuscript

Dermatologic adverse events (AEs) are among the most frequently reported AEs after
vaccination. The most common dermatologic AEs are redness, swelling, and tenderness at
the injection site [1], which can occur in up to 90% of persons receiving vaccinations [2]. At
the other extreme are AEs, such as Henoch-Schönlein purpura after the combined measles,
mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine, for which only isolated case reports exist [3]. While
some dermatologic AEs can be common to many vaccines (such as tenderness at the
injection site), other dermatologic AEs can be specific to a particular vaccine, such as
vesicular lesions after varicella vaccine.

Author Manuscript

Some dermatologic AEs that have been reported to occur after vaccination involve
hypersensitivity reactions, such as an allergy to the aluminum in some adjuvanted vaccines
[4], or lichen planus after hepatitis B vaccine [5]. Erythema multiforme (EM) is a
hypersensitivity reaction characterized by papules, classically with a ringed, target-like
appearance often involving the palms of the hands and soles of the feet [1]. More severe
hypersensitivity reactions include Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal
necrolysis (TEN), both of which involve blistering and sloughing of skin. [6] SJS and TEN
also typically involve lesions on mucosal surfaces. SJS and TEN are thought to be related
conditions of varying severity, depending upon percentage of body surface area involved:
<10% for SJS, 10–30% for combined SJS/TEN, and >30% of body surface area for TEN
[7]. Fortunately, EM, SJS, and TEN are rare, occurring with a rate of 4.2 hospitalizations per
million person-years after exposure to an associated medication [8]; rates after vaccinations,
as of this writing, are unavailable.
Ball et al previously identified 99 reports of SJS, TEN, and serious reports of EM after
vaccination received by the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) during July
1990 through September 1999 [9]. Since 1999, over 37 vaccines have been approved for use
in the United States [10]. Thus, we searched and described reports of EM, SJS, SJS/TEN,

and TEN after vaccination (these specific dermatologic AEs will be referred to collectively
as EM/SJS/TEN) reported to VAERS during 1999–2017, and compared the relative
frequency of EM/SJS/TEN reported to VAERS by vaccine, to better understand if there are
any concerning patterns of reported EM/SJS/TEN (e.g., after a specific vaccine, or among a
particular age group) or other emerging safety concerns.

Methods
Data source

Author Manuscript

AEs occurring after vaccination can be reported to VAERS, a national spontaneous reporting
system established in 1990 to monitor AEs that is jointly administered by the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration [11,12].
VAERS receives reports from healthcare providers, vaccine manufacturers, vaccine
recipients, and other persons. Reported symptoms and diagnoses are coded using Medical
Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) Preferred Terms (PTs) [13]. MedDRA PTs
are not necessarily medically confirmed diagnoses, and multiple MedDRA PTs can be
assigned to a VAERS report. Federal regulations define a serious report as a report in which
one or more of the following conditions is reported: death, life-threatening illness,
hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, permanent disability, congenital
anomaly, or birth defect [14]. A report might therefore not be classified as serious, despite
describing a clinically severe presentation. VAERS personnel routinely request medical
records for non-manufacturer serious reports. Vaccine manufacturers that directly receive
reports of AEs typically request and review medical records per regulatory processes [12];
these records are not always available to manufacturers. Serious reports from vaccine
manufacturers therefore often do not contain medical records that VAERS personnel can
review.

Descriptive analysis
We searched the VAERS database for U.S. reports of EM/SJS/TEN following vaccination
received by VAERS during October 1, 1999, through December 31, 2017 (among reports
received by CDC and FDA through April 27, 2018); reports specifying a vaccination date
outside the analytic period were excluded. We searched for reports that included the PTs
“erythema multiforme,” “Stevens Johnson Syndrome,” and “toxic epidermal necrolysis.” We
also searched text fields for the following terms: “skin ulcer,” “blister,” “blister, infected,”
and/or “blister, rupture,” where “multiforme,” “John son,” and/or “necrolysis” was also
present. We combined results from both searches, then deduplicated records.

Author Manuscript

We reviewed the resulting reports for reports of EM/SJS/TEN that were diagnosed by
physicians (reported by a physician, or a physician’s diagnosis was documented in available
medical records). For reports of symptoms consistent with EM/SJS/TEN, but without a
physician’s diagnosis, we defined (1) EM as papular lesions, classically with a ringed
(“targetoid”) appearance, usually beginning peripherally and then spreading to the torso, that
could involve the palms of the hands and/or soles of the feet, without mucosal lesions; (2)
SJS as peeling or blistering of the skin with lesions on mucosal membranes that involved
<10% of total body surface area (BSA); (3) SJS/TEN as signs and symptoms consistent with

Vaccine. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2021 February 11.

SJS, but involving between 10 and 30% BSA; and (4) TEN as signs and symptoms
consistent with SJS, involving >30% BSA.

Author Manuscript

We stratified data by condition (EM, SJS, SJS/TEN, and TEN). For each condition, we
analyzed reports by sex; age group (<4 years, 4–10 years, 11–18 years, 19–49 years, ≥50
years, and age not reported), roughly corresponding with the recommended schedules for
vaccination [15]; seriousness of report (serious or non-serious); and time from vaccination to
onset of symptoms. Reports were further analyzed for persons with exposure to a known
trigger [8,10] proximal to onset of symptoms (viral or Mycoplasma infection, medications
(anticonvulsants, sulfa drugs, penicillins, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs),
macrolide antibiotics, and acetaminophen); history of predisposing conditions (past history
of EM/SJS/TEN, atopic dermatitis, asthma/reactive airway disorder, allergies to medications,
or malignancy) [16]; and whether vaccines were given alone or concomitantly with other
vaccines.
2.3.

Estimated reporting rates

Author Manuscript

Estimating reporting rates of AEs after vaccination using data from VAERS is challenging
because data about doses of vaccine that were distributed or administered are difficult to
obtain. However, we were able to estimate crude reporting rates of EM, SJS, SJS/ TEN, and
TEN after varicella vaccine using reports received during 2006 through 2016 as the
numerator, divided by doses distributed by the manufacturer [17] during the corresponding
time period (Merck and Company, Inc., personal communication) as the denominator; rates
were estimated as reports per 1 million doses distributed. For influenza vaccine (all types),
annual crude reporting rates for EM, SJS, SJS/TEN, and TEN were estimated during 2010
through 2017 using reports received as the numerator, with population estimates and vaccine
coverage for that year multiplied as the denominator [18,19]; rates for 2 age groups (1–17
years, ≥18 years) were estimated. From these annual crude reporting rates, median rates of
reports per million doses administered were estimated for 2010–2017.
2.4.

Data mining (disproportionate reporting)

Author Manuscript

We used Empirical Bayesian data mining to assess whether vaccine-AE combinations were
reported more frequently than expected (when compared to all other vaccine-AE
combinations in the VAERS database) using the Multi-Item Gamma Poisson Shrinker
(MGPS) algorithm [20]. We analyzed U.S. reports received by VAERS during October 1,
1999 – December 31, 2017 (received as of April 27, 2018). We stratified by age group (<4,
4–10, 11–18, 19–49, ≥50 years, and unreported), and adjusted for sex, and year in which the
report was received by VAERS. We analyzed disproportionate reporting for vaccineEM/SJS/TEN combinations using: (1) the PTs “erythema multiforme,” “Stevens Johnson
Syndrome,” and “toxic epidermal necrolysis”; and (2) PTs included in reports with the
words “skin ulcer,” “blister,” “blister infected,” or “blister rupture” in the narrative,
symptoms text, or comments fields, if the words “multiforme”, “Johnson”, and/or
“necrolysis” were also present. We conducted our analyses for all reports, and serious
reports only, in Oracle’s Empirica™ Signal System [20,21]. The main statistical scores
computed were the Empirical Bayes Geometric Mean (EBGM) and its associated 90%
confidence interval (EB05, EB95). We used the lower 5% bound of the 90% confidence

interval for an EBGM (EB05) of ≥2.0 as the threshold to define vaccine-AE combinations
reported at least twice as often as expected, indicating combinations of potential significance
[21].

Results
Descriptive analysis

Author Manuscript

Of 466,027 reports to VAERS during the analytic period [22], we identified 1086 (0.2%)
reports of EM/SJS/TEN. Overall, over half (51%) of reported EM occurred among children
aged <4 years (Table 1), with a median age of 3 years (range: <1 year to 89 years); among
reports of SJS, overall median age was 15 years (range: <1 year to 84 years). Most (91%)
reports of EM were non-serious, while most (52%) reports of SJS, and all reports of
SJS/TEN and TEN, were serious. Most reports of EM/SJS/TEN described onset of
symptoms within 14 days of vaccination; for cases of SJS with known time to onset, 71%
described onset of symptoms within 3 days of vaccination.

Author Manuscript

Few reports of EM/SJS/TEN described a known trigger or stimulus for these conditions near
when vaccine was administered (Table 2). No reports of SJS/TEN or TEN reported recent
infection (such as with Mycoplasma or herpes simplex virus 1). Of persons with a history of
EM/SJS/TEN, 4 had a similar reaction to past vaccination: (1) a female aged 15 months with
EM after varicella vaccine, who later experienced EM after combined measles, mumps, and
rubella (MMR) vaccine; (2) a female aged 2 years with EM after influenza vaccine, who
later experienced EM after influenza vaccine; (3) a male aged 10 years with EM after
combined diphtheria, tetanus, and acellular pertussis (DTaP), who later experienced EM
after a combined diphtheria tetanus booster; and (4) a male aged 27 years with SJS after
anthrax vaccine who later experienced SJS after another dose of anthrax vaccine. One
patient had an active malignancy: a male aged 78 years who was undergoing radiation
therapy for non-small cell lung cancer, who developed EM 4 days after receiving trivalent
inactivated influenza vaccine; notably, this patient had been taking phenytoin for 2 months
prior to developing EM.
The most commonly administered vaccines described in reports of EM/SJS/TEN were
vaccines commonly administered in infancy and childhood: MMR (22%), DTaP (18%),
varicella (18%), and 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate (13%) vaccines (Table 3). Among
reports describing the administration of only one vaccine, the most common vaccines were
smallpox (16%), trivalent inactivated influenza (15%), and varicella (7%) vaccines.
3.2.

Reported deaths

Author Manuscript

We identified 6 reports of persons who developed EM/SJS/TEN after vaccination, and
subsequently died (Table 4): 4 received medications known to trigger EM/SJS/TEN prior to
or at the time of vaccination. Two patients received varicella vaccine, and 2 patients received
inactivated trivalent influenza vaccine.

Estimated reporting rates

Author Manuscript

During 2006 through 2016, EM after varicella vaccine was reported to VAERS at an
estimated rate of 1.0 per 1 million doses distributed; SJS after varicella vaccine was reported
at an estimated rate of 0.1 per 1 million doses distributed. No reports of SJS/TEN or TEN
after varicella vaccine were identified. Regardless of age group, estimated median reporting
rates of EM, SJS, and TEN to VAERS during 2010 through 2017 after influenza vaccine (all
types) were ≤0.1, <0.1, and <0.1 per 1 million doses administered, respectively; no reports
of SJS/TEN after influenza vaccines were identified.
3.4.

Data mining (disproportionate reporting)

Author Manuscript

We found elevated data mining statistics (EB05 ≥ 2.0) for “erythema multiforme” following
smallpox vaccination among persons aged 19–49 years. When we restricted data mining
analyses to serious reports only, or to reports identified through text field searches, we did
not identify disproportional reporting for any vaccine-EM/SJS/TEN combination.

Discussion
Historically, EM/SJS/TEN have rarely been reported after vaccination [1]. Consistent with
this history, an analysis of VAERS reports during 1990 to 1999 found few reports of SJS
and/or TEN after vaccination [9]. Our analysis of VAERS data during 1999 through 2017
identified no new safety concerns, despite the introduction of several new vaccines since
1999. While these data are reassuring, new vaccines continue to be introduced to the market
[23,24]. Continued surveillance for increased reporting of EM/SJS/ TEN (SJS and TEN in
particular) is therefore warranted.

Author Manuscript

Data from a systematic review by Chahal et al. and case reports from other groups have
described median ages of 7 years for EM (range of <1–49 years) and 13–15 years (range of
1–75 years) for both SJS and TEN after vaccination [25,26]. The younger reported median
age for EM in our analysis might reflect the younger age at which persons receive most of
their vaccinations [15]. Reported sex was generally consistent with previous analyses [8,27].
Reported times from exposure to the suspected trigger, to onset of the rash, vary for SJS and
TEN, ranging from a median of 10 days to a median of 3 weeks or longer [28,29]. A median
of 6 days from vaccination to onset of EM has been observed [25]. Similarly, we observed
varying reported times to onset of symptoms after vaccination but found that most events
occurred within 14 days and rarely after 30 days; most SJS with known time to onset began
within 3 days of vaccination. Notably, AEs are frequently reported when occurring within a
short time after a potentially attributable trigger, regardless if a true association exists [30].

Author Manuscript

We observed no concerning patterns of reporting of EM/SJS/TEN after any particular
vaccine. Reported vaccines seemed to reflect age groups for which vaccines are
recommended: EM/SJS/TEN were mostly reported after childhood vaccines among persons
receiving multiple vaccines simultaneously, but mostly reported after smallpox and
inactivated influenza vaccines among persons receiving single vaccines (Table 3) [15,31].
Likewise, our data mining analyses identified no notable vaccine-AE combinations for
EM/SJS/TEN following vaccination overall. Data mining did identify disproportionate

reporting of EM following smallpox vaccination among persons aged 19–49 years. This age
distribution is consistent with the age ranges of military personnel and selected civilian
populations vaccinated due to concerns of potential bioterrorism and orthopoxvirus
outbreaks per U.S. vaccination policy [32–34]. EM is a well-documented complication of
smallpox vaccination, and the package insert for ACAM2000™ (live vaccinia virus
smallpox vaccine) includes a “boxed warning” alerting about the risk of “EM major” (i.e.,
SJS), following either primary vaccination or revaccination with live vaccinia virus smallpox
vaccine. Overall, our observations are consistent with previous descriptions of EM/SJS/TEN
after vaccination [35–37].

Author Manuscript

While prior episodes of EM/SJS/TEN in a patient might indicate a predisposition to
subsequent episodes, the likelihood of such an occurrence is unclear. Of the 4 persons we
describe who previously experienced EM or SJS after vaccination, two experienced another
episode of EM or SJS after the same vaccine (positive rechallenge). In a case series of nine
children with a history of SJS precipitated by Mycoplasma infection, one developed a
subsequent episode of SJS after a repeat infection with Mycoplasma [38,39]. Likewise,
persons with a history of EM after infection with herpes simplex virus (HSV) can develop
subsequent episodes of EM with recurrence of HSV [40]. However, our analysis (Table 2)
and reports by other investigators [41] describe few persons with exposure to known
precipitants of EM/SJS/TEN, or a history of allergies or other hyper-sensitivities. Notably, a
patient who experienced SJS after infection with wild-type influenza B virus received
multiple seasonal influenza vaccinations with no subsequent episodes of SJS [42]. Together,
these observations suggest further exploration into predisposing factors for EM/SJS/TEN,
including vaccines, is warranted.

Author Manuscript

SJS and TEN can be dire conditions, with case fatalities as high as 35% observed for TEN
[43]. Consistent with this observation, 5 of the 6 deaths among reports of EM/SJS/TEN after
vaccination had either TEN or SJS/TEN (Table 4). However, any association with
vaccination is dubious, given that 4 reports described receipt of a medication known to cause
SJS or TEN. Additionally, 1 report involved treatment for anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate
(NDMA) receptor encephalitis and subsequent TEN; while treatment was unspecified,
cyclophosphamide has been used to treat anti-NDMA receptor encephalitis and is known to
cause SJS and TEN [44,45]. The 1 report of death after EM described a woman who
experienced considerable vomiting, subsequent dehydration, and shock; the degree to which
EM contributed to her death is uncertain.

Author Manuscript

Previous investigators have estimated rates of EM/SJS/TEN after drug exposure as high as
200 per 1 million persons exposed (phenobarbital) [8]. Our estimated reporting rates of
EM/SJS/TEN after varicella and influenza vaccines were well below this figure (i.e., the
highest estimate was 1.0 report of EM per million doses of varicella vaccine distributed), a
notable observation considering that varicella vaccine was one of the most commonly
reported vaccines after which EM/SJS/TEN occurred. Despite potentially underestimating
rates, our data suggest that EM/SJS/TEN is reported no more frequently after vaccination
than after known causes of these conditions. Importantly, while EM/SJS/TEN can occur
after vaccination, previous post-marketing analyses and case-control studies demonstrate
that vaccination itself does not increase the likelihood of these conditions [46,47].

These data have limitations. As a passive reporting system, VAERS is subject to reporting
biases, under-reporting, inconsistent data quality and completeness, and changes in reporting
over time; reports to VAERS also lack an unvaccinated comparison group. These limitations
generally do not allow VAERS data to determine if a vaccine caused a particular adverse
event, including EM/SJS/TEN [11]. Because data on doses distributed or administered are
not available for many of the vaccines in this analysis, our ability to estimate reporting rates
for EM/SJS/TEN was limited to varicella and influenza vaccines and are likely
underestimates. Despite these limitations, results from data mining reflect known
associations (i.e., smallpox vaccine and EM) [48,49].

Author Manuscript

While EM (and to a lesser degree, SJS) is typically benign and self-limiting [1,50], SJS/TEN
and TEN can be life-threatening. [43] Surveillance for unexpected, increased reporting of
these conditions after vaccination should therefore continue. Fortunately, our observations
and the observations of other investigators [1,9] suggest that EM/SJS/TEN rarely occur after
vaccination.
