Abstract: Post-marketing detection and surveillance of potential safety hazards are crucial
tasks in pharmacovigilance. To uncover such safety risks, a wide set of techniques has
been developed for spontaneous reporting data and, more recently, for longitudinal data.
This paper gives a broad overview of the signal detection process and introduces some
types of data sources typically used. The most commonly applied signal detection
algorithms are presented, covering simple frequentistic methods like the proportional
reporting rate or the reporting odds ratio, more advanced Bayesian techniques for
spontaneous and longitudinal data, e.g., the Bayesian Confidence Propagation Neural
Network or the Multi-item Gamma-Poisson Shrinker and methods developed for
longitudinal data only, like the IC temporal pattern detection. Additionally, the problem of
adjustment for underlying confounding is discussed and the most common strategies to
automatically identify false-positive signals are addressed. A drug monitoring technique
based on Wald’s sequential probability ratio test is presented. For each method, a real-life
application is given, and a wide set of literature for further reading is referenced.

1. Introduction
Before releasing a newly developed drug to the market, a thorough assessment of the benefit-risk
profile of the drug is made. Despite the often vast efforts to get a clear understanding of a compound’s
impact on the body system, not every adverse drug reaction (ADR) may be spotted in
pre-market studies. Post-marketing strategies to detect unknown, and to monitor suspected, risks are of
high importance and have therefore led to the development of a wide variety of methodological
approaches to detect and follow up drug safety signals in recent decades. According to the World
Health Organization (WHO), a safety signal is defined as reported information on a possible causal
relationship between an adverse event and a drug, the relationship being unknown or incompletely
documented previously [1]. A more recent definition was given by the Council for International
Organizations of Medical Sciences (CIOMS) [2]: “Information that arises from one or multiple sources
(including observations and experiments), which suggests a new potentially causal association, or a
new aspect of a known association, between an intervention and an event or set of related events,
either adverse or beneficial, that is judged to be of sufficient likelihood to justify verificatory action.”
Here, terminology is used that addresses the inclusion of other sources of information besides ADR
reporting, reinforces the notion that a possible safety risk is only suggested, and takes into account the
needed verification of the potential association between drug exposure and clinical event [3]. Both
definitions interpret the term “signal” as a “signal of disproportionate reporting” as proposed by
Hauben and Reich [4], not a signal or “alert” as known from a clinical context, where an underlying
causality is strongly suspected and has undergone clinical review. This interpretation will also be used
throughout this paper.
During the last decades, post-marketing drug surveillance systems in pharmacovigilance
relied and still largely rely on spontaneous reporting (SR) data. Maintained by international and
national institutions as well as manufacturers, SR databases consist of voluntary reports of serious
ADRs after or during drug exposure provided by health care professionals, patients or the
pharmaceutical industry, whenever an association between an exposure to a drug and the observed
event is suspected [5,6]. Several data-mining techniques have been suggested and used to scan these
data collections for signals. SR databases are subject to certain well-documented limitations, such as
under-, over- and duplicate reporting, limited information on concomitant medication, or comorbidities
and the inability to provide the denominator, i.e., the number of subjects actually consuming the drug
of interest [7–9].
To overcome some of these limitations, and triggered by several severe safety issues in the last
years [10–13], programs have been initiated to make beneficial use of large data pools besides
spontaneous reports. An early pioneer in using electronic health care data for routine safety
surveillance is the Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD) [14] that started to study the adverse side effects of
vaccines in 1990. In 2007, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has started to establish the
Sentinel Initiative [15,16], which aims at the provision of electronic healthcare data consisting of
multiple sources like administrative and insurance claims databases. The target of the Sentinel system
is to capture data on more than 100 million individuals for active drug safety surveillance. In the wake
of this initiative, the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) [16,17], a public–private
partnership with the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA) and the FDA,

Pharmaceutics 2012, 4

609

launched by the Foundation for the National Institutes of Health, strives for improvements in
monitoring drugs for safety by researching methods that are feasible and useful to analyze existing
healthcare databases. As European counterpart the EU-wide “IMI-PROTECT Project”, a large
consortium involving the European Medicines Agency (EMA), academic institutions and the
pharmaceutical industry, pursues the goal of strengthening the benefit–risk monitoring of medicines in
Europe [18,19]. This endeavor includes the improvement of early and proactive signal detection from
spontaneous reports, electronic health records and clinical trials. Moreover, the European Union (EU)
has funded the EU-ADR project, where techniques were developed that allow mining for adverse drug
reactions in electronic health records (EHR) across European countries [20,21].
A variety of data-mining methods to detect unknown safety signals in SR databases has been
developed and established over the last decades, and new methodology that takes advantage of the
available longitudinal observational data is nascent. Furthermore, a multitude of drug surveillance
techniques has been proposed and tested. The goal of this paper is (1) to give a brief overview of the
signal detection process; (2) to describe how different sources of data can be used; (3) to present
data-mining methods widely used today, to describe sophisticated methods that were recently
developed especially for the use in longitudinal data and to highlight some of the surveillance
techniques; (4) to give an outlook on further methods and resources and (5) to discuss some of the
real-world applications of the presented methods.
Safety signals may also arise from literature reviews or from findings of pharmacoepidemiological
studies, e.g., cohort studies. Such studies are beyond the scope of this paper although they may be set
up on pharmacoepidemiological databases.
This paper is organized as follows: Section 2 gives an overview of the workflow in the signal
detection process. Section 3 does not only present well-established data sources and data sources that
recently became of interest for drug safety research, but also some strategies to prepare the different
data sources to make them suitable for signal detection. In Section 4, we discuss the most common
signal detection algorithms. We start by introducing simple frequentistic methods designed for SR data
and highlight their shortcomings, especially when applied to data with low event counts. These
shortcomings can be overcome by more advanced Bayesian techniques especially when frequency
counts are low. These techniques, however, ignore possible interactions between several drugs and
potential safety hazards, but they can be modified to also cope with this situation as will be shown.
Next, the Bayesian measures will be extended to longitudinal data by taking advantage of the
information on the duration of drug exposure in the data. Finally, some techniques are presented that
do not originate from the SR context and have been developed to take full advantage of longitudinal
information in the data. For each of the introduced methods, an application is presented and described
briefly. After discussing the problem of confounder adjustment in Section 5, we address the “triage”
step, where strategies are applied to automatically separate false-positive signals from those signals
that may indicate a safety hazard. Section 7 gives an outlook on techniques on how to monitor
potential safety signals over time, before a definite decision can be made whether to discard the signal
or to pursue it further. We close with a discussion in Section 8.

2. General Workflow
The process of signal detection comprises several phases (cf. Figure 1). The basis and one of the
most crucial parts is the collection and preparation of the data to be analyzed. Different types of data
with a variety of available information can be used, ranging from spontaneous reports of ADRs to
detailed information from Electronic Medical Records (EMRs). Based on these data, signal detection
analyses are conducted. We can coarsely distinguish between two different strategies to detect
safety hazards:
(1) Data-mining techniques that strive to uncover so far unknown and unsuspected associations.
These methods are usually applied to a broad range of combinations of drug exposures and
subsequent adverse events, often without limiting the search to pre-defined drug classes or
specific medical conditions. They can be regarded as a broad search over the whole spectrum of
drug-event combinations (DECs) in the underlying dataset.
(2) If the data-mining search has indicated a possible health risk with a certain DEC, it may be
advised to closely monitor this DEC over time to decide whether it should be considered
further in confirmatory studies. Surveillance techniques have been developed to consolidate
knowledge on these already suspected DECs and are often applied after the first data-mining
step.

After the detection of potential signals in the data-mining process, they have to be adjudicated
thoroughly to identify all DECs that (a) are already known and well documented; (b) occur very
seldom or (c) are highly implausible from a medical perspective and thus can be regarded as artificial
false-positive signals. This triage process is crucial in the entire signal detection process as, on the one
hand, it can drastically reduce the workload in the following steps, but on the other hand, it can also
lead to the dismissal of correctly identified safety signals. Subsequently, each remaining potential
signal has to be classified regarding its safety risk. This can either lead to immediate action like
confirmatory studies that can result in halt of marketing or even withdrawal of the drug, or given a
non-negligible but not critical risk—the decision to closely monitor the DEC via surveillance analysis
techniques, or to discard the potential signal as non-hazardous.
3. Data Sources
3.1. Overview
During the last years, the awareness of the need for extensive drug safety surveillance increased.
Programs were set up for a multitude of different data sources and studies were conducted to ascertain
whether these data could be of use to monitor unknown effects of drug exposure with signal
detection methods.
A wide variety of data sources is considered today [3], such as
 spontaneous reporting databases, like the WHO International Database [22], maintained at the
Uppsala Monitoring Centre (UMC) in Uppsala, Sweden; the European Union Drug Regulating
Authorities Pharmacovigilance database (EudraVigilance) or a multitude of national databases,
e.g., the Adverse Event Reporting System (AERS) as part of MedWatch, the FDA Safety
Information and Adverse Event Reporting Program, or the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting
System (VAERS);
 captured data of drug dispensing, e.g., by the New Zealand Intensive Medicines Monitoring
Programme [23];
 longitudinal administrative or claims databases from health insurance institutions, like the
Medicare database, based on the social insurance program in the U.S., or the German
Pharmacoepidemiological Research Database (GePaRD) [24];
 EMRs databases, like the General Practice Research Database (GPRD) in the UK, or data from
EHRs, or the Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD) project [14].
Additionally, types of data that were not available for signal detection before can now be exploited,
such as laboratory measurements stored in EMRs. In a recent study by Park et al. [25], the authors
presented a novel algorithm for detecting signals of ADRs using EMR data with focus on laboratory
abnormalities after drug exposure, and to evaluate the potential use of this method as a signal detection
tool. Moreover, information sources like medical internet forums or text mining in biomedical
literature [26] are becoming of interest. In general, it can be stated that nearly every data source that
contains information on health status and drug exposure can be of beneficial use for signal
detection purposes.

3.2. Spontaneous vs. Longitudinal Data
SR data are a valuable source of information, as the existing data collections cover very long time
periods. Furthermore, national spontaneous reporting systems are installed in numerous countries
besides the international data collections, such that a wide range of coverage is reached with these
data, both geographically and population-wide. Nonetheless, SR data can only shed light on small
sections of the subject’s medical history; the information contained in SR is punctual, that is, usually
focused on the day of the ADR only. Hence, SR data are merely a glimpse through a keyhole without
the possibility of seeing the full picture (cf. Figure 2). Moreover, as already stated, SR data bear a list
of well-known limitations. Since the SR system relies on the reporting of adverse drug reactions in the
first place, mainly by physicians, but also the consumers, the data from those sources inherently carry
an unknown proportion of under-reporting. The reports on ADRs from studies reported through the
pharmaceutical industry are considered more complete. SR data, however, also have the potential for
over-reporting, i.e., reports on ADRs that are not solely triggered by the expertise and suspicion of a
medical expert, but also influenced by other factors, e.g., extensive media coverage of newly suspected
adverse reactions after exposure to a certain drug. The fact that multiple actors may report to the
system can lead to duplicate reporting. One of the foremost problems from a methodological point of
view is the inability to provide incidence rates: SR data only cover subjects with a drug exposure and a
subsequent health event; they do not include data on exposed subjects without an event, so the number
of subjects actually consuming the drug of interest is not known. This does not allow for risk
assessment as in classical pharmacoepidemiological studies [7–9]. A further considerable drawback
when using SR data lies in the compliance of the reporters with the reporting system regarding the
timely feedback on suspected ADRs. A collection of SR data is of dramatically reduced value if ADRs
are reported with a significant delay, as pointed out by Ahmad [27]. Especially high-risk DECs need to
be detected as soon as possible, which is only possible if data are provided promptly.
Spontaneous reports are usually aggregated in drug-event report tables (cf. Table 1), containing the
essential information from the “raw” reports. These tables can be processed to be suited for statistical
analyses, but the statistical methodology is technically not limited to this data format, as discussed
later in this paper.

The use of longitudinal observational data like EHRs or health insurance claims data might widen
this narrow view considerably by providing information that is not directly connected with the actual
ADR. Although of different origin and different (primary) purpose, these longitudinal data usually
bear some key similarities, distinguishing them from SR data: they do not contain duplicates, are
typically derived automatically and are, therefore, largely unaffected by under- or over-reporting and
they include coherent information on most of the subject’s drug exposure periods (often via outpatient
drug prescriptions), clinically relevant events (independently from the exposure status) and—very
important—information on exposed subjects without events (cf. Figure 3). The assessment of drug
exposure and comorbidity status is much more complete as compared to SR data, while this does not
automatically imply that 100% of the information is collected. For instance, drug exposures usually are
only available for the outpatient setting, information on medications administered during
hospitalization periods is often not included. It is also well understood that these routinely collected
longitudinal data typically cannot provide information that is not needed for reimbursement, e.g., on
lifestyle factors like smoking behavior, alcohol consumption or anthropometric factors like body mass
index. This lack of information on lifestyle factors becomes crucial when risk estimates have to be
adjusted for potential confounders. A major limitation of most administrative data sources is the lack
of validation of the diagnostic coding. As the primary purpose of diagnoses in, for example, claims
data is reimbursement, a validation of the coded information against the original source (e.g., a
medical chart) is crucial. In the Mini-Sentinel project [28], such techniques for the validation of health
outcomes were reviewed on a wide set of outcomes [29]. Additionally, prescription or dispensation
data do not contain information of the patients’ compliance to the prescribed drug regimen; the actual
drug exposure usually remains unknown.

3.3. Data Preparation
The signal detection process starts with data preparation. Until today, many techniques operate on
frequencies of DECs, collated in 2 × 2 contingency tables, as given in Table 2. For each DEC ij
(i.e., drug i, ADR j) in question, such a table is constructed, e.g., in a database containing information
on 15,000 drugs and 15,000 ADRs, 225 million such contingency tables are produced and evaluated
during the data-mining process. All subsequent formulae refer to the nomenclature given in Table 2,
indices ij are omitted where convenient.

occurrences of adverse drug reaction (ADR) j as basis for signal detection.

n..

The definition of the single cells n11 to n00 in the 2 × 2 table highly depends on the level of
information contained in the underlying database.
SR data do not contain any information on the unexposed or event-free groups of the general
population. Thus, the definitions for “unexposed” and “no event” have to be adapted. “Unexposed” is
defined as exposure to any drug besides exposure to drug i, “no event” is similarly defined as
occurrence of any event apart from event j. According to these definitions, n11 is the number of reports
on DEC ij and n11 the number of reports on ADR j when exposed to other drugs than drug i.
Analogously, n10 and n00 are defined as the frequencies of reports on other ADRs when exposed to

Pharmaceutics 2012, 4

615

drug i or not exposed to drug i, respectively (cf. Figure 4(1)). In the recent literature [30–34],
approaches for the conversion of longitudinal data to 2 × 2 tables were proposed:
(a) The basic and most obvious approach is to create “pseudo”-SRs, trying to simulate the exact
data structure presented in Table 1. Then,
is defined as the number of DEC ij,
as the
number of events j while not under exposure i,
denotes all exposure periods to drug i with a
different ADR than event j and
is the number of non-j events under non-i exposure (cf.
Figure 4(2)). This is a coherent and convenient definition, suffering from the major deficit that
information on exposures without events and events without exposures is missing. This
approach was discussed and implemented by Schuemie [30] and Zorych et al. [35].
(b) Curtis et al. [34] proposed a method of converting longitudinal data to SR with the possibility
to additionally include information on non-exposures and non-events by introducing temporal
segmentation of the data. They considered each month per subject to be a single report,
consisting of all events that the subject experienced during this specific month and all drugs
that were consumed that month or the month before. Thus, reports similar to the structure
shown in Table 1 can be generated, plus reports that might contain information on exposures
without events or events without exposures (cf. Table 3). Here,
is defined as before and
is the sum of all reports on drug i without ADR j,
denotes the number of reports on DEC ij,
is—vice versa—the sum of all reports on ADR j without exposure to drug i and
the
number of reports containing neither drug i nor ADR j (cf. Figure 4(3)).
(c) A closely related approach to take advantage of the longitudinal information, but without
imitating a “reporting structure” was described by Schuemie [30] and Zorych et al. [35]. Here,
is defined as the number of distinct DECs ij,
and
stand for the number of all
exposure eras to drug i without the occurrence of ADR j or the number of ADRs j not
experienced during exposures to drug i, respectively. Finally,
is defined as the number of
all non-j events that occur during non-i exposure periods, event-free non-i exposure periods and
non-j ADRs when not exposed to any drug (also cf. Figure 4(3)).
(d) The final approach uses even more information than the one presented in c).
is defined as
number of individuals experiencing event while exposed to drug ,
and
are defined as
number of persons with exposure to drug and no occurrence of event , or an experienced
event and no exposure to drug , respectively. Finally,
includes all individuals that were
neither exposed to any drug, nor experienced any ADR (cf. Figure 4(4)). Thus,
equals the number of all subjects contained in the database.
These might not be all approaches currently discussed in the literature, but this overview gives an
adequate insight in the basic ideas.

3.4. Definition of Exposure and Event in Longitudinal Data
A crucial step in converting longitudinal data is the definition of what needs to be considered as
“event” and “exposure.”
The estimation of drug exposures depends on the type of available information; often drug
prescriptions are considered as a suitable surrogate if exposure information is not directly available.
The estimation of the exposure duration is usually constrained by the lack of information on the actual
adherence to the prescribed drug regimen. If information on dosing regimen is available, this
information can be used to estimate the exposure duration, whereas the number of dispensed units and
the defined daily dose (DDD) may be used as substitute [36]; actual drug use can also be estimated
from repeated prescriptions when focusing on chronic diseases. A thorough discussion of the definition
and calculation of exposed and unexposed person-time is given by Brown et al. [37].
An event may be defined as hospitalization due to an emerging illness, an event under drug
exposure could then be defined as hospitalization with a preceding drug prescription within a fixed
timeframe before the onset of the event. Although this timeframe highly depends on the drug
considered, a fixed timeframe usually is chosen for all drugs and events for practical reasons. For
instance, Choi et al. [31,32] and Kim et al. [33] consider 12 weeks before the event to be a suitable
timeframe to look for the target drug exposure.
4. Analysis Techniques
4.1. Overview
Basically, two methodological approaches to detect safety signals can be identified in the recent
literature, First, there are the data-mining techniques that operate cross-sectionally on a single data
snapshot (non-sequential methods), where the disproportionality analysis methods comprise the most
widely applied class of analytical techniques [38]. These methods will be discussed in this section.
Second, there are the surveillance methods that sequentially calculate a cumulated risk estimate over a
sequence of data snapshots, taken at different points in time (sequential methods), where approaches
based on Wald’s Sequential Probability Ratio Test (SPRT) [39,40] are among the applied methods.
These methods are typically not applied to detect yet-unknown safety hazards, but to monitor DECs
where a health risk is of concern. These surveillance techniques will be reviewed briefly in Section 7
of this paper.
Besides these highly automated methods, traditional approaches like reviews of single cases or case
series, literature reviews or results from pharmacoepidemiological studies (e.g., cohort designs or
case-control designs) can yield safety signals, but these methods usually need manual input, such as
appropriate confounder selection, and are not suited to automatically process large quantities of
different drug exposures and ADRs in a reasonable timeframe and are thus not considered here.
As part of the large governmentally funded initiatives mentioned before, development of new
methodology in drug safety has taken a big leap forward after the start of the Sentinel Initiative and the
OMOP collaborative. Extensive methods libraries with accompanying documentation material were set
up, most prominently the documentation regarding the single working areas in the Mini-Sentinel [16,41]
pilot program or the OMOP methods library [42]. The latter profited largely from the so called

Pharmaceutics 2012, 4

618

“OMOP cup,” a competition to promote methods development and evaluation of novel algorithms for
identifying drug safety issues in observational healthcare data, proclaimed in 2009.
4.2. Disproportionality Analysis Measures for Spontaneous Reporting Data
Disproportionality analysis measures are constructed to identify combinations of drug exposures
and ADRs that occur disproportionately often, compared to other drug-event combinations. Originally
developed for SR data, disproportionality measures can also be directly applied to longitudinal data.
Several different disproportionality measures have been proposed in the literature [35,43–48], which
can generally be divided into two categories: frequentistic and Bayesian, both relying on the
aforementioned 2 × 2 contingency tables. The most popular frequentistic methods are the proportional
reporting rate (PRR) [48] and the reporting odds ratio (ROR) [44]; among the Bayesian approaches the
Bayesian Confidence Propagation Neural Network (BCPNN) [47] and the Gamma-Poisson Shrinker
(GPS) [45] (respectively, its extension, the Multi-item Gamma-Poisson Shrinker, MGPS [46]) are the
most prominent and widely used techniques.
As the results of signal detection analyses are usually referred to as “risk” estimates, one might
assume that they can be directly compared to risk estimates obtained from case-control or cohort
studies in pharmacoepidemiology. This is, however, not the case, as SR data do not contain
information on subjects under drug exposure who did not experience a health event, so that “risks”
cannot be appropriately estimated. The “risk” estimates obtained from SR data merely serve as a tool
to identify the most suspicious signals. These signals then need to be examined further in the signal
adjudication step.
4.2.1. PRR and ROR—Simple Measures
The most basic frequentist disproportionality analysis measures that are widely used are the PRR
and the ROR. Their estimators are defined similarly to the estimators of the relative risk (RR) and the
odds ratio (OR) with:
PRR

[49]

(4)

The estimates for PRR and ROR are easy to calculate, but the results tend to become unstable when
the number of events is small, resulting in large estimates with wide confidence intervals [3,45,50],

Pharmaceutics 2012, 4

619

thus leading to many false-positive signals for very rare events. To uncover these false-positive
signals, for instance, the biological plausibility has to be examined and/or confirmatory studies to
re-assess the found signals using additional data sources have to be conducted (see also Section 6 of
this paper).
As pointed out by van Puijenbroeck et al. [44] and Bousquet et al. [51], other statistical methods
usually applied in cross-classification tables can also be exploited, such as the -test with one degree
of freedom (with or without Yates’s correction [52]), where a relevant signal would then require a
-value greater than the corresponding 95% quantile ; .
3.85 [50]. Further, rarely applied
methods include the crude relative risk (cRR) or Yule’s Q-test [53]. The problems that may arise when
using such fixed thresholds are discussed in Section 6 below.
4.2.2. BCPNN and GPS—Bayesian Shrinkage
The instability of the above estimators when applied to low drug-event counts led to the
development of more advanced Bayesian shrinkage techniques. The two methods mainly used today
are the BCPNN, applied at the UMC to analyze the WHO database, and the MGPS, based on the GPS
and deployed on the SR data of the FDA.
Both methods are based on the relative reporting ratio (RRR), defined as
drug , ADR
drug
ADR

RRR

(5)

with drug denoting the probability of a target exposure being reported, ADR the probability
of the target event being reported and drug , ADR the joint probability of a report on the target
event under exposure to the target drug. In a frequentistic approach, RRR is estimated as
RRR

··
·

(6)

·

The RRR can easily be interpreted: it simply is the ratio of how many ADRs under exposure were
actually observed over the number of expected events under the assumption that ADR and drug
exposure were independent.
Based on this simple definition of the RRR, the BCPNN estimates the information component (IC),
a measure of mutual information between two variables, originating from information theory [54]. It is
defined as
IC

log RRR

(7)

The Bayesian approach underlying the theoretical concept of the BCPNN assumes binomial
distributions for both variables and a multinomial distribution for the joint probability. Due to the
convenient analytical characteristics of conjugate distributions in Bayesian theory [55], the prior
distributions are assumed to be the conjugate priors of binomial and multinomial variables, namely
beta distributions. Let
Beta α , α and
Beta β , β be random variables to describe the
occurrence of drug exposure and ADR , respectively. The a priori expectations of and are
obtained as:

After inclusion of the information given in the SR data, a closed form of the a posteriori

An estimate for the credibility interval (CredI) of the IC using Monte-Carlo simulations is given by
Norén et al. [57].
As an alternative, DuMouchel proposed the so-called Gamma-Poisson Shrinker (GPS) algorithm [45].
Here, the occurrence of the target DEC is considered as rare event such that the observed DEC count
may be assumed as realization of a Poisson-distributed random variable. According to the GPS,
the relative reporting rate is defined as
µ

λ

(10)

where µ is the mean of the Poisson distribution of
and is the expected event count under the
assumption that drug exposure and ADR are independent and is estimated as
·

·

(11)

··

Following a Bayesian approach, µ is not considered as a fixed parameter, but as random, hence λ is
also considered to be a random variable. The assumption of an underlying Poisson distribution for
leads to a gamma distribution as conjugate prior for λ. To add flexibility to the model, a mixture of two
gamma distributions with initially unknown mixture parameter is assumed as distribution of λ:
λ|p, α , β , α , β

where nb · denotes the negative binomial distribution. The resulting risk measure, the so-called
“empirical Bayesian geometric mean” (EBGM) is defined as
EBGM

(14)

The EBGM is then estimated by a plug-in approach, where is estimated as shown in Equation 11,
and the parameters α , α , β , β and are obtained from the data using an empirical Bayes approach.
The fifth percentile of the posterior distribution of λ is denoted as “EB05” and interpreted as the lower
one-sided 95% confidence limit for the EBGM, the upper one-sided 95% CI is defined analogously as
95th percentile. This Bayesian estimator gives more conservative risk estimates when event counts are
small, i.e., the risk estimates are considerably smaller and the CIs less wide, hence the denomination
“shrinkage estimate.” While this shrinkage might obfuscate a real signal by reducing it to a
non-conspicuous level, it helps to eliminate false-positive signals, which otherwise would have to be
adjudicated subsequently.
Most of the aforementioned analysis techniques (PRR, ROR, BCPNN, GPS) are implemented in the
“PhViD” package [58] for the statistical software R [59].
4.2.3. Extension of the GPS: the MGPS
The techniques discussed so far assess the risk of 2-way DECs, i.e., one drug and one ADR.
Another serious concern is due to potential interactions between several drugs taken simultaneously in
relation to the occurrence of an ADR. For the sake of simplicity, let us assume that we are interested in
a specific ADR, denoted as , and in two drugs , , where neither exposure to
nor
alone
results in an elevated risk for A. If the joint exposure to both drugs poses a safety risk, this risk would
not be detected in two-way analyses. A famous example is the interaction of cerivastatin and
gemfibrozil, leading to an elevated risk of rhabdomyolysis and resulting in the withdrawal of
cerivastatin [11,60] from the worldwide market in 2001.
DuMouchel and Pregibon [46] introduced the Multi-item Gamma-Poisson Shrinker (MGPS) as an
extension of the GPS algorithm in 2001 to deal with multi-item sets of a size
2 (e.g.,
3;
drug-drug-event interactions). The basic idea is to assess how much of the observed frequency of the
joint occurrence of the multi-item-set can be explained by the occurrence of all
1 possible
two-way interactions in the set of
above set of two drugs
,

1 drugs under inspection and the event of interest. Given the
and one ADR
, the number
of reports on
after

simultaneous exposure to
and
is considered to be “interesting” if the number of reports
involving the two-way interactions (i.e.,
,
and
) does not explain the observed
count of the triplet. A log-linear analysis can be conducted to determine if any of the observed
frequencies of the two-way combinations depends on the third item. From this analysis one obtains an
estimate All2F of the frequency of reports on the joint occurrence of ,
and if all associations
were strictly pairwise and independent from the third item. DuMouchel and Pregibon define the
and over what might be expected if all
EXCESS2 value as number of excess reports on ,
associations were only pairwise:
EXCESS2

EBGM

All2F

Pharmaceutics 2012, 4

622

Thus, high EXCESS2 values of an examined triplet might indicate that a safety risk is given under
combined exposure to
and . This approach may also be extended to higher interaction levels [46]. A
variety of approaches to properly handle multi-item associations can be found for example in von
Puijenbroek et al. [61,62], Norén et al. [57,63], Almenoff et al. [43] or Madigan et al. [38].
4.3. Analysis Techniques for Longitudinal Data
4.3.1. Adaptation of the MGPS for Longitudinal Data: the LGPS
For the analysis of longitudinal observational data (e.g., claims data), one option is to convert the
data structure to match the structure of SR data, so that the aforementioned techniques can be applied
directly. An additional option is to modify the algorithms to better fit the structure of longitudinal data
and take full advantage of the available information.
Key information in longitudinal studies includes the number of days a patient was under risk, i.e.,
the number of days the patient was exposed to the target drug. Let denote the number of days the
patient was under risk, the number of days the patient was observed without being under risk, and
the number of ADRs when not exposed to drug . Then, according to Schuemie [30] the expected
number
of DECs ij can be estimated as:
(15)

assuming that the risk is time-invariant. Replacing from Equation 11 by Equation 15 to get the
plug-in estimator of EBGM (Equation 14) leads to the “longitudinal” GPS (LGPS) algorithm suggested by
Schuemie [30].
4.3.2. Self-Controlled Case Series
The “self-controlled case series” (SCCS), introduced by Farrington [64] in 1995, can be used to
study the temporal association between a time-varying drug exposure and an adverse event using data
from cases only. The basic idea of the SCCS is to compare the incidence rate of the event of interest in
periods when the individual was exposed to the drug of interest to periods without such exposure. Each
case acts as its own control, thereby controlling for both measured and unmeasured confounding
variables that do not vary over time, which is the key advantage of the method. Initially developed to
study the risk profile of vaccines, it gained wide recognition when used to examine the effect of
vaccination for mumps, measles and rubella (MMR) on autism [65].
For each individual , risk periods ,
1,2, …, are identified from the data, i.e., windows of
time either during or directly after drug exposure. Any other time periods in the observation period for
subject
are considered to constitute the control periods, indexed by
0 . Moreover, the
observation period for individual is split into age groups to incorporate the effect of aging. The
occurrence of events is assumed to follow a non-homogeneous, age-dependent Poisson process.

can be fitted using standard statistical analysis software such as STATA [66] or SAS [67].
Hocine et al. [68] based a technique for near real-time drug surveillance on the SCCS (see Section 7.3).
Besides the SCCS, other case-only methods are also used in pharmacovigilance, but not as
prominently as the SCCS. A variety of case-only approaches was discussed by Maclure et al. [69] with
respect to their usefulness for safety monitoring.
4.3.3. IC Temporal Pattern Discovery
Norén et al. [70] introduced a technique to identify patterns in the temporal association between the
prescription of a drug and the occurrence of a medical event, the “IC temporal pattern discovery”
(ICTPD). The method is, very similar to the SCCS, based on the intra-personal comparison of a risk
period and a preceding control period. A main difference to the SCCS technique, though, lies in the
additional use of information from non-cases, as the ICTPD is mainly focused on the exposure to a
certain drug. The methodology is based on a disproportionality approach such as presented in the
previous section, where the observed number of ADRs in a certain time period is contrasted to an
expected number based on the overall frequency of the ADR relative to other drugs, which is
analogous to the approach in Equation 5, but dependent on the time-window . Thus, let further
denote the number of prescriptions of drug with a subsequent event in the time-window ,
the
number of prescriptions to any drug with a subsequent event in time-window ,
the number of
prescription of drug and any subsequent event in time period t, and
the number of any
prescription, followed by any event in time period . Then the IC, defined in Equation 7, for the time
window can be estimated as
IC

(18)

with
(19)

Pharmaceutics 2012, 4

624

As described before, the ratio in Equation 18 is sensitive to small event counts, thus, Norén et al. [70]
proposed a modification of the IC by adding to both the nominator an the denominator, resulting in
a general shrinkage towards 0.
Based on this definition of the IC, the authors constructed a measure of temporal association. Let
be the time period of primary interest, i.e., the time period after a current drug prescription of drug ,
and a control time period, against which is to be contrasted. Considering the difference
log

log

(20)

and rewriting it, the measure ICΔ can be estimated as
ICΔ

log

(21)

with
(23)

This estimate ICΔ , the shrunk difference between the log observed-to-expected ratios in time periods
and , can distinguish true temporal associations between an exposure to drug and the occurrence of
an ADR from a potential tendency of the joint occurrence of and in the same patients.
For further information, e.g., on choices of and , the possibility of stratification to adjust for
confounding and a sophisticated graphical representation of the ICΔ estimates (the so-called
“chronographs”) and their interpretation, we refer to Norén et al. [70].
4.4. Applications
In the following, sample applications for each analysis technique are presented.
4.4.1. Application of the Disproportionality Measures
Several recent studies used data from the Korean Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service
(HIRA), a database including all claims data and prescriptions from approximately 50 million
Koreans. In 2010, Choi et al. [31] examined the risk profile of rosuvastatin compared to other statins in
a population of approximately 1.1 million elderly patients (≥65 years), based on nearly 12 million drug
prescriptions by calculating the crude relative risk (cRR) as signal detection method. Target outcomes
were several clinical conditions associated with statin use, divided in ADRs for rosuvastain and all
other statins. They found 25 signals for rosuvastatin, including 8 that were expected only for this drug,
11 that were expected only for other statins and 6 that were not expected for any of the statins
investigated. They considered the cRR measure to be an efficient data-mining tool.
In 2011, Choi et al. [32] used the same data to assess the risk of analgesics and anti-inflammatory
drugs (AAIDs) in the same cohort of elderly patients. A wider set of signal detection methods was
applied: PRR, ROR, BCPNN and the cRR. According to their results, the cRR seems to be the
measure with the highest sensitivity and specificity.

Pharmaceutics 2012, 4

625

Zorych et al. [35] used simulated data generated with the Observational Medical Dataset Simulator
(OSIM) [71,72] plus anonymized Thomson Reuters MarketScan databases [73]: the lab data (MSLR),
the Medicaid Multi-State database (MDCD), the Medicare Supplemental and Coordination of Benefits
database (MDCR), and the Commercial Claims and Encounters database (CCAE). They did not focus
on specific events or drugs, but ran database-wide analyses across all events and drugs present in the
data using the four most common data-mining techniques: PRR, ROR, BCPNN and MGPS. According
to the results from the simulated as well as from the real data Bayesian techniques showed better
performances than PRR and ROR.
4.4.2. Application of the LGPS
Schuemie [30] also used data generated from the OSIM and real-life data from the Integrated
Primary Care Information (IPCI) [74] database from the Netherlands. He focused on detecting the
signals that were artificially defined during the simulation process. He applied the longitudinal LGPS
algorithm in comparison to other variants of the GPS, and LGPS showed the best performance.
Schuemie considered his approach to be highly suitable for signal detection, which is underpinned by
the fact that he won the aforementioned OMOP cup in 2010 with the LGPS approach. The LGPS is
also successfully applied by the EU-ADR consortium, that examines the combined healthcare data of
eight European databases [21,75] for safety signals.
4.4.3. Comparative Studies
Two recent studies by Schuemie et al. [75] and Ryan et al. [76] compared a wide set of
methodological approaches for risk identification in longitudinal data. Schuemie et al. assessed the
performance of ten different methods, ranging from the simple PRR and ROR to elaborated techniques
like the LGPS or SCCS on a dataset comprising information from seven European health care
databases, including over 20 million individuals. They examined for each method its ability to detect
pre-defined known signals and associations unlikely to represent an ADR (negative controls).
Additionally they applied a technique to assess protopathic bias (“LEOPARD”, presented by Schuemie [30],
which is briefly discussed in section 6 of this paper) in combination with each of the ten signal
detection techniques. They found that the performance of the methods did not differ too much, but that
the LGPS and a matched case-control design outperformed the other approaches, whereas the
techniques originally designed for SR data fell behind slightly. The filtering for protopathic bias
increased the performance for each of the ten methods under inspection.
An analogous approach was made by Ryan et al. [76], who compared eight out of 13 analytical
methods that were implemented during the OMOP, e.g., disproportionality measures adapted from the
SR data analysis, ICTPD, univariate SCCS or a cohort design based on a high-dimensional propensity
score (HDPS) stratification [77,78] (cf. Section 5 of this paper for details on the HDPS technique). The
analyses were based on a combination of various health care databases, covering about 130 million
patients. The authors assessed a total of 53 DECs, where nine were true signals and 44 negative
controls. For each analysis technique, a variation of method-dependent parameter settings was studied.
A set of performance measures was included to rate the performance of the methods, e.g., the area
under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) [79] or the average precision (AP) [80].

Pharmaceutics 2012, 4

626

The authors found the cohort design based on HDPS adjustments to be the most predictive, followed
by the ICTPD and the univariate SCCS. Similar to the results of Schuemie et al., the disproportionality
measures originating from the SR data analysis were among the least predictive models. All assessed
methods that were developed in the OMOP are freely accessible in the OMOP methods library [42].
5. Confounder Adjustment
A largely unsolved problem is the adjustment for confounding, as pointed out by Lu [81] or Hauben
and Bate [9,50]. It is important to ensure that confounding does not produce spurious safety signal
warnings of non-existing hazards. With longitudinal data, information on some relevant confounding
factors is at hand (e.g., concomitant medication or comorbidities), although other potential
confounders are usually still lacking, such as smoking behavior or alcohol consumption. Adjustment
for underlying confounding is not per se part of signal detection techniques, especially not of the
simpler ones (PRR, ROR), but can partially be achieved by stratification for certain variables, like sex
and/or age (groups). The disproportionality measures can then be calculated per stratum, although
stratification usually comes at the cost of more sparse data tables, thus jeopardizing the stability of the
statistical analyses if event counts are low.
To adjust study results for confounders, a lot of sophisticated approaches exist for
pharmacoepidemiological study designs, which can, however, not easily be exploited for signal
detection methods in the pharmacovigilance context. As a major problem, the selection of the
appropriate confounders that have an impact on the outcome is usually a manual process, involving
expertise from various scientific disciplines. For high-throughput signal detection methods this is not
feasible, and automated solutions would be needed. This problem was addressed by Schneeweiss et al.
with the introduction and application of high-dimensional propensity scores (HDPS) [77,78], a
technique based on the propensity score (PS) introduced by Rosenbaum and Rubin [82]. The HDPS
algorithm automates the selection of potential confounders to be considered in a multi-step approach.
Briefly, the HDPS algorithm
(1) requires the identification of the different data dimensions (e.g., hospitalization data, outpatient
care data, outpatient drug dispensation data) in the database;
(2) identifies a pre-specified number of the top most prevalent codes, e.g., ICD or ATC codes
(ICD = international statistical classification of diseases and related health problems,
ATC = anatomical therapeutic chemical classification system) in each data dimension as
candidate covariates;
(3) ranks candidate covariates based on their recurrence (the frequency that the codes are recorded
for each individual during the baseline period);
(4) ranks covariates across all data dimensions by their potential for control of confounding based
on the bivariate associations of each covariate with the treatment and with the outcome;
(5) selects a pre-specified number of covariates from Step 4 (e.g., 500) for PS modeling, and
(6) estimates the PS based on multivariable logistic regression using the selected covariates plus
any pre-specified covariates.

Pharmaceutics 2012, 4

627

This technique theoretically allows for a fully automated selection of confounders for each signal
detection analysis. Rassen and Schneeweiss [78] applied the HDPS to control for confounding in
sequential database cohort studies. They concluded that HDPS offers substantial advantages over
non-automated alternatives in active product safety monitoring systems. In the comparative study by
Ryan et al. [76], the HDPS stratified cohort design turned out to lead to the best predictive model.
Garbe et al. [83] compared the performance of the HDPS vs. conventional PS with manual confounder
selection, using data from the German Pharmacoepidemiological Research Database (GePaRD). Here,
the comparison of HDPS and conventional PS matching resulted in improved point estimates for the
HDPS when studying an intended treatment effect of coxibs versus traditional non-steroidal
anti-inflammatory drugs, benchmarked against results from randomized controlled trials.
A common approach to adjust for confounders in pharmacoepidemiological studies is the use of a
multiple logistic regression model [84]. In the pharmacovigilance setting with often >10,000
covariates present, confounding theoretically can be introduced by any of these covariates. Regression
against all of these possible confounders bears (a) theoretical problems and (b) until recently also
technical problems in terms of necessary computing time. Although methodology for automated
selection of confounders is developing (e.g., HDPS), advanced logistic regression models are also
considered. Genkin et al. [85] proposed a Bayesian logistic regression (BLR), where millions of
confounders can be included in the analysis. The BLR was applied to the WHO SR database at the
UMC by Caster et al. [86], and they concluded that the BLR does offer practical advantages, as it can
eliminate false-positives and false-negatives due to other covariates, and it identifies some established
drug safety issues earlier than a measure based on contingency tables.
A different approach to adjust for unmeasured and measured time-invariant confounding is taken in
the case-only methods, such as SCCS (cf. Section 4 of this paper, see also especially Hocine et al. [68]
and Maclure et al. [69]). Here, as already mentioned, each case is its own control, thereby controlling
for both measured and unmeasured confounding variables that do not vary over time, such as sex,
genetic predispositions or general state of health.
6. Triage—Adjudication of Potential Signals
When the potential signals have been identified by one of the described analytical methods, the
impact and the importance of each identified potential signal have to be evaluated. The aim of this
adjudication process is the identification of those signals that are likely to indicate a yet-unidentified
safety hazard, and the elimination of false-positives from the results. The sheer number of DECs
usually under examination, especially when data-mining methods are applied, makes a structured
adjudication of the results a necessity.
First, the plethora of potential signals needs to be reduced by application of a set of basic rules. In
EudraVigilance, only signals that are based on three cases or more, show a risk estimate of 2 or higher
and have a lower confidence limit greater than 1 are considered relevant. A different approach may be
based on a -test with one degree of freedom, where a relevant signal would then require a -value
greater than 3.85 [50]. Such simple rules can drastically reduce the amount of potential signals to be
processed. A different approach to reduce the number of potential signals is not to focus on the risk
estimates from the signal detection, but on a fixed number R of potential signals that will remain. The

Pharmaceutics 2012, 4

628

list of analyzed DECs is ordered by the size of the respective risk estimates and cut after the top R
entries. More sophisticated approaches were suggested by Ahmed et al. [87,88] where “rules of
thumbs,” e.g., any reliance on fixed thresholds and the estimated 95% confidence interval were
avoided. Here, the decision criterion relies on the estimation of the false discovery rate (FDR) [89].
Bayesian and non-Bayesian FDR-based methods were proposed that address the arbitrariness of
thresholds and allow for a built-in estimate of the FDR. Simulation studies indicated that these
methods can be suitable alternatives to the currently used methods; see [88] for more details.
After having reduced the number of potential signals by mere technical restrictions, the remainders
need to be assessed on a qualitative level. A common step is to exclude—automatically if possible—all
known and well-documented risks and to focus on the unknown or unexpected identified signals. The
exact layout of this part of the triage highly depends on a number of factors, including the underlying
data structure, the signal detection method used and personnel resources, as in-depth medical and
pharmacological knowledge is necessary. No globally standardized modus operandi can be defined,
but many institutions assessing drug safety data utilize a defined set of triage criteria. For instance, the
WHO criteria applied at UMC have been well documented by Ståhl et al. [90], Lindquist [91] and
Hauben and Bate [50] and include several different aspects like the public health impact of the
outcome, novelty of the drug in the market or comparison of the results with prior analyses.
Besides these qualitative assessments, other sources of false-positive signals can be identified, for
instance cases of protopathic bias [92], when a drug is administered to treat the condition in question,
thus leading to reverse causality in the signal detection process. Schuemie [30] proposed a framework
to identify signals caused by such a bias, the Longitudinal Evaluation of Observational Profiles of
Adverse Events Related to Drugs (LEOPARD). It is based on the comparison of prescription rates of
the drug under consideration in time windows before and after the event, and a potential signal is
considered to be protopathic if the number of prescriptions after the event is higher relative to the
prescriptions before the event.
Once the triage is completed, the safety risk of every remaining signal needs to be rated to decide
whether (a) impact analyses and subsequent confirmatory analyses need to be induced; (b) the signal
should be monitored to sharpen the risk profile or (c) the signal can be discarded because of low
potential risk. Schneeweiss [93] proposed a systematic approach for these confirmatory steps.
7. Near Real-Time Surveillance Techniques
If a certain DEC is suspected to bear a safety hazard after the data-mining process, but no certain
assertion for an elevated risk can be made yet, it might be advisable to monitor the respective DEC
closely. It would be most preferable to assess the risk profile of the active agent of concern in
real-time, i.e., whenever new information is available, or in near real-time, i.e., at regular short
intervals. For this purpose, classical sequential tests might be applied as e.g., Wald’s Sequential
Probability Ratio Test (SPRT). Wald’s approach is based on the simple null hypothesis :RR 1 vs.
the simple alternative :RR r with a known fixed r 1. Let be a Poisson-distributed random
variable representing the number of observed adverse events at time with means λ and rλ under the
null and the alternative hypothesis, respectively, the realization of . Wald’s approach is based on
the repeated assessment of the likelihood ratio test statistic

LLR is calculated at each point in time
0 as additional data are included. To decide whether the
null hypothesis or the alternative is assumed to be true, the obtained value of the test statistic is
compared to a lower and an upper critical value. For a given significance level α and a power of
1 β, the null hypothesis is accepted if LLR
log
, the alternative is accepted if LLR
log
.
If LLR lies between these values, no decision can be made and additional data are needed.
This approach is of limited practical value for the assessment of an unknown drug risk for two main
reasons. First, the simple alternative :RR r requires the magnitude r of the elevated risk to be
known, which is usually not the case as one is merely interested in an unknown elevated risk RR 1.
Second, the baseline frequency also needs to be known as it is part of the test statistic. This is not
always the case.
7.1. Extensions
To overcome the first of these two restrictions, Kulldorff et al. [94] introduced the MaxSPRT,
extending Wald’s original approach by allowing for a composite alternative hypothesis ′ : RR 1.
This leads to a modified test statistic, where the denominator is still given by the simple likelihood of
the null hypothesis, but the numerator now is given as the maximum likelihood under the composite
alternative hypothesis. The likelihood ratio based test statistic is then

To handle the second of the above restrictions, i.e., the often unknown baseline frequency λ , one
needs access to historical data that were collected before the start of the current surveillance in a cohort
not exposed to the drug of interest. From these data, λ can be estimated and this estimate can be used
in the test statistic via a plug-in approach. While this seems to be reasonable, it inherently creates a
new problem: λ now used in the test statistic is just an estimate, not the real baseline frequency, and as
such it has a variability of its own. If we neglect this variability by simply treating λ as if it was the
real value, we could spoil the results by assigning λ a level of certainty it does not possess.
Li et al. [95] thus introduced the so-called Conditional MaxSPRT (CMaxSPRT). λ and denote

7.2. Application of the SPRT and MaxSPRT
An application of MaxSPRT was presented by Brown et al. [96] who conducted a proof of principle
evaluation. They assessed well-documented risks of several drugs (the NSAIDs celecoxib, rofecoxib,
valdecoxib, the ACE-inhibitor lisinopril and the statin cerivastatin) plus comparator drugs and two
negative controls (cetirizine, clemastine) using data from multiple health plans involved in the
Research Network’s Center for Education and Research on Therapeutics (CERT) [97] of the US
Health Maintenance Organization (HMO). Analyzing data from approximately eight million insurance
members covering a six-year study period, the drug-event associations known from literature were
found for four of five drugs, whereas the negative controls triggered no signal. Brown et al. discussed

Pharmaceutics 2012, 4

631

several methodological problems using healthcare data for signal detection, they endorsed the use of
the MaxSPRT technique in the monitoring of drug safety. Li [98], who also used the CERT data,
assessed the risk of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) after intake of rofecoxib compared to
diclofenac and naproxen using the CSSP method. The obtained results were consistent with those
reported by Brown et al. [96].
Davis et al. [99] applied a SPRT analysis to the Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD) data to assess the
risk of intussusception after rotavirus vaccination and risks for fever, seizures, and other neurologic
adverse events after the change from whole cell diphtheria-tetanus pertussis (DTPw) to a cellular DTP
vaccine (DTPa). They detected an increase in intussusception after 2589 vaccine doses of rotavirus
vaccine, which was an expected signal, and decreases in fever rates, febrile seizures and other
neurologic events with DTPa, where such an association has been suggested by prelicensure trials. The
authors concluded that active and prospective surveillance analysis of VSD data provides a valuable,
population-based early warning system.
Near real-time safety surveillance and sequential analysis were pioneered for and have been mostly
used for vaccine safety surveillance. Yih et al. [100] reviewed a large number of post-market vaccine
safety surveillance studies using the Poisson-based maxSPRT described in Section 7.1 and a
binomial-based maxSPRT (not described in this paper, see [94] for details).
7.3. Further Approaches
Further approaches can be found in the literature as for instance if sequential tests should be applied
on a regular basis, say weekly or monthly, where group sequential testing methods might be more
appropriate as proposed by Li [98] and Li et al. [101].
Hocine et al. [68] presented a sequential case-series analysis, combining the idea of the SPRT with
the SCCS design. They applied the SPRT, implemented as a group sequential test, to the
log-likelihood of the self-controlled case series model.
Furthermore, Jin et al. introduced algorithms that basically strive to rate the “unexpectedness” of an
event [102,103]. Alternative techniques for visual inspection have been suggested in [104–107].
8. Discussion
In this paper, we gave an overview of the process of signal detection, including available data
sources and the preparation of the data, various analysis techniques for SR data, how some of them can
be extended to make beneficial use of additional information available in the data and techniques
specifically developed for longitudinal data. We briefly addressed the adjustment for underlying
confounding as well as the decision making during the triage before presenting methods for
drug surveillance.
Looking back on the past decade, Hauben and Bate [9], Hauben and Norén [108] and Lu [81] stated
unanimously that disproportionality analyses for signal detection purposes are a worthwhile addition to
pharmacovigilance and may be of great value when applied with care, i.e., knowing that the techniques
and the underlying data have their limitations. While the usage of longitudinal data for “classical”
pharmacoepidemiological studies is routine today [38], the usage of such data for pharmacovigilance is
still an emerging field. Impressive amounts of data are potentially available for analysis [21,35,76],

Pharmaceutics 2012, 4

632

and the secondary use of healthcare data for signal detection research is endorsed by many [3,35,109].
It seems plausible to extend the utilization of disproportionality measures from SR to longitudinal data
as a first step. Large-scale databases offer vast amounts of information, which can allow for more
refined analyses, addressing some of the shortcomings of SR data [35]. To apply methods known from
SR data, the longitudinal data need to be transformed to be digestible for the algorithms. As a second
step, methods known from SR data can be modified to take advantage of the longitudinal data structure
directly. Enhancements especially of the Bayesian techniques have been shown to yield results of
higher relevance than the methods for SR data, as indicated by the findings of Schuemie [30] and the
combination of the LGPS and LEOPARD algorithms. However, following the results of
Schuemie et al. [75] and Ryan et al. [76], the techniques that originate from the SR data realm often
fall short compared to the newly developed techniques for longitudinal data, e.g., those developed or
refined in the wake of the OMOP, like ICTPD by Norèn et al. [70] or the application of SCCS or
HDPS in pharmacovigilance [68,77,78].
Madigan and Ryan [109] proposed a set of simple questions, comprising central problems: what
methods should be used to yield the best results, how can disparate data collections be combined
beneficially, when does a signal need to be considered as a risk, what to do with newly identified risks
and how often do the detection methods fail to deliver the correct result? For SR data, some questions
seem to be answered: regarding the choice of methods, the “big four” (namely PRR, ROR, BCPNN,
MGPS) seem to be the dominant data-mining methods, and according to Madigan et al. [40], Bayesian
methods have shown clear advantages when applied to SR data and are the de facto standard for SR
data analysis worldwide today. For drug surveillance, MaxSPRT has gained a lot of attention, as well
as case-only methodology [69]. For signal detection on longitudinal data, it is yet unclear which of the
existing techniques yields the best result, but the findings of Schuemie et al. [75] and Ryan et al. [76]
suggest that the techniques used in the OMOP, like the combination of LGPS and LEOPARD or the
HDPS methodology are likely to provide results of high relevance. However, the methodology for
longitudinal data is still nascent, and according to Madigan and Ryan [109] only extensive empirical
experimentation can bring answers to the question of the optimal analysis strategy.
Although one might state that the applications presented above showed reasonable results, a few
limitations regarding automated analyses should be kept in mind. Generally, Ray [110] claimed that a
high level of awareness for the inherent complexity of the studies and the data is needed. A major issue
arises from the fact that no true gold standard exists to assess the quality of the results obtained from
data-mining analyses [36,80]. One possible way out would be to compare results from a data-mining-study
with those from a pharmacoepidemiological study regarding some well-known safety hazards to assess
the performance of the applied data-mining technique, although this is, of course, no proper validation.
To validate a specific result, the same study could be run on a second database to confirm the first
finding. If, however, several large databases are pooled to detect even rare signals, such a finding
could possibly not be replicated since equally large databases allowing such a study might not be
available [111].
The challenging research field of signal detection comprises many more facets and not all could be
discussed in this paper such as the merging of several databases which requires the development of a
common data model [112], the mapping of terminology from different coding schemes (diagnostic
codes, drug coding, etc.) which needs to be adhered to [21,113], the “innocent bystander” effect [9,45],

Pharmaceutics 2012, 4

633

and last, but not least, data protection issues or other legal questions that may arise when different
databases containing sensitive patient information are combined [16].
