Abstract
Background Several pharmacological agents, such as chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine, have been promoted for COVID19 treatment or pre-exposure prophylaxis. However, no comprehensive evaluation of the safety of these possible agents is
available, and is urgently needed.
Objective The purpose of this study was to investigate the risks of cardiac adverse events associated with the possible pharmacotherapies for COVID-19, including certain antimalarial, antiviral, and antibiotic drugs.
Patients and Methods We conduced retrospective pharmacovigilance analyses of the US Food and Drug Administration
Adverse Event Reporting System database. The reporting odds ratio (ROR), a data mining algorithm commonly used in
pharmacovigilance assessment, was generated to quantify the detection signal of adverse events.
Results Among individuals without coronavirus infection from 2015 Q1 to 2020 Q1, increased risks for cardiac disorders
were found for antiviral agents such as chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine (ROR: 1.68; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.66–1.70),
lopinavir/ritonavir (ROR: 1.52; 95% CI 1.39–1.66), and antibiotics such as azithromycin (ROR: 1.37; 95% CI 1.30–1.44)
and ceftriaxone (ROR: 1.92; 95% CI 1.80–2.05). Increased serious cardiac adverse events, including myocardial infarction,
arrhythmia, and cardiac arrest, were also reported for these drugs. Further analyses of individuals with coronavirus infections
revealed that 40% of individuals receiving chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine reported serious cardiac adverse events. Two
cases resulted in QT prolongations and one case resulted in cardiac arrest. Chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin
contributed to all the QT prolongation and cardiac arrest cases.
Conclusions The current pharmacotherapies for COVID-19 are associated with increased risks of cardiac adverse events.
Variations in the cardiac safety profiles of these pharmacotherapies were also observed. Clinicians should closely monitor
patients with COVID-19, especially those at high risk, using chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin.

1 Introduction
Over five million cases of Coronavirus Disease 2019
(COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) [1], were reported
worldwide as of 21 May, 2020 [2]. A large majority of individuals with COVID-19 have reported experiencing mild-tomoderate symptoms, including fever, cough, and fatigue [3],

Key Points
Chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine may have contributed
to a large proportion of cardiac disorders for COVID-19
treatment or pre-exposure prophylaxis.
The cardiac risks associated with the pharmacotherapies
seem to be further elevated in patients with coronavirus infection, and close monitoring of cardiac risks is
needed.
The potential pharmacotherapies are associated with
serious cardiac adverse events, such as myocardial
infarction, arrhythmia, and cardiac arrest.

most of which do not require medical attention. However,
COVID-19 can cause severe complications or even death in
older adults or high-risk patients with concurrent chronic
diseases [3]. Currently, there is no proven effective treatment
against COVID-19. Infection control measures and supportive care, for example, supplemental oxygen and mechanical
ventilatory support, are the main management strategies recommended by the current COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines
[4]. With the rapid growth of the COVID-19 pandemic, there
is an urgent need to identify existing medications deemed to
be safe and effective with acceptable side effects, to attenuate infections and prevent severe complications in individuals with COVID-19.
Currently, three antiviral drugs—remdesivir, hydroxychloroquine, and chloroquine—have received emergency use
authorization from the US Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) in May 2020 [5]. These three drugs demonstrated
antiviral properties against SARS-CoV-2 in an early in-vitro
study [6]. Chloroquines showed benefits in patients hospitalized with COVID-19, based on two small clinical studies [7, 8]. Thereafter, on 23 March, 2020, the FDA allowed
the emergency use of chloroquines in confirmed COVID-19
cases who were hospitalized. However, more recent research
demonstrated no benefits of using chloroquines in treating
COVID-19 infection [9, 10]. In addition to remdesivir, several antiviral agents such as lopinavir/ritonavir have been
tested while showing uncertain benefits in treating COVID19 [4]. The combined use of antiviral agents and antibiotics,
such as azithromycin and fluoroquinolones, has also been
reported with mixed results.
While COVID-19 is the disease that primarily manifests
in the respiratory system [11], cardiac disorders, such as
coronary artery disease (CAD), heart failure (HF), and cerebrovascular disease, are common in hospitalized individuals with COVID-19 [3]. One potential mechanism is that
myocardial cells have strong receptor angiotensin-converting
enzyme II expression, which could be the target of SARSCoV-2 infection [12]. Other possible explanations include
hypoxia and microthrombi, which cause vascular damage
[13]. Considering the potential cardiac risks associated with
some antiviral agents, however, pharmacotherapy may also
play a role in the elevated risk of cardiac adverse events
(AEs) observed in individuals with COVID-19. For example, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine have long been
proven to increase the risk of torsade de pointes (TdP) and
cause QT prolongation [14], which further increases the
patient’s susceptibility to adverse cardiovascular outcomes
and death during aggressive responses to COVID-19 infections. Risks of ventricular arrhythmia and cardiac arrests are
also complicated by the incremental effects of azithromycin.
After the emergence of severe cardiac AEs associated with
hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine, the FDA cautioned

J. Yuan et al.

against the use of investigational drugs outside the setting
of a health system or clinical trial to avoid possible cardiovascular damage.
With the rapid growth of the COVID-19 pandemic and
current promotion of certain pharmacological agents for
COVID-19 treatments or pre-exposure prophylaxis, evidence
on the cardiac risks of these possible therapies is urgently
needed for clinicians to make informed decisions related to
the benefits and risks of pharmacotherapies [15]. Therefore,
the objective of this study was to investigate the association
between the possible pharmacotherapies for COVID-19 and
the risks of cardiac AEs.

2 Methods
2.1 Study Design and Data Source
We conducted a retrospective pharmacovigilance study
using the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS)
database. The AEs reported for the potential pharmacotherapies for COVID-19 were extracted and queried from the
first quarter of 2015 through the first quarter of 2020. We
included the study period from 2015 and forward because
the goal of the study was to investigate the risks of cardiac
AEs associated with the possible pharmacotherapies for
COVID-19. Therefore, although the medications may not
be used for COVID-19 before the end of 2019, the potential
risks may still be possible for other indications and are worthy of evaluation. In addition, the FAERS data were limited
since the COVID-19 pandemic, therefore, we included data
from 2015 and forwards to evaluate the safety of the therapies. These drugs were commonly used in clinical settings
or under investigation to treat patients with COVID-19 [16].
The FAERS is a post-marketing surveillance system that
collects spontaneous AEs reported directly from consumers, healthcare professionals, pharmaceutical companies,
or others [17]. The database contains nearly 20 million
reports from 1969 to March 2020 [17]. The database contains detailed information on patient demographics, indications, medication use, outcomes, and sources of reports. All
AEs were coded using Preferred Terms (PTs) in the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities terminology [18].
The Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities hierarchy
consists of five levels, from specific to broad categories.
These coded terms are arranged in a hierarchy of five categories. The “System Organ Classes”, grouped by disease
etiology, manifestation site, or purpose, are the high-level
group terms. The PTs, describing the disease symptoms or
diagnosis, an indication, laboratory results, and procedures,
are the low-level group terms and were used in the FAERS
database [18].

Cardiac Adverse Events Associated with Pharmacotherapy Management for COVID-19

2.2 Identification of Exposures

3 Results

We searched the FAERS database to identify reports involving drug generic names, including chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir, ritonavir, ribavirin, umifenovir,
tocilizumab, sarilumab, darunavir, favipiravir, azithromycin, moxifloxacin, ceftriaxone, piperacetazine, tazobactam,
ampicillin, sulbactam, and tobramycin. A clinical pharmacist
also reviewed the medications identified by the search queries. Oseltamivir was not included in the analysis because it
was an investigational drug and not permitted for use outside
of clinical trials. Drugs coded as suspect or concomitant use
were also examined. For AEs reported in the first quarter of
2020, we further limited to those reports with coronavirus
infection, to identify individuals with COVID-19.

3.1 Individuals Without Coronavirus Infection

2.3 Identification of Cardiac Disorder
To search for cardiac-related terms, we used the following
PTs, including myocardial infarction, tachycardia, bradycardia, palpitations, cardiac failure, cardiac arrest, coronary
artery disease, atrial fibrillation, and arrhythmia [19]. To
understand the risks of overall cardiac AEs, we also searched
the PTs listed under the System Organ Class of cardiac disorders in the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities
[18].

2.4 Identification of Coronavirus Infection
To identify patients with COVID-19, we searched reports
involving “coronavirus infection” or “coronavirus test positive”, in the first quarter of 2020. To test this data mining
strategy, we also compared the number of individuals with
coronavirus infection from 2015 Q1 through 2019 Q4. The
number of individuals was fewer than 40. In the first quarter
of 2020, there were 311 individuals with coronavirus infection. Given the substantial increase in the number of infections, most of them should have COVID-19.

2.5 Data Analyses
To evaluate the risk of drug-associated AEs, we calculated
the reporting odds ratio (ROR) [20], the data mining algorithm commonly used in a pharmacovigilance assessment.
The RORs were calculated in the contingency 2 × 2 table, as
described elsewhere [20]. We calculated the ROR for each
drug of interest. If the lower bound of the 95% confidence
interval (CI) of a ROR is greater than the threshold of 1.0,
then the signal of an AE is considered as significant, or the
detected AE is associated with a statistically significantly
higher number of reports following the use of the drug of
interest, compared with those reports following the use of
all other drugs [20].

133

In the FAERS database from 2015 Q1 to 2020 Q1, a total
of 6.12 million reports were identified. The number of
individuals reporting the use of each drug was 347,034 for
chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine, 7506 for lopinavir/ritonavir, 38,810 for ribavirin, 5615 for darunavir, 38,049 for
tocilizumab/sarilumab, 10 for umifenovir, 11 for favipiravir,
26,093 for azithromycin, 8838 for moxifloxacin, 12,595 for
ceftriaxone, 1478 for piperacetazine/tazobactam, 351 for
ampicillin/sulbactam, and 11,456 for tobramycin (Fig. 1a).
Of 6.12 million reports, 288,232 reports of cardiac AEs
were indented. Table 1 compared basic characteristics of
FAERS reports. The total number of cardiac AEs were
24,618 (Fig. 1a, 7.09%) for chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine, 501 (6.67%) for lopinavir/ritonavir, 1311 (3.38%)
for ribavirin, 279 (4.97%) for darunavir, 1683 (4.42%) for
tocilizumab/sarilumab, 2 (20%) for umifenovir, 2 (18.18%)
for favipiravir, 1582 (6.06%) for azithromycin, 839 (9.49%)
for moxifloxacin, 1045 (8.30%) for ceftriaxone, 131 (8.86%)
for piperacetazine/tazobactam, 21 (5.98%) for ampicillin/
sulbactam, and 239 (2.09%) for tobramycin, respectively.
For chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine, the most frequently
reported cardiac AaEs were palpitations (Fig. 2a, n = 3079),
cardiac failure (n = 3129), myocardial infarction [MI] (n =
2964), tachycardia (n = 2859), and atrial fibrillation [AF] (n
= 2441). The RORs (95% CI) associated with chloroquine/
hydroxychloroquine were statistically significant, including 1.68 (1.66–1.70) for overall cardiac disorders, 1.35
(1.28–1.42) for cardiac arrest, 1.45 (1.40–1.50) for MI, 1.73
(1.66–1.80) for tachycardia, 1.77 (1.67–1.87) for arrhythmia, 1.79 (1.70–1.88) for bradycardia, 1.80 (1.73–1.86) for
cardiac failure, and 2.28 (2.05–2.53) for CAD. When chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine concomitantly with azithromycin, the RORs were still significant (Fig. 2b). This finding
was also consistent with previous findings that azithromycin
may be associated with increased cardiac risks [25, 26, 28].
Taken together, close monitoring for QTc prolongation is
necessary for patients who are female, older, have a history of HF, or use chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine with
azithromycin.
As shown in Fig. 2c, the most frequently reported cardiac
AEs for lopinavir/ritonavir were cardiac failure (n = 82),
MI (n = 77), palpitations (n = 56), tachycardia (n = 44),
and AF (n = 44). The significant ROR signals were 1.52
(1.39–1.66) for overall cardiac disorders, 1.70 (1.36–2.13)
for MI, 2.23 (1.63–3.06) for arrhythmia, 2.19 (1.63–2.95)
for bradycardia, 2.09 (1.68–2.60) for cardiac failure,
and 1.57 (1.17–2.11) for AF. The signal for palpitations
was detected for ribavirin (Fig. 2d, ROR = 1.18, 95% CI

MI and CAD were 2.95 (2.42–3.60) and 4.72 (2.79–7.98),
respectively. For tocilizumab/sarilumab (Fig. 2f), the ROR
signal for MI was 1.45 (1.30–1.62). For umifenovir and
favipiravir, the number of events was too small to calculate
RORs. For azithromycin only, the most frequently reported
cardiac AEs were tachycardia (Fig. 2g, n = 212), palpitations (n = 197), AF (n = 172), and cardiac failure (n =
163). The RORs (95% CI) was 1.37 (1.30–1.44) for overall
cardiac disorders, 1.51 (1.26–1.80) for cardiac arrest, 1.64
(1.44–1.88) for tachycardia, 1.45 (1.26–1.67) for palpitations, 1.26 (1.02–1.55) for arrhythmia, 1.51 (1.23–1.86) for
bradycardia, 1.19 (1.02–1.39) for cardiac failure, and 1.77
(1.52–2.06) for CAD, respectively. For ceftriaxone (Fig. 2h),

the significant ROR signals were 1.92 (1.80–2.05) for overall
cardiac disorders, 4.50 (3.88–5.23) for cardiac arrests, 3.43
(2.99–3.93) for tachycardia, 1.39 (1.03–1.90) for arrhythmia, 2.65 (2.15–3.27) for bradycardia, 1.67 (1.38–2.02) for
cardiac failure, and 1.77 (1.42–2.19) for AF, respectively.
For moxifloxacin (Fig. 2i), the RORs (95% CI) were 2.23
(2.08–2.39) for overall cardiac disorders, 1.88 (1.43–2.47)
for cardiac arrest, 2.32 (1.91–2.82) for tachycardia, 3.32
(2.61–4.22) for arrhythmia, 1.52 (1.10–2.11) for bradycardia, 1.86 (1.51–2.30) for cardiac failure, 1.51 (1.15–2.00)
for AF, and 2.56 (1.45–4.52) for CAD. For piperacetazine/
tazobactam (Fig. 2j), the significant ROR signals were 2.06
(1.72–2.47) for overall cardiac disorders, 3.70 (2.29–5.96)
for cardiac arrest, 5.15 (3.71–7.13) for tachycardia, 1.77

(0.84–3.72) for bradycardia, 3.26 (2.20–4.84) for AF, and
4.39 (2.93–6.58) for CAD. The signal for cardiac failure
was detected for ampicillin/sulbactam (Fig. 2k, ROR = 2.74,
95% CI 1.13–6.62).

3.2 Individuals with Coronavirus Infection
During the first quarter of 2020, a total of 311 individuals
with coronavirus infection were identified. The number of
patients reporting the use of the following drugs were 16
for chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine (Fig. 1b), 43 for lopinavir/ritonavir, 7 for ribavirin, 1 for darunavir, 1 for tocilizumab/sarilumab, 7 for umifenovir, 4 for azithromycin, 3
for moxifloxacin, 8 for ceftriaxone, and 2 for tobramycin,
respectively. Among them, six drugs were reported with cardiac AEs, including chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine (n =

5, 31.25%), lopinavir/ritonavir (n = 1, 2.33%), ribavirin (n
= 1, 14.29%), umifenovir (n = 1, 14.29%), azithromycin (n
= 2, 50.00%), and ceftriaxone (n = 1, 12.50%).
Of 311 individuals with coronavirus infections, 26
patients reported cardiac AEs. As shown in Table 1, ten or
38.5% of individuals were dominantly aged under 17 years
(p < 0.001). For chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine, as shown
in Fig. 3a, the most frequently reported cardiac AEs included
cardiac arrest (n = 1), tachycardia (n = 2), and QT prolongation (n = 2). When chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine
was combined with azithromycin, cardiac arrest and QT
prolongation were reported (Fig. 3b). Two cases of QT prolongation were reported for individuals using chloroquine/
hydroxychloroquine.
Cardiac arrest (n = 1) and tachycardia (n = 1) were
reported for azithromycin with strong signals (Fig. 3f). For

and cardiac arrest (Fig. 3g). The signals of cardiac AEs were
not strong for lopinavir/ritonavir (n = 1), ribavirin (n = 1),
and umifenovir (n = 1).

4 Discussion
This study found that the existing potential pharmacotherapies are associated with increased risks of overall cardiac
disorders. We also found that nearly half of the individuals with coronavirus infections reported cardiac disorders
following pharmacotherapies. In particular, chloroquine/
hydroxychloroquine was reported to develop serious cardiac AEs, including tachycardia, cardiac arrest, and QT
prolonged in the overall sample. In addition, individuals
with coronavirus infections had further elevated risks of
cardiac disorders compared with the overall sample. We
also observed variations in the cardiac safety profiles of the
pharmacotherapies available for patients with COVID-19.
Therefore, in clinical practice, clinicians should be aware
of the elevated cardiac AEs in patients with COVID-19 and
weigh up both the benefits and harms of the therapies. Continued pharmacovigilance is needed on cardiac disorders of
other possible pharmacotherapies for COVID-19 to improve
patient health outcomes.
The increased cardiac risks reported in patients with
COVID-19 using chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine and
azithromycin can be explained by drug-induced QTc prolongation, a measure of delayed ventricular repolarization [21].
It can be fatal enough to result in sudden death. Excessive
QTc prolongation with a corrected interval >500 ms can predispose the myocardium to the development of early arrhythmia, which in turn can trigger re-entrant tachycardia as the
deadly Tdp. As a surrogate marker for developing Tdp, QTc
prolongation has been an established side effect of class I
and III anti-arrhythmic medications. This analysis revealed
that azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine were associated
with QT prolongations and cardiac arrest, consistent with
a recent multi-national cohort study, in which chloroquine/

increased risks of arrhythmia-related events such as palpitations, tachycardia, and a further complication of AF. For
antiretrovirals used for COVID-19, most cardiac AEs are
statistically significant in the group of lopinavir/ritonavir,
especially for high-risk individuals with pre-existing cardiac
injury or comorbidities such as HF and prior MI, resulting
in its early stop in 13.8% of patients because of unfavorable reactions. In comparison with lopinavir/ritonavir, other
antiretrovirals are not as prominent while it is important to
weigh the risk-benefit ratio when selecting the best therapy.

137

For instance, darunavir should be avoided in individuals with
a history of CAD or prior MI as it significantly increases the
risks of cardiac deterioration. Selected antibacterial agents
for the treatment of COVID-19 have not shown promising
outcomes but significantly increased risks of developing
unwanted cardiac AEs. These findings strongly suggest
caution in the use of certain medications with respect to
cardiac adverse risks, particularly those patients at a high
risk of cardiac disorders, either for COVID-19 treatment or
pre-exposure prophylaxis.
Frequently used azithromycin and moxifloxacin have
consistently shown increased risks of cardiovascular damage and mortality, especially among elderly individuals with
pneumonia [23]. While beta-lactams such as ceftriaxone and
zosyn cause more harms than benefits in patients who are
more likely to experience tachycardia, and have symptoms of
AF, HF, and cardiac arrest [24]. The risk of developing TdP
is not solely based upon one medication but a cumulative
effect of multiple risk factors such as female sex, increasing
age, genetic disposition, and the use of multiple medications that can prolong QTc intervals, affect the metabolism
of another QTc-prolonging drug, or cause renal/hepatic
dysfunction [25, 26]. Hence, it is important to evaluate the
patient demographic and clinical profile before administering possible pharmacotherapies for COVID-19 to minimize
cardiac disorders.
In addition to drug-induced cardiac AEs, SARS-CoV-2
itself may cause heart inflammation, and is notorious in
worsening pre-existing cardiovascular conditions in patients
with myocarditis, HF, and arrhythmia [11]. Different etiologies of acute cardiac injury resulting from COVID-19
may include right-sided HF secondary to hypoxia-mediated
pulmonary hypertension, worsening of coronary perfusion
due to reduced oxygen-blood saturation, and most severely,
a hyperacute systematic inflammatory response syndrome
like sepsis, especially seen in older patients with multiple
underlying chronic diseases admitted to the intensive care
units. Moreover, a problem concerning potassium levels has
arisen in patients with COVID-19 as a result of the interaction of SARS-CoV2 with the renal artery stenosis system
[27]. Hypokalemia is known to increase the susceptibility
of patients to arrhythmia and heart rhythm irregularities.
Here, we found that chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine was
associated with higher risks of cardiac arrhythmias. Therefore, it is recommended for the management of arrhythmia
to optimize electrolyte concentrations through appropriate
supplementation and fluids, avoiding high-risk medications,
and closely monitoring the electrocardiograms of patients
taking QTc-prolonging agents.

138

This study has some strengths worth mentioning. The
FAERS database includes a large amount of cardiac AEs of
possible pharmacotherapies for COVID-19 reported worldwide. This enables researchers to examine cardiac AEs and
compare to those in patients with COVID-19. This study further provides early signals for health professionals regarding
adverse cardiovascular reactions during the selection of specific medications to be utilized or placed in future guidelines
while ensuring maximal efficacy and patient safety. Onsite
clinical judgment and incorporation of individualized patient
factors are also important for optimizing treatment outcomes
for patients with COVID-19.
This study possesses some limitations that should be
considered. First, most case reports submitted were based
upon personal observations and did not have a commonly
agreed pathological pattern and treatment preference, leading to inconsistent data quality and potentially incomplete
reports with missing information. Second, the reporting to
the FAERS database is voluntary and can be easily biased.
Depending on the variable criteria used for the selection
of events, some cases may not be interpreted as incidence
and can be omitted. Third, the sample size of patients with
COVID-19 was relatively limited owing to the unavailability of the latest data in the FAERS database. Fourth, we
could not exclude the possibility of unmeasured confounding
factors, such as disease severity and coexisting conditions
and complications, which may over- or under-estimate the
association with potential pharmacotherapies and the risk
of cardiac AEs. Hence, further studies are needed to make
a causal link between drug exposure and cardiac AEs. Last,
we cannot exclude the possibility that some patients with
coronavirus infection actually had other conditions, such as
influenza, rather than COVID-19. By comparing the number
of individuals in the previous quarters, more than 90% of
individuals identified in the 2020 Q1 are expected to have
COVID-19.

5 Conclusions
The current pharmacotherapies for COVID-19, particularly
chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin, are associated with increased risks of cardiac AEs. Variations in the
cardiac safety profiles of these pharmacotherapies were also
observed. The choice of pharmacotherapy should be based
on demographic and clinical profiles. Cardiac monitoring
should be employed for patients with COVID-19, especially
those at high risk.
