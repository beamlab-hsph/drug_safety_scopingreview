ABSTRACT
Purpose In post-marketing drug safety surveillance, data mining can potentially detect rare but serious adverse events. Assessing an entire
collection of drug–event pairs is traditionally performed on a predeﬁned level of granularity. It is unknown a priori whether a drug causes a
very speciﬁc or a set of related adverse events, such as mitral valve disorders, all valve disorders, or different types of heart disease. This
methodological paper evaluates the tree-based scan statistic data mining method to enhance drug safety surveillance.
Methods We use a three-million-member electronic health records database from the HMO Research Network. Using the tree-based scan
statistic, we assess the safety of selected antifungal and diabetes drugs, simultaneously evaluating overlapping diagnosis groups at different
granularity levels, adjusting for multiple testing. Expected and observed adverse event counts were adjusted for age, sex, and health plan,
producing a log likelihood ratio test statistic.
Results Out of 732 evaluated disease groupings, 24 were statistically signiﬁcant, divided among 10 non-overlapping disease categories.
Five of the 10 signals are known adverse effects, four are likely due to confounding by indication, while one may warrant further
investigation.
Conclusion The tree-based scan statistic can be successfully applied as a data mining tool in drug safety surveillance using observational
data. The total number of statistical signals was modest and does not imply a causal relationship. Rather, data mining results should be used
to generate candidate drug–event pairs for rigorous epidemiological studies to evaluate the individual and comparative safety proﬁles of
drugs. Copyright © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

INTRODUCTION
The ability to detect unsuspected adverse drug events
is important. Although common adverse events (AEs)
are usually detected during clinical trials, rare but

serious AEs may go undetected because of limited
sample size or because they only affect a subpopulation with limited representation in the clinical trial.
To identify unsuspected AEs, it is important to
conduct post-marketing drug safety surveillance.1–7
Drug and vaccine safety surveillance has traditionally been based on voluntary reports from patients
and health care workers. Statistical data mining methods have successfully been applied on such data.8–12

Increasing availability of large population-based
electronic medical encounter databases that include
denominator information poses both opportunities and
challenges for the drug safety research community. To
date, the use of such data for safety surveillance has
been focused on speciﬁc hypotheses for speciﬁc drug–
event or vaccine–event pairs.4,13,14
One of the most exciting new opportunities in pharmacovigilance is to use electronic longitudinal medical
encounter databases in conjunction with data mining
methods to detect unexpected AEs, without the need
to deﬁne a speciﬁc prior hypothesis. Such methods
could identify potential serious AEs or, equally important, less serious AEs that should be considered as an
important component when evaluating the overall safety
proﬁle and comparative beneﬁt of medical interventions. Assuming sufﬁcient statistical power, safety
surveillance is also important when no AEs are found,
to assure patients that drugs are reasonably safe.
When using data mining methods, it is difﬁcult to
decide a priori what level of speciﬁcity to use for the
AE deﬁnitions. For example, a drug could potentially
cause a speciﬁc form of liver failure, liver failure in general, or a whole range of different types of liver diseases.
In this methodological paper, we evaluate the tree-based
scan statistic data mining method for drug safety
surveillance, a method that was originally applied for
occupational disease surveillance.15 With the tree-based
scan statistic, it is possible to simultaneously evaluate a
large number of potential AEs, as well as grouping of
related AEs, adjusting for multiple testing inherent in
many overlapping groups evaluated.
We illustrate the method using automated electronic
medical encounter data from over three million individuals. We looked for AEs among users of two antifungal drugs, terbinaﬁne and itraconazole, known to cause
liver disease and congestive heart failure, respectively,
and two thiazolidinedione diabetes drugs, pioglitazone
and rosiglitazone, both of which are known to cause
congestive heart failure. These drugs were chosen to
have pairs of related drugs with known AEs and with
different frequency of use, but the choice was otherwise arbitrary.
METHODS
Study population
The study cohort is a sample of health plan members
enrolled during any time from 1999 through 2003 in
one of nine health plans in the HMO Research
Network Center for Education and Research on Therapeutics (HMORN-CERT): Fallon, Group Health,
Harvard Pilgrim, Health Partners, Kaiser Colorado,
Copyright © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Kaiser Northern California, Kaiser Northwest, Kaiser
Southern California, and Lovelace Clinic. Each plan
maintains a database comprised of routinely collected
electronic medical encounter data describing member
demographics, membership, pharmacy dispensings,
and inpatient and outpatient visits. We used data from
approximately 3 417 000 unique members distributed
equally across the nine plans. These data have been
utilized for several drug safety studies.5,16–21 The
HMORN-CERT population, described in detail elsewhere,5,22 is 52% female, 34% under age 24 years,
and 11% above age 65 years.
The demographic ﬁle contains date of birth and
sex. The enrollment ﬁle contains start and stop dates
for health plan enrollment and a drug coverage indicator. We identiﬁed drug exposures from the pharmacy dispensing ﬁle, which includes generic and
brand drug names, dispensing date, national drug
code for drug product dispensed, units dispensed,
and days supplied. The diagnosis ﬁle contains ICD9-CM codes for all diagnoses, date of diagnosis, and
an inpatient/outpatient indicator.
The study was approved by the Institutional Review
Board at each site.
Hierarchical diagnosis tree
As a base, we used all ICD-9 diagnosis codes. From
this base, we removed diagnoses unlikely to be drugrelated acute AEs, such as well care visits, delivery
of a baby, broken legs, ﬂu, and chronic conditions
such as cancer, diabetes, and Alzheimer’s disease.
The remaining ICD-9 diagnosis codes were grouped
using the Multi-level Clinical Classiﬁcations Software
(MLCCS).23
The MLCCS is a hierarchical system with four levels
of clinical concepts denoted by four 2-digit identiﬁers.
The top level MLCCS identiﬁes 18 body systems, and
each of them can have up to three sublevels, as represented by the second, third, and fourth 2-digit codes. A
level may contain multiple ICD-9 codes. Each ICD-9
code belongs to one and only one classiﬁcation group
at each level of the MLCCS system, creating a hierarchical tree structure, where related diagnoses are close to
each other on the tree. For example, “Migraine
(06.05.01),” which consists of 46 different ICD-9 codes,
is a subset of “Headache; Including Migraine (06.05),”
which belongs to “Diseases of the Nervous System and
Sense Organs (06).” After the ICD-9 selection process,
the ﬁnal study version of the MLCCS had 10 groups in
the top level, 33 in the second level, 78 in the third level,
and 72 groups in the fourth most granular level. Ten of
these had only one code immediately below them,

making them identical to the lower level, so there were
183 unique groupings.
Eligible person days
Health plan members who had at least one membership period with drug coverage of greater than
180 days contributed to the analyses. Membership
gaps of 60 days or less were bridged to create continuous membership periods. For analytic simplicity, only
the ﬁrst valid membership period was used. Each person contributed exposed and unexposed days to the
study starting 180 days after the beginning of the study
period (1 January 1999) or 180 days after enrolling in
the health plan, whichever is later. The last contributed
day is the date of the ﬁrst incidence diagnosis, the last
day of enrollment or the last day of the study period
(31 December 2003), whichever comes ﬁrst.
Drug exposure
Contributed days are deﬁned as either exposed or
unexposed to the drug of interest. Exposed time began
on the day after any dispensing of the drug of interest
and continued as long as the member had the drug
available to them, on the basis of days supplied in
the pharmacy ﬁle, plus 6 days extra. Consecutive drug
dispensings were combined and exposure gaps of
6 days or less were considered to represent continuous
drug exposure. Exposure to each drug was calculated
without consideration of prior, concurrent, or future
exposure to any other drugs.
Unexposed person time was deﬁned as all contributed days without exposure to that drug. For each drug
we calculated total exposed and unexposed person
time. All 3.4 million members contributed exposed
and/or unexposed time to each analysis.
Incident outcomes
The previously described 180-day ramp-up period was
used to identify existing conditions. We deﬁned the
incident outcome as the ﬁrst outpatient, inpatient, or
emergency room diagnosis that occurred during a
member’s contributed time, for which there was not
another diagnosis with the same MLCCS code during
the 180-day ramp-up period. If there were more than
one potential incident outcome on the same day, we
selected the one that was less common on the basis
of a population-based diagnosis frequency list. Therefore, each member provided at most one outcome for
the analysis. For example, if an individual has never
had a diagnosis of renal failure and had renal failure
20 days after the beginning of contributing time,

followed by heart failure 2 days later, then only the
renal failure is included in the analysis. This is done
to ensure statistical independence between the observations. Each incident outcome was categorized as
either exposed or unexposed.
Observed and expected counts
For each drug–event pair, the observed count is the
number of incident diagnoses during exposed days.
For the anti-fungal drugs, the expected count is the number of exposed days, times the number of incident diagnoses during unexposed days, divided by the number of
unexposed days. As comparator in the two thiazolidinedione analyses, we identiﬁed members exposed to
glyburide and/or metformin, the most commonly
prescribed diabetes drugs. The expected counts were
then calculated using person days exposed to metformin
and/or glyburide rather than unexposed days.
Using indirect standardization, we adjusted the
expected counts for sex, age, and health plan. Other
potential covariates were not adjusted for, as this
would require a separate set of covariates for each drug
and diagnosis pair. Rather, such covariates should be
adjusted for when evaluating signals that the data
mining methods generate, using traditional pharmacoepidemiological methods.
Tree-based scan statistic
The tree-based scan statistic is a data mining method
that simultaneously looks for excess risk in any of a
large number of individual cells in a database as well
as in groups of closely related cells, adjusting for the
multiple testing inherent in the large number of overlapping groups evaluated.14 It has previously been
applied to occupational disease surveillance. In this
paper, we apply it for the ﬁrst time to drug safety
surveillance. In drug safety surveillance, it is impossible
to know a priori if a drug causes a very speciﬁc problem, such as liver failure, or a more general group of
problems, such as various types of liver diseases. With
the tree-based scan statistic, the surveillance can be
conducted with a minimum of prior assumptions about
the group of AEs that may be caused by the drug.
Described in detail elsewhere,15 here, we only give
a brief overview of the method. All diagnoses are ﬁrst
classiﬁed into a hierarchical tree structure, as shown
in the appendix. For each leaf i of the tree (ﬁnest
granularity), we calculated the observed number ci
as well as the expected number ni of AEs, adjusted
for sex, age, and health P
plan. We also calculate the
total number
of
AEs

The next step is to make cuts on the branches of the
tree. Each cut G deﬁnes a group of nearby and related
leaves, and the sum of the observed and expected number of AEs on these leaves are denoted as cG and nG,
respectively. Note that a single leaf is one potential
cut. If cG/nG > (C  cG)/(N  nG) there is a higher ratio
of observed to expected AEs in the group deﬁned by
cut G compared with the rest of the tree. For each such
cut G, we calculate the log likelihood ratio
 


cG
C  cG
þ ðC  cG Þ log
LLRðGÞ ¼ cG log
nG
N  nG
The cut with the maximum log likelihood ratio is the
most likely cluster of unexplained AEs, and its log
likelihood ratio is the test statistic

the real data set in relation to the log likelihood ratios
from the most likely cuts in the random data sets. In
that way, the method formally adjusts the p-values
for the multiple testing generated by the many overlapping groupings of AEs. This means that, when the
null hypothesis is true, there is a 95% probability that
all p-values are greater than 0.05 or, in other words,
that there is not a single diagnosis or diagnosis group
with p ≤ 0.05.
In addition to the most likely cut, there are other cuts
with more observed AEs than expected. To evaluate
these statistically, they are compared with the most
likely cut in the random data sets, to ensure that such
secondary cuts can reject the null hypothesis on their
own strength when they are statistically signiﬁcant.

As with other scan statistics, the null hypothesis can
be deﬁned either unconditionally or by conditioning
on the total number of AEs observed.24,25 We ran both
types but only report results from the unconditional
analyses. Inference is conducted using Monte Carlo
hypothesis testing,26 calculating the most likely cut
in each random data set. If the likelihood of the most
likely cut in the real data is among the 5% highest of
all the maxima from the real and 99 999 random data
sets generated under the null hypothesis, then that cut
constitutes a signal at the alpha = 0.05 statistical
signiﬁcance level. The Monte Carlo based p-value is
calculated as p = R/(99 999 + 1), where R is the rank
of the log likelihood ratio from the most likely cut in

Results for terbinaﬁne and itraconazole are presented
in Table 1. Out of 183 * 2 = 366 possible cuts on the
tree, 12 have p < 0.05. All are either known AEs (liver
disease,27 allergic reactions,28 and nausea/vomiting29)
or likely due to confounding by indication (skin disorders30,31 and infective arthritis and osteomyelitis32).
Even though we only evaluate incident diagnoses, a
patient may have received the drug for one skin problem and then had another type of skin problem with a
different MLCCS code as their incident diagnosis.
The liver disease (09.08) signal for terbinaﬁne has
14 observed cases, whereas the ﬁner level “other/
unspeciﬁed liver disorders” (09.08.02.04) also has the
same 14 observed cases. Hence, the former signal is
exclusively driven by the latter, and although the latter
would warrant further epidemiological investigation if

it was unexpected, there is no reason to investigate
broader group of liver diseases. Despite a black box
warning, with no observed cases and 0.3 expected, there
was no signal for congestive heart failure during itraconazole use, possibly because of limited exposure in this
cohort.
Results for the two diabetes drugs are presented in
Table 2. There are 12 cuts with p < 0.05. The modest
excess risk for eye disorders (06.07) may be due to
confounding by indication because pioglitazone users,
who are at higher risk for cataract and glaucoma, may
have more severe diabetes.33
Compared with metformin/glyburide users, both
pioglitazone and rosiglitazone users had excess risk
for diseases of the circulatory system (07) and the
heart (07.02) and more than a twofold excess risk for
congestive heart failure (07.02.11). Although the
point estimates are similar for pioglitazone and rosiglitazone, the p-values are larger for the latter as a result
of a smaller sample size of exposed members. From
clinical trials, it is known that pioglitazone and rosiglitazone increase the risk for congestive heart
failure,34,35 so this conﬁrms that the method can ﬁnd
known AEs.
Within the genitourinary system (10), pioglitazone
and rosiglitazone users have a threefold excess risk
of chronic renal failure (10.01.03) and a twofold
excess risk of other and unspeciﬁed diseases of the
kidney and ureters (10.01.06.02), compared with
glyburide and metformin users. This ﬁnding could
warrant further assessment. One possible explanation
is confounding by indication because metformin is
contraindicated for people with renal disorders36.

DISCUSSION
The tree-based scan statistic is proposed as a complement
rather than replacement for other data mining techniques.
Compared with the data mining methods most commonly
used in drug safety surveillance9,37–40, there are three major differences with the tree-based scan statistic. First, the
divergence from the null hypothesis is measured using
the likelihood rather than an observed ratio or a Bayesian
shrinkage estimator. Second, we simultaneously look for
signals at several different levels of granularity. If a drug
causes AEs, it is hard to predict a priori if the AE will
manifest as a very speciﬁc diagnosis, such as liver failure,
or within a range of related diseases such as a variety of
liver problems or digestive diseases. The third difference
is that we formally adjust for the multiple testing caused
by the huge number of overlapping diagnosis groups
evaluated for each drug. Huang et al.41 also use the
likelihood ratio to rank potential clusters, but do not
simultaneously evaluate different levels of granularity.
The purpose of drug safety data mining is to highlight potential problems that warrant thorough investigation. A fundamental principle of data mining is that
an AE “signal” does not necessarily mean that there is
a relationship and a relationship does not necessarily
mean that there is causation. Hence, data mining is
only a ﬁrst step in a drug safety surveillance system.
Because data mining methods are used to simultaneously look at large numbers of drug–event pairs, it
is not possible to consider each pair individually to
properly adjust for all possible confounders. Our
results identiﬁed several statistical signals that clearly
represent confounding by indication. These do not

warrant further investigation. Other signals may merit
further review by a range of assessments including data
checking, sub-analyses by data source or demographics,
temporal scan statistics, logistic regression that incorporate more confounding adjustment, and traditional fullscale pharmacoepidemiological studies.14,42,43
A limitation of this study is the sole focus on acute
AEs. To use the tree-based scan statistic for chronic
events, it is necessary to have longer follow-up of members, registering disease outcomes long after drug use.
Other reasons for false negatives are that the sample size
may be too small for rare AEs, that the AE mostly occur
in individuals that are not part of the study population,
that the AE is not captured by the electronic health data,
that low sensitivity and speciﬁcity of the electronic AE
record reduces the statistical power, or that the excess
risk is hidden by insufﬁcient confounder adjustment.
The latter may occur if, for example, the AE-causing
drug is primarily given to people with low risk of the
AE. Moreover, AEs are unlikely to be found by the
method if they only occur in a small sub-group of all
users, or if it is a drug–drug interaction effect and the interaction drug is only used by a small proportion of the
users of the drug under analysis. Hence, the failure to detect a signal with the tree-based scan statistic should not
necessarily be used as evidence against a suspected AE.
The selection of the diagnosis tree is somewhat arbitrary. The MLCCS tree is based on ICD-9 codes, which
have limitations. For example, different physicians may
classify the same disease condition as different ICD-9
codes. Moreover, if the drug causes two different types
of related AEs in different people but those AEs are
far away from each other on the tree, the method may
possibly detect both problems but will not beneﬁt from
the added statistical power that arise from having them
close to each other on the tree. One can partially
overcome this by using multiple trees, scanning all trees
within the same analysis, but that requires that the AEs
are close on at least one of the trees.15
We limited the analysis to contain at most one diagnosis per individual, to avoid dependency between the
AE counts. This leads to loss of information, and we
may miss AEs, such as heart failure, that are commonly preceded by more acute sequelae. To use such
information, it is necessary to statistically model the
dependency structure in the data, either explicitly or
through the randomization procedure used to generate
the random data sets under the null hypothesis.
For this study, we selected speciﬁc drugs and
scanned for AEs. The method can also be used to scan
a hierarchical tree of drugs for a speciﬁc AE.
In conclusion, the tree-based scan statistic can be
successfully applied as a data mining tool in drug safety

surveillance, simultaneously evaluating small and large
subsets of diagnosis codes and adjusting for multiple
testing inherent in many groupings evaluated.
Several previously known AEs were detected while
the total number of signals was modest. One should
not make any causal conclusions solely on the basis of
the results from the tree-based scan statistic. Rather, data
mining results should be used to generate candidate
drug–event pairs for rigorous epidemiological studies.

KEY POINTS
• Current data mining methods for rare serious
adverse events of pharmaceutical drugs have
limitations, such as the need to a priori specify
the level of granularity of the adverse event
deﬁnitions, using either a smaller or larger group
of related ICD-9 codes.
• Tree-based scan statistic data mining can be used
to detect adverse events with minimal prior
assumptions on the granularity of the adverse event
deﬁnitions, adjusting for the multiple testing inherent in the many overlapping groups evaluated.
• Results of tree-based scan statistic data mining can
be used to generate candidate drug–event pairs for
formal pharmacoepidemiological studies.
