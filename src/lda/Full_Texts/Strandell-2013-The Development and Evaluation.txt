Abstract
Background Around 20 % of all adverse drug reactions
(ADRs) are due to drug interactions. Some of these will
only be detected in the postmarketing setting. Effective
screening in large collections of individual case safety
reports (ICSRs) requires automated triages to identify
signals of adverse drug interactions. Research so far has
focused on statistical measures, but clinical information
and pharmacological characteristics are essential in the
clinical assessment and may be of great value in first-pass
filtering of potential adverse drug interaction signals.
Objective The aim of this study was to develop triages for
adverse drug interaction surveillance, and to evaluate these
prospectively relative to clinical assessment.
Methods A broad set of variables were considered for
inclusion in the triages, including cytochrome P450 (CYP)
activity, explicit suspicions of drug interactions as noted by
the reporter, dose and treatment overlap, and a measure of
interaction disproportionality. Their unique contributions

in predicting signals of adverse drug interactions were
determined through logistic regression. This was based on
the reporting in the WHO global ICSR database, VigiBaseTM, for a set of known adverse drug interactions and
corresponding negative controls. Three triages were
developed, each producing an estimated probability that a
given drug–drug–ADR triplet constitutes an adverse drug
interaction signal. The triages were evaluated against two
separate benchmarks derived from expert clinical assessment: adverse drug interactions known in the literature and
prospective adverse drug interaction signals. For reference,
the triages were compared with disproportionality analysis
alone using the same benchmarks.
Results The following were identified as valuable predictors of adverse drug interaction signals: plausible CYP
metabolism; notes of suspected interaction by the reporter;
and reports of unexpected therapeutic response, altered
therapeutic effect with dose information and altered therapeutic effect when only two drugs had been used. The new
triages identified reporting patterns corresponding to both
prospective signals of adverse drug interactions and
already established ones. They perform better than disproportionality analysis alone relative to both benchmarks.
Conclusions A range of predictors for adverse drug
interaction signals have been identified. They substantially
improve signal detection capacity compared with disproportionality analysis alone. The value of incorporating
clinical and pharmacological information in first-pass
screening is clear.

Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are a major health problem
with dire consequences for patients as well as for society

372

[1–3]. One of several factors that increase the risk of ADRs
are drug–drug interactions [4], which are reported to be
responsible for approximately 20 % of all ADRs [3, 5].
Whereas large collections of individual case safety reports
(ICSRs) are one of the key sources in detection of novel
ADRs related to single drugs, these reports are still an
underutilized source to detect adverse drug interactions
systematically, i.e. drug interactions resulting in ADRs. So
far most of the methodological research on automatic
screening for drug interactions in large report repositories
has focused on purely quantitative measures of disproportionality [6–8], although the individual usefulness of these
measures in detection of novel adverse drug interactions
has not been fully demonstrated. Our previous results
indicate that reported clinical and pharmacological information are other potentially useful components when
screening for adverse drug interactions [9].
Triage algorithms are selection strategies with predefined criteria which aid to focus the analysis of ICSRs on
important associations, i.e. associations that are most likely
to lead to signals [10]. The development of interaction
triages is possibly an important step to facilitate the systematic detection of adverse drug interaction signals in
large collections of reports. Our previous study which
identified variables with potential to highlight adverse drug
interactions early was an important step in this direction
[9]. The aims of this study are (i) to develop triages for
adverse drug interaction surveillance; and (ii) to evaluate
those triages prospectively relative to expert clinical
assessment, including a performance comparison to disproportionality screening.

2 Development of Triage Algorithms
2.1 Methods
Three candidate triage algorithms were developed in a
process combining regression modelling with expert clinical judgement. An overview is provided in the upper panel
of Fig. 1.
2.1.1 Known Adverse Drug Interactions and Drug–Drug–
Adverse Drug Reactions Not Known to Interact
A set of drug–drug–ADR (DDA) triplets was constructed
based on Stockley’s Interaction Alerts [11], a comprehensive international source of drug interaction information.
The set contains 324 DDAs representing known adverse
drug interactions and 6480 DDAs not known to interact,
where the categorization refers to the DDAs’ occurrence in
Stockley’s Interaction Alerts as of the third quarter of 2009
[9]. This set of DDAs provides a basis to identify what

J. Strandell et al.

variables are predictive of subsequent inclusion into
Stockley’s Interaction Alerts, and can therefore be used to
develop triages for prospective identification of adverse
drug interaction signals. For more details on the extraction
of the known adverse drug interactions and the DDAs not
known to interact, see Appendix 1.
2.1.2 Potential Triage Variables
Twenty variables providing clinical, pharmacological or
statistical support of adverse drug interactions were considered as potential components of the triages [7, 9, 12].
The majority of variables correspond to qualitative clinical
information provided on ICSRs, such as a reported explicit
suspicion of a drug–drug interaction; two variables are
pharmacological: both drugs belonging to the same Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) group, and both
drugs displaying activity on a common cytochrome P450
(CYP) enzyme in a way that can lead to an interaction; and
one variable (Omega025 (X025) [ 0) is purely quantitative,
highlighting higher than expected reporting of the DDA
within the ICSR database [7].
Table 1 describes the 20 potential triage variables, which
are all defined on the level of the DDA. While the quantitative and pharmacological variables described above
(18–20 in Table 1) are binary by construction, the clinical
variables (1–17 in Table 1) are defined in terms of the
number of reports on the DDA fulfilling certain criteria. Of
the latter, variables 1–11 require fulfilment of a single criterion, whereas variables 12–17 require multiple criteria.
For example, variable 17 (see Table 1) is defined as the
number of reports fulfilling each of the following three
criteria: solely two drugs listed, overlapping treatment
duration for these two drugs, and a positive dechallenge for
either of the two drugs with the ADR. The multiple-criteria
variables were constructed to identify simultaneous reporting of several clinical aspects suggestive of an adverse drug
interaction, corresponding to unusually strong reports.
2.1.3 Dataset for Derivation of Triages
To construct a dataset suitable for derivation of adverse drug
interaction triages, data on the 20 potential triage variables
was extracted for all included known adverse drug interactions
and DDAs not known to interact. The WHO global ICSR
database, VigiBaseTM, was used as the data source for the
clinical and quantitative variables; ATC information was
gathered from the WHO Collaborating Centre for Drug Statistics Methodology, and the CYP Standardized Drug
Grouping available in WHO Drug Dictionary Enhanced was
used for the CYP variable (for more information, see Table 1).
The reports pooled in VigiBaseTM are collected within the
WHO Programme for International Drug Monitoring [13] and

Fig. 1 Overview of the
processes for development and
evaluation of triages for adverse
drug interaction surveillance
presented in this study. Note
that while we have previously
described how the known
adverse drug interactions and
the DDAs not known to interact
were extracted [9], a summary
of this process is included in
Appendix 1 for completeness.
DDAs drug–drug–adverse drug
reactions

amount to a vast resource of safety information: as of February
2013, VigiBaseTM contained almost 8 million reports forwarded from 111 countries worldwide. In this study, suspected duplicates were removed [14].
For each known adverse drug interaction, the only
VigiBaseTM reports considered were those entered between
1 January 1990 and the quarter prior to inclusion of that
DDA into Stockley’s Interaction Alerts. The purpose was
to mimic the setting for early prospective detection of
adverse drug interactions, by approximating the situation
when currently known adverse drug interactions were still
unknown. Each DDA not known to interact had a corresponding data extraction endpoint, inherited from the
known adverse drug interaction to which it had been

matched (see Appendix 1). The second quarter of 2009 was
the last quarter from which data was extracted from VigiBaseTM for any DDA.
Drugs can be listed as either suspected (S), interacting
(I) or concomitant (C) on reports. When studying adverse
drug interactions, it is not self-evident whether or not the
evaluation of potential triage variables should include
concomitant drugs [12]. Therefore, for variables 1–2 and
4–18 in Table 1, data was extracted from VigiBaseTM
based both on reports where the drug pair was reported as
suspected or interacting (SI) and as suspected, interacting
or concomitant (SIC). Consequently, the dataset contained
37 variables for each included known adverse drug interaction and DDA not known to interact.

Triages for Discovery of Adverse Drug Interactions

2.1.4 Construction of Triages by Regression Modelling
and Manual Modification
Whereas we have previously assessed the potential value of
the variables by considering them one at a time [9], this
study used shrinkage logistic regression to evaluate all
variables simultaneously. In this context, the estimated
regression coefficients determine the variables’ unique
contributions in predicting signals of adverse drug interactions, with positive values strengthening the likelihood of a
signal. The shrinkage employed results in variable selection, as some coefficients are set to zero. For each DDA, the
model yields a predicted probability that this DDA represents an adverse drug interaction. The predicted probabilities can be used to triage a given list of DDAs (see Fig. 2).
Our triage algorithms could include so-called secondorder variables, with the purpose of capturing synergistic
effects. For example, even if each report where the drug pair
is listed as interacting (variable 3) is attributed a certain
reward, and if a common CYP pathway for the two drugs
(variable 20) is attributed another reward, a second-order
variable would allow an additional reward to be given if the
two variables were fulfilled for the same DDA. Based on
clinical considerations on possible synergies in practice,
each of X025 [ 0, ATC and CYP were combined with
variables 1–6 and 12–17, respectively, to form second-order
variables. Furthermore, X025 [ 0 was combined with ATC
and CYP, to yield 96 second-order variables in total.
Three different triages were constructed. The first was
derived by fitting a shrinkage logistic regression model
based on the dataset described in Sect. 2.1.3, using all 37
first-order variables and 96 second-order variables as

Fig. 2 A schematic description of how an already-fitted logistic
regression model can be used to triage DDAs. This imaginary model
contains three integer-valued and two binary predictor variables
depicted with white and grey circles, respectively. The numbers at the
bottom of the circles indicate the variables’ coefficients, and the
numbers in the intersecting areas indicate the coefficients of the
corresponding second-order variables. For each DDA, the coefficients
are multiplied by the values specific to the DDA, and the results are
added to the intercept to yield a sum total, e.g. 0.45 for DDA 1 here.

potential predictors of adverse drug interactions. The
details of the regression modelling are given in Appendix
2. This broad empirical triage was employed primarily as a
basis for identifying a smaller and more coherent set of
promising variables to be considered for the other two
triages, the lean empirical and the lean manual triages. The
variable selection process for the latter two took into
account the estimated coefficients of the broad empirical
triage, as well as subjective clinical considerations. For
example, coherence was sought with respect to including
variables either on SI or SIC level. The lean empirical
triage was then derived through regression modelling in the
exact same way as for the broad empirical triage (see
Appendix 2), but based on this restricted set of potential
predictors. In contrast, the coefficients of the lean manual
triage were manually set, under the restriction that their
absolute values have the same sum as the coefficients of the
lean empirical triage. The elicitation process took into
account the estimated coefficients of the two empirical
triages, but aimed to design a triage as general as possible,
to avoid undue customization to the adverse drug interactions included into Stockley’s Interaction Alerts. While this
source is largely dominated by pharmacokinetic interactions, it has been empirically demonstrated that those
interactions amount to fewer than half of all interactions
reported to VigiBaseTM [15].
2.2 Results
The broad empirical triage is presented in Table 2. In the
regression analysis, 67 variables in total were retained with
non-zero coefficients. The first-order variables that obtained

Each sum total is then transformed to a predicted probability that the
DDA corresponds to an adverse drug interaction signal, using the
formula Pr = ex/(1 ? ex), where x is the sum. The probabilities can
be used to order the DDAs for prioritization, so that in this example
DDA 3 would be assessed first, followed by DDA 1 and DDA 2.
Alternatively, a threshold could be used, and only DDAs with
predicted probabilities above that threshold would be assessed. CYP

24 variables were selected for further consideration.
First-order variables were essentially retained unless they
were negative in the full model. SI was considered the
generally preferred level, with two exceptions: Unexpected

therapeutic response and Solely two drugs. The former is
very rarely reported in VigiBaseTM and did not occur on SI
level for any of the included DDAs; the latter is conceptually stronger on SIC level, as that definition implies that
no additional drugs at all are co-reported, not even drugs
listed as concomitant. Consequently, the multiple-criteria
variable Effect decreased or Effect increased ? Solely two
drugs was also kept on SIC level.

The estimated coefficients of the lean empirical triage
and the elicited coefficients of the lean manual triage for
these 24 variables are displayed in Table 3. The lean
empirical triage places much emphasis on a plausible
pharmacokinetic mechanism through documented effects
on a shared CYP enzyme. This emphasis is reduced in the
lean manual triage, bearing in mind that important tasks in
pharmacovigilance are to detect the unexpected and previously unknown, as well as to detect problems related to
drug usage. Furthermore, the lean manual triage is
designed to reward well-described reports to a greater
extent than the lean empirical triage.

drug interactions was evaluated. Thus, the development
and evaluation phases were securely separated. Two separate benchmarks were used in the evaluation: whether or
not DDAs were adverse drug interactions known in the
literature, and whether or not DDAs corresponded to prospective adverse drug interaction signals according to
expert clinical assessment. Performance was also compared
with that of a triage based only on disproportionality
screening, which represents the current state-of-the-art. An
overview of the evaluation process is provided in the lower

3 Evaluation of Triage Algorithms
3.1 Methods
After completed development, the candidate triages’
respective performance in predicting signals of adverse

The performance evaluation was based on a set of 100
randomly sampled DDAs. To be considered for inclusion,
DDAs had to fulfil the same requirements as the known
adverse drug interactions and DDAs not known to interact
previously extracted from Stockley’s Interaction Alerts
(see Appendix 1). In addition, they were required to have at

380

least one report on SIC level entered into VigiBaseTM
during the most recent year, to focus on DDAs of potential
current interest. For all DDAs in this evaluation set, data
was extracted on the same variables that were previously
used to derive the triages. However, this extraction included VigiBaseTM reports entered up to February 2011. The
three triages were then used to predict the probability of
each DDA being an adverse drug interaction signal. For
more details on the construction of the evaluation set, see
Appendix 3.
3.1.2 Benchmark Classification
All 100 DDAs of the evaluation set were manually classified as already known in the literature, signals or not
signals. This classification formed the basis for the two
benchmarks in the subsequent evaluation of the triages. In
this process, an adverse drug interaction was defined as a
drug–drug pair that increases the risk of an ADR more than
can be expected based on the independent effects of the
two drugs. Relative to the common definition that requires
the effects of one of the drugs to be altered [16], our focus
was broader and included not only pharmacokinetic and
synergistic pharmacodynamic interactions, but also additive pharmacodynamic interactions.
To begin with, one domain expert (JS) reviewed the scientific literature to identify and exclude from further assessment adverse drug interactions established as such in the
literature. For each DDA, drug interactions reference literature [11, 16, 17] and PubMed [18] were reviewed to examine
whether the drug pair is known to interact. Furthermore, the
scientific literature [18–20] was reviewed to determine whether the ADR or a related ADR is listed for the affected drug,
and/or for the drug suspected of inducing the interaction.
The DDAs not classified as already known in the literature were then independently assessed by two domain
experts (JS and IRE) and classified as either signals or not.
In this regard, adverse drug interaction signals were defined
in analogy with the CIOMS signal definition for drug–ADR
pairs [21]. For each DDA, the experts assessed the available reports in VigiBaseTM, as well as complementary
quantitative and pharmacological information (cf. variables
18–20), and other background information. Discordant
classifications were discussed and consensus was reached.
Throughout the entire process the triages’ predicted probabilities of the DDAs corresponding to adverse drug
interactions were unavailable to the assessors.

For a given threshold t, a triage’s sensitivity with respect to the
manual classification into signals and not signals is calculated by
c/(c ? d) and its specificity is calculated by f/(e ? f). With respect to
the classification of the literature status of the drug–drug–adverse
drug reactions, sensitivity is calculated by a/(a ? b) and specificity is
calculated by (d ? f)/(c ? e ? d ? f). By varying t, two complete
ROC curves for the triage are constructed. Good prediction
corresponds to high sensitivity and high specificity. Note that
a ? b ? c ? d ? e ? f = 100

evaluation set. The analysis primarily relied on so-called
receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves, which
display the relation between sensitivity and specificity, for
varying thresholds on the triages’ predicted probabilities.
Because we are mainly interested in predicting adverse
drug interaction signals, analysis was first restricted to the
DDAs not classified as known in the literature, and the
benchmark was defined by the classification of those DDAs
into signals or not signals according to clinical assessment.
As a complementary analysis, the benchmark was defined
by the classification of all 100 DDAs into already known or
not known in the literature. Table 4 explains the calculation of sensitivity and specificity using these two complementary benchmarks.
To date, first-pass screening for adverse drug interactions in ICSR databases is almost exclusively based on
disproportionality analysis. Therefore our triages were
compared with pure disproportionality analysis in an
additional ROC analysis. This was done by considering
X025 as a triage algorithm of its own, and varying its
threshold to generate ROC curves.
Each triage provides its own ranking of the DDAs in the
evaluation set, and discordant results among the various
triages were identified and reviewed. This was done to
complement the high-level ROC analyses. For a given
triage, ranks 1 and 100 correspond to the DDAs most and
least likely, respectively, of being adverse drug interactions. When predicted probabilities were tied among several DDAs, all were assigned the best available rank.

these DDAs did not fulfil any of the variables included in
the two lean triages.
Of the 100 clinically evaluated DDAs, 20 were classified
as already known adverse drug interactions in the literature.
For example, itraconazole – simvastatin – rhabdomyolysis
was classified as already known, since concurrent use of
itraconazole and simvastatin can raise simvastatin levels,
which in turn may increase the risk of myopathy and
rhabdomyolysis [22]. Of the remaining 80 DDAs, 30 were
classified as signals and 50 as not signals. For example, one
of the DDAs classified as signals was warfarin – nystatin –
prothrombin decreased. VigiBaseTM contained 37 reports
on this DDA, for which an interaction was suspected in
four, and in two cases these two drugs were the only
reported. The association was also supported by a recently
published study showing the need to adjust warfarin dosage
under concurrent use with nystatin [23]. Among the DDAs
classified as not signals was ibuprofen – clindamycin – suicide
attempt, where it was clear from the reports that the drugs had
been concurrently used in an attempt to commit suicide.
Among DDAs assessed as signals, the majority resulted
in increased therapeutic effect, although there were
examples of decreased therapeutic effect too. For instance
fluconazole – azithromycin – sinusitis had a total of 27
reports, including two strong cases of drug ineffectiveness.
3.2.2 Evaluation of Performance
Figure 3a displays the performance of the three triages
relative to the clinical assessment of the 80 DDAs in the
evaluation set not found in the literature. The lean manual

and the lean empirical triages dominate the broad empirical
triage, i.e. their curves are consistently above or equal to
that of the broad empirical triage. This implies that at any
given sensitivity, the lean triages perform equal to or better
than the broad triage in terms of specificity. Conversely, for
any given specificity, they yield equal or better sensitivity.
Neither of the two lean triages dominates the other.
The area under the curve (AUC) is a common summary
metric to compare algorithms over all possible thresholds
in ROC analyses. In this study, with clinical assessment as
the benchmark, AUC corresponds to the probability of
ranking a random adverse drug interaction signal higher
than a random non-signal. With this benchmark, the lean
manual, lean empirical and broad empirical triages
obtained AUC values of 0.71, 0.69 and 0.59, respectively.
However, these values offer only rough guidance, since in
routine screening for potential adverse drug interactions,
the higher thresholds are the most relevant: the total list of
DDAs is typically too comprehensive to undergo manual
assessment, and it is reasonable to start with the highest
ranked DDAs. For VigiBaseTM, thresholds corresponding
to specificity below 0.7 are not practically relevant considering their implied workloads, which would be in the
order of 150,000 DDAs. We have refrained from computing partial AUCs, corresponding to thresholds above a
certain limit, to maintain generalizability to databases that
do not match the size of VigiBaseTM.
Figure 3b displays the performance of the three triages
relative to the literature status of all 100 DDAs in the
evaluation dataset. The broad empirical triage performs
slightly better relative to literature status than to clinical

assessment. However, it still has clearly lower AUC than
both of the lean triages, and is dominated by the lean
empirical. The broad empirical triage is not considered
further in this study.
3.2.3 Characterization of Lean Triages
The two lean triages are quite similar in their design (see
Table 3), which is also reflected in the results. For example,
among the ten DDAs ranked highest by the lean manual triage,
six are ranked in the top ten also by the lean empirical triage.
However, for some DDAs they differ considerably, as
reflected by the two examples presented in Tables 5 and 6.
The signal fluconazole – venlafaxine – pneumonia is ranked
12th by the empirical triage but only 31st by the manual triage.
This discrepancy is due to the higher reward given to the CYP
variable in the empirical triage, in particular when combined
with the report where the drugs are listed as interacting. For the
known additive adverse drug interaction glyceryl nitrate –
diltiazem – fall [24], which is ranked 14th by the manual triage
and merely 60th by the empirical triage, the explanation is a
combination of three factors: the absence of a common CYP
pathway, which affects the empirical triage more; the reward
given to disproportionality (X025 [ 0) by the manual triage;
and the higher reward for reported clinical information
directly suggestive of an interaction by the manual triage.
3.2.4 Comparison with Disproportionality Analysis
Figure 4 presents ROC comparisons between the lean
triages and disproportionality analysis. Both relative to

clinical assessment (Fig. 4a) and literature status (Fig. 4b),
the lean triages perform better than X025, the particular
disproportionality metric used for the purpose of this
comparison. This is true in particular around the region of
the natural threshold for X025, zero. At the specificity
obtained by X025 [ 0 with clinical assessment as the
benchmark (0.88), the lean manual and lean empirical
triages yield a sensitivity of 0.40 and 0.48, respectively,
compared with 0.30 for X025. Analogously, at the specificity obtained by X025 [ 0 with literature status as the
benchmark (0.81), the lean manual and lean empirical
triages reach a sensitivity of 0.46 and 0.50, respectively,
compared with 0.25 for X025. The lean triages also outperform X025 overall, as reflected by their higher AUC
values.
To better understand the differences in practice between
the lean triages and disproportionality analysis alone, it is
instructive to study their respective top-ranked DDAs.
Figure 5 displays such a comparison, based on a probability threshold of 0.15 for the lean triages. This threshold
appears to be practically relevant for VigiBaseTM, since it
yields a manageable number of about 14,000 DDAs to
assess during the foreseeable period of a decade. Both
triages highlight 16 DDAs in the evaluation set at this
threshold, so the top 16 DDAs for X025 are shown for
comparison. (Note, however, that X025 highlights 20 DDAs
at its natural threshold zero.) The lean triages display
excellent performance: For the lean manual triage, six of
the 16 DDAs are known in the literature, and eight of the
remaining 10 were classified as signals in the clinical
assessment. The lean empirical triage highlights seven

4 Discussion
We have developed two effective triages for adverse drug
interaction surveillance in large collections of ICSRs. The
proposed triages automate some of the considerations
applied in detailed clinical assessment, and as such use a
much broader range of information than what is customary
in first-pass screening. For example, the triages take into
account whether the drugs are metabolized via the same

DDAs reported as adverse drug interactions in the literature, and seven of the remaining nine were classified as
signals. For X025, 5 of the 16 DDAs are known in the
literature, and 6 were classified as signals. Consequently,
X025 highlighted five non-signals, compared with two each
for the lean triages.
Several adverse drug interactions known in the literature
or classified as signals in the clinical assessment have
negative X025 values but are found among the 16 topranked DDAs by the lean manual and lean empirical
triages. Two of these DDAs, the signal omeprazole – ritonavir/lopinavir – vomiting and the known adverse drug
interaction amiodarone – simvastatin – hepatic function
abnormal, are presented in detail in Tables 7 and 8. It is
clear that the triages have benefited from the strong clinical
and pharmacological information available for these

This DDA was assessed as a signal with one very strong report. The mechanism is likely to be primarily pharmacokinetic: ritonavir inhibits CYP3A4,
which is one of omperazole’s metabolizing enzymes. However, an additive effect cannot be excluded since both ritonavir/lopinavir and omeprazole can
cause vomiting [39, 40]

It is recognized that simvastatin and amiodarone interact to increase the risk of myopathy [41]. Amiodarone is a CYP inhibitor, although it is not known
whether it inhibits simvastatin’s metabolism [16]. Simvastatin can elevate the levels of certain hepatic enzymes [41], and hence this was considered a
known adverse drug interaction
DDA drug-drug-adverse drug reaction, CYP cytochrome P450, MedDRAÒ Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities, S suspected, interacting

CYP enzyme, and if so whether their activity may affect
the metabolism of the other drug involved. They also reward
reporting with strong clinical support of an adverse drug
interaction. In addition to plausible CYP metabolism, the
following were identified as valuable predictors of adverse
drug interaction signals: notes of suspected interaction by the
reporter, reports of unexpected therapeutic response, reports
of altered therapeutic effect with dose information and reports
of altered therapeutic effect when only two drugs had been
used. In our study, the new triages identified reporting patterns
corresponding to both prospective signals of adverse drug
interactions and issues established as such.
The proposed triages produce better predictions in our
study than disproportionality analysis alone, both relative
to what is already known in the literature and relative to
prospective signal detection. The value of the triages is
well illustrated by their high rankings for the signal of
vomiting under concomitant use of omeprazole and ritonavir/lopinavir, and for the known interaction between
amiodarone and simvastatin leading to abnormal hepatic
function. These are DDAs with strong individual reports
that do not stand out in terms of the total numbers, and
thereby are not highlighted with disproportionality analysis. The main limitation of pure disproportionality analysis
is its exclusive reliance on raw numbers of reports. We did
not compare different measures of disproportionality, but

previous studies have indicated that Omega compares
favourably to standard alternatives such as logistic
regression [7], and we expect the added value of our triages
will hold for other measures of disproportionality.
On the whole, the two lean triages yield similar performance for both benchmarks. The ROC analysis appears
to marginally favour the lean empirical triage, although this
depends on what regions of the curves are emphasized.
Conceptually, the main advantage of the lean empirical
triage is that it is data-driven and unlikely to have overfitted to the preferences of JS and IRE who were involved
in the definition of the lean manual triage and responsible
for the clinical assessment in the evaluation phase. The
main advantage of the lean manual triage is that it uses a
broader range of qualitative information on reports,
incorporates disproportionality analysis and relies less
heavily on a known CYP pathway. It is therefore less likely
to have over-fitted to the dominance of pharmacokinetic
interactions in Stockley’s Interaction Alerts, and may be at
an advantage to detect pharmacodynamic interactions. This
is valuable since from our perspective the scope of pharmacovigilance should be to detect any drug combination
with increased risk of ADRs. We made the assumption that
the broad empirical triage may over-fit to the reference set
used in the development phase. This is strongly supported
by our evaluation results.

Triages for Discovery of Adverse Drug Interactions

A strength of our evaluation set is that it provides two
independent benchmarks: one based on what is known in
the literature and one based on clinical assessment. The
analysis relative to clinical assessment is our primary
interest since it reflects whether the data could support a
safety signal, prospectively, and covers any issues with
potential implication to patient safety or public health. In
addition, whereas the literature benchmark will treat any
new signals as false positives, the benchmark based on
clinical assessment focuses exclusively on the unchartered
territory that is the reality of day-to-day pharmacovigilance. On the other hand, clinical assessment is subjective
and a separate set of clinical assessors might have selected
a different set of interaction signals from the same 100
DDAs. In this respect, it is reassuring that the evaluation
against the literature benchmark yields similar results in
our study. As a precaution, our triages were finalized
before anyone had access to the 100 DDAs in the evaluation set. As such, the development and evaluation phases
were clearly separated. Furthermore, the predicted probabilities were blinded and the order of DDAs was randomized to the assessors throughout the complete evaluation
phase.
Our triages produce rankings rather than binary dichotomizations. This is unlike most, if not all, algorithms in
routine use for pair-wise ADR surveillance. One advantage
is that this allows clinical assessors to start with the DDAs
most likely to represent true adverse drug interactions.
Should a binary dichotomization be preferred, it is possible
to threshold the interaction triage score at an appropriate
level. As an illustration, at a threshold of 0.15 predicted
probability (that the suspected adverse drug interaction
would be reported in the literature in the near future), both
lean triages would highlight around 14,000 DDAs in VigiBaseTM as suspected adverse drug interactions. In our
evaluation set, 16 DDAs met this threshold for each triage.
Six or seven (38–44 %) of those were identified as adverse
drug interactions known in the literature and seven or eight
of the remaining DDAs (78–80 %) were classified as signals worthy of further follow-up. In pair-wise drug-ADR
surveillance in VigiBaseTM, around half of the associations
in first-pass screening relate to already known ADRs, and
among the other half, around 20 % are sent out for clinical
assessment. The high proportion of signals in our study
suggests excellent performance, but it should be regarded
in the light of being based on quite a small sample of
DDAs, and also that it may be favoured by the use of a fairly
conservative threshold. Furthermore, the more limited understanding and documentation of clinically relevant interactions
can be expected to yield a lower proportion of already unknown
causal associations in interaction surveillance.
Drug interactions of clinical importance are likely
to increase the risk for a spectrum of adverse reactions.

385

We have evaluated adverse drug interaction surveillance at
the level of specific ADRs rather than for pairs of drugs in
general. The latter is an interesting topic for future
research. It may be particularly valuable for rare drugs and
in smaller databases. Most of the triage variables that we
have identified are directly applicable to an analysis at the
level of drug pairs, without a link to a specific ADR. The
main challenge would be to adapt disproportionality analysis to this setting.
As far as we are aware, this is the first application of
predictive regression models for first-pass screening of
large collections of ICSRs. We opted for lasso shrinkage
logistic regression, which was of significant help in the
process of reducing the number of potential predictor
variables. During the course of this work we have been
made aware of interesting recent developments within this
methodology. These should be considered in future work
and include the possibility to constrain the regression
modelling to non-negative coefficients only, and to determine their confidence intervals [25].
Our triages are not a perfect safety net to detect all signals of suspected adverse drug interactions. In our evaluation set, three DDAs clinically assessed as signals received
the lowest possible score by both lean triages, i.e. these
DDAs did not fulfil any of the variables included into these
two triages. Still, for some of these DDAs there were reports
with supportive information such as positive dechallenge or
dose information. This emphasizes the importance of future
work in this area, in particular as regards the ascertainment
of additional predictors of suspected adverse drug interactions at the level of individual reports.
Collections of ICSRs suffer from well-known limitations, e.g. extensive and variable underreporting [12]. This
may distort aggregated analyses such as our triages, and
potential findings from automated screening should always
be followed by detailed clinical assessment of the reports.

5 Conclusions
The value of incorporating clinical and pharmacological
information in triages for first-pass screening for signals of
adverse drug interactions is clear. The proposed triages
clearly outperform pure disproportionality analysis. Plausible CYP metabolism, reporter notes of suspected interaction, and unexpected therapeutic response or altered
therapeutic effect with dose information or solely two
reported drugs were identified as valuable predictors of
adverse drug interaction signals.

Appendix 1: Extraction of Known Adverse Drug
Interactions and Drug–Drug–Adverse Drug Reactions
(DDAs) not Known to Interact
We have previously described in detail how a reference set
of known adverse drug interactions and DDAs not known
to interact was constructed based on Stockley’s Interaction
Alerts [9]. The main steps are repeated here.
Stockley’s Interaction Alerts [11] is an electronic quick
ready-reference with information on more than 40,000
drug–drug, drug–alcohol and drug–food pairs. It is one
component of Stockley’s Drug Interactions [16], a wellrenowned international drug interaction reference. Among
other things, its textual descriptions list adverse drug
reactions (ADRs) that might result from the drug
interactions.
For drug pairs entered between the first quarter of 2007
and the third quarter of 2009, the drug names were matched
to substances in the WHO Drug Dictionary Enhanced [13],
and pairs where either drug was ethanol or nicotine were
excluded. From each free text description, WHO Adverse
Reaction Terminology (WHO-ART) preferred terms [13]
were extracted using a customized algorithm [9, 26], and
were then combined with the drug pair to form DDAs. For
each DDA, a note was made of the quarter when it was first
included into Stockley’s Interaction Alerts.
Any DDA was excluded if its ADR was part of a variable to be tested for inclusion into the triages (see the
definitions of variables 1, 2, and 6 in Table 1). Furthermore, any DDA was excluded that did not fulfil basic
reporting requirements into the WHO global individual
case safety report database, VigiBaseTM [13], which is the
main data source in this study: After removal of suspected
duplicates [14], at least three reports were required where
the two drugs were listed as suspected, interacting, or
concomitant, entered between 1 January 1990 and the
quarter prior to inclusion of the DDA into Stockley’s
Interaction Alerts; and at least one report was required with
both drugs listed as suspected or interacting, in that same
time period. Finally, for the remaining DDAs, the extracted
ADRs were manually validated against the source text, and
false hits were removed.

J. Strandell et al.

This yielded 324 known adverse drug interactions. The
previously reported number, 322 [9], excludes two DDAs
that fulfilled the reporting requirements in the quarter prior
to inclusion into Stockley’s Interaction Alerts, but not at
the database end date.
The reference set was completed by including a comparison group of DDAs not known to interact. All drugs in
Stockley’s Interaction Alerts were paired, and those pairs
that were actually listed were excluded. Thereafter the
remaining pairs were combined with all ADR terms
extracted from Stockley’s Interaction Alerts in the identification of known adverse drug interactions, thus forming
a new group of DDAs. From this group, DDAs with certain drugs or ADRs were excluded, as described above for
the known adverse drug interactions. For the remaining
DDAs, it was identified for what quarters they fulfilled the
VigiBaseTM reporting requirements used for the known
adverse drug interactions. Finally, 20 DDAs not known to
interact were randomly chosen for each known adverse drug
interaction, matched on quarter of data extraction. (The same
DDA could not be selected for multiple quarters.)

Appendix 2: Regression Modelling
For the purpose of empirically deriving triages, lasso
logistic regression was used. The lasso shrinkage restricts
the coefficients so that the sum of their absolute values
cannot exceed a predefined limit [27]. This reduces the risk
of over-fitting to the available dataset, which in turn should
yield better predictive performance on new data. At the
same time, the lasso performs model selection by setting
some coefficients to exactly zero, i.e. it allows only the best
predictive variables into the model. Shrinkage regression of
this type has grown in usage over recent years, and has
been repeatedly and successfully applied in the medical
domain [28, 29]. We used the implementation of lasso
logistic regression provided by Friedman et al. [30].
Prior to model fitting, all variables were standardized to
have unit variance. However, all coefficients presented (see
Tables 2, 3) have been transformed back, and should be
applied to the variables’ respective original scales.
The standard approach of five-fold cross-validation was
used to select the appropriate level of shrinkage [31]. Predictive performance was measured in terms of mean squared
error [32]. Once the optimal amount of shrinkage had been
determined, the entire data set was used to fit a single model.

Appendix 3: Construction of the Evaluation Set
Because clinical assessment is tedious, the size of the
evaluation set was limited to 100 DDAs. To make the

Triages for Discovery of Adverse Drug Interactions

evaluation as informative as possible, it was important to
ensure coverage of likely interaction signals as well as
unlikely ones. To this end, the random selection of DDAs
into the evaluation set was stratified according to the predicted probabilities of the two lean triages. Creating strata
by simply dividing the 0–1 interval into equally spaced
pieces would yield disproportionately many DDAs with
high probabilities, since the distribution of DDAs is heavily
skewed towards zero. At the same time, to stratify
according to the cumulative distribution of predicted
probabilities would yield unsatisfactorily many DDAs with
the lowest possible probability, since those DDAs amount
to more than 70 % of all included DDAs. We used an
intermediate alternative, whereby each stratum was created
by incrementally increasing its upper limit. A stratum was
considered complete as soon as it was filled up by more
DDAs than its specific target size, which was computed as
the ratio between the remaining number of DDAs and the
remaining number of strata.
