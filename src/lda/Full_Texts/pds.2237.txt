ABSTRACT
Purpose To detect the signals of celecoxib compared with other analgesics and anti-inﬂammatory drugs (AAIDs) by proportional
claims ratio (PCR), claims odds ratio (COR), information component (IC), and relative risk (RR) using the Korean claims database.
In addition, the concordance of the identiﬁed signals by the data-mining indices (DMIs) and the validity of the DMIs were
evaluated.
Methods The Korean Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service claims database was used. The study population consisted of
elderly ambulatory care patients with osteoarthritis who were prescribed AAIDs in Seoul from 1 January 2005 to 30 September 2005. A
short-term serious adverse event (SAE) was deﬁned as a hospital admission within 12 weeks from each AAID prescription. Among the
screened SAEs, signals were identiﬁed by the DMIs. The sensitivity, speciﬁcity, and predictability were estimated with reference to known
adverse events associated with celecoxib.
Results A total of 135 232 elderly patients with osteoarthritis were prescribed AAIDs. There were 309 717 drug–SAE pairs and 481
different SAEs. The PCR, COR, IC, and RR detected were as follows: 56 (11.6%), 57 (11.9%), 129 (26.8%), and 123 (25.6%) signals
for celecoxib, respectively. The RR detected signals had a relatively high sensitivity (23.4%) compared with the other indices (PCR
9.9%, COR 10.8%, and IC 18.9%). The speciﬁcity of RR (73.8%) was higher than that of IC (70.8%). The positive and negative predictive
values of the RR were 21.1% and 76.3%, respectively.
Conclusion This study suggested that the RR was the most accurate of the DMIs for detecting signals in the claims database. Copyright ©

BACKGROUND
The detection of signals is important in monitoring
the safety of marketed products. Several data-mining
indices (DMIs) based on the disproportionality of
adverse event (AE) reporting have been used to detect
signals in spontaneous reporting databases.1 The

commonly used methods described in the majority of
published papers include the proportional reporting ratio
(PRR),2 reporting odds ratio (ROR),3 and information
component (IC) calculated by the Bayesian conﬁdence
propagation neural network (BCPNN) method.4 These
approaches compare the observed counts of drug–
event combinations with the expected counts based
on the relative frequency of events occurring for
the drug alone and the event alone.5,6 The DMIs
have been developed almost simultaneously; however,
they have been applied independently to different
spontaneous AE databases.

validation of data-mining index

Spontaneous reporting databases are generally considered useful data sources for identifying unknown
or rare adverse drug reactions (ADRs).4,6–8 In contrast
to spontaneous reporting databases, large healthcare
administrative databases contain information on the
denominator as well as the numerator, which could
provide more useful information on real-world unrecognized or underappreciated drug AEs.8–10 The
number of spontaneous reports has, in general,
been low in Korea compared with other developed
countries.11 Data-mining using the Korean Health
Insurance Review and Assessment Service (HIRA)
database might substantially aid effective surveillance
of ADRs in Korea. In response to recent suggestions
for the development of an active drug monitoring system using the Korean health insurance claims database, a novel DMI was developed based on the
relative risk (RR) of information obtained from the
HIRA database.12
Celecoxib is a non-steroidal anti-inﬂammatory drug
(NSAID) used for the relief of acute and chronic
pain13 developed to minimize the gastrointestinal
AEs of conventional NSAIDs. However, the possibility of an increased risk for heart attack and stroke continues to be a concern in users of NSAIDs, particularly
COX-2 selective inhibitors such as celecoxib. The
COX-2 inhibitor, rofecoxib (VioxxW, Merck & Co.
New Jersey), was withdrawn from the market in
2004 for such concerns.14,15 Celecoxib has been associated with an increased risk of gastrointestinal ulcer
complications including bleeding and perforation.
Thus, celecoxib should be evaluated for its absolute
safety as well as relative safety compared with other
drugs in the same therapeutic class.16 In Korea, celecoxib
is a prescription-only drug. All of the information of
celecoxib prescription has been collected in the
Korean national health insurance claims database. Therefore, in this study, celecoxib was selected as the target
drug for signal detection and validation of DMIs.
Few prior studies have examined the concordance of
several DMIs in spontaneous reporting databases.17–20
However, speciﬁc DMIs are thought to be superior in
certain situations but inferior in others. None of the proposed DMIs have proved to be ideal tools for detecting
signals using a health insurance claims database.
The goal of this study was to examine the signals
detected for celecoxib compared with other analgesics
and anti-inﬂammatory drugs (AAIDs) using a novel
DMI, RR, as well as other DMIs including proportional claims ratio (PCR), claims odds ratio (COR),
and IC with information from the Korean national
health insurance claims database. In addition, we evaluated the concordance of the signals indentiﬁed by the

various DMIs and the validity of the DMIs using the
labeled AEs of celecoxib as the reference.
METHODS
Data source
The HIRA is a non-proﬁt agency responsible for reviewing medical fees, assessing the quality of healthcare
institutions, and evaluating whether certain health care
services are medically necessary and delivered at an
appropriate level and cost. All Koreans are entitled to
be either an ‘employed member’ or a ‘community member’ under the national health insurance system. When a
patient demonstrates signs and/or symptoms indicating a
need for medical care, they are provided with regional
medical services. The providers then submit claims to
the HIRA for a review of the incurred medical costs.
Therefore, the HIRA database contains all information
on claims made, as well as on prescriptions for approximately 50 million Koreans.21
The HIRA data for elderly patients (65 years or
older) submitted by healthcare providers in Seoul
between 1 January 2005 and 31 December 2005 were
used for this study. Seoul is the capital and largest city
of South Korea. A megacity with a population of over
12 million, it is one of the largest cities in the world.
The database contained information on 1 093 262
elderly patients and 11 842 586 prescriptions.12 This
study was exempt from review by the institutional
review board of the Seoul National University College
of Medicine as the researchers only accessed a
de-identiﬁed database, which included age, gender,
diagnosis, and a list of medications prescribed.12
Drug information in this database included brand
name, generic name, prescription date, duration, and
route of administration. Diagnoses were coded using
the International Classiﬁcation of Disease, Tenth Revision (ICD-10). In Korea, physicians are required to
report the diagnostic code in accordance with the
ICD-10 coding system when completing medical care
cost statements to submit to the national insurance
system.
Study subjects
The study population consisted of elderly ambulatory
care patients with osteoarthritis (ICD-10 M15 ~ M19)
from Seoul who had oral AAIDs prescribed to them
from 1 January 2005 to 30 September 2005. The
medications were classiﬁed according to a system used
by the Korean Ministry of Health and Welfare
(MOWH). The AAIDs (MOWH code 114) include celecoxib, aspirin, acetaminophen, diclofenac, ibuprofen,

Deﬁnitions of drug exposure and drug–serious
adverse event pairs
Celecoxib was selected as the target drug for detecting
signals, with the other oral AAIDs serving as a reference group. A short-term SAE was deﬁned as a hospital admission within 12 weeks from the prescribed date
of celecoxib or other AAIDs during the study period of
1 January 2005 to 31 December 2005. Short-term

SAEs were identiﬁed from the study population database and diagnoses (three-digit ICD-10 code) at the
time of hospitalization. We deﬁned the admission
diagnosis as the one main diagnosis and two subdiagnoses from the relevant claims data. Prescription
claims that included celecoxib in addition to other
AAIDs during the study period were assigned to both
celecoxib and other AAIDs claims for analysis. The
number of AAIDs prescriptions presented was the
total number of AAIDs prescriptions for all osteoarthritis patients during the study period. A 12-week
interval was chosen for the detection of relatively
short-term signals associated with AEs. Drug–SAE
pairs, consisting of the prescribed celecoxib and one
of the admission diagnostic codes were generated for
each prescription. Therefore, one SAE could be
counted a multiple of times depending on the number
of AAIDs prescribed per patient. Figure 1 presents a
conceptual ﬁgure describing the process of generating
drug–SAE pairs.
Data-mining indices
The three DMIs commonly used—PRR, ROR, and
IC—were calculated and compared with the reference,
RR. The PRR and ROR were used for the claims database instead of the spontaneous reporting database,
and the indices are referred to as PCR and COR,
respectively. Two-by-three tables were constructed
by combining the frequency of drug–SAE pairs and
total claims with the estimated indices for each SAE
(Table 1). When considering a celecoxib and a speciﬁc
SAE combination in the claims database, a framework
could be constructed providing the number of claims
with the combination of interest. The PCR, COR, IC,
and RR were calculated for all combinations as seen
in Table 1.17 Table 2 shows the information used to
support the calculations. Four methods were applied
using each criterion for signal detection. Original

criteria, introduced for the ﬁrst time with the index,
were chosen for signal detection in this study. The
methods included PCR, COR, and IC, with the criteria
consisting of “PCR ≥ 2, A ≥ 3, and chi-squared ≥ 4”;
“COR ≥ 2, A ≥ 3, and chi-squared ≥ 4”; and “the
lower limit of IC’s 95%CI ≥ 0,” respectively.2–4,6
The RR was computed by dividing the proportion of
celecoxib-speciﬁc SAE pairs (A) and the total number
of celecoxib’s claims (T1) by the proportion of other
AAIDs SAE pairs (C) and the total number of claims
of other AAIDs (T0). The SAE was deﬁned as a signal
for celecoxib when the lower limit of the RR’s 95%CI
was greater than 1 (Table 2).
Comparison and validation of data-mining indices
The screened short-term SAEs were reviewed if they
were identiﬁed as AEs associated with celecoxib.
The list of AEs used included the label celecoxib
(CelebrexW, Pﬁzer, New York City) as of 26 February
2007 updated as the reference source of known
AEs.22 Three clinicians independently and blindly
compared the screened SAEs and the list of known
AEs. They were offered only the list of SAEs as
ICD-10 codes with the names of the diseases and the
list of known celecoxib AEs without the information
on detected signals. The sheets were delivered separately to the evaluators, and they were asked to compare
the SAEs and the list of known AEs independently. All
screened short-term SAEs were reviewed to determine
whether the signals were identical to the known AEs

or whether they were symptomatically related to the
known AEs.12 In addition, before the intra-class
correlation coefﬁcient values were calculated, the evaluators were unaware of each other’s results.
Inter-observer reliability demonstrated good agreement with an intra-class correlation of 0.70 (95%CI
0.65–0.74) for the three evaluators, and all disagreements were resolved by consensus.
The signal detection sensitivity (the ability to detect
a signal) was then calculated, as well as the speciﬁcity
(the ability to detect a non-signal), the positive predictive value (PPV; the proportion of the known signals
that were detected signals), and the negative predictive
value (NPV; the proportion of the unknown signals
that were undetected signals) for the four indices.
The sensitivity was calculated as a / (a + c), speciﬁcity
as d / (b + d), PPV as a / (a + b), and NPV as d / (c + d),
where a represents a known detected signal, b represents a false-positive detection, c represents a falsenegative detection, and d represents an unknown
undetected signal (Table 3). All analyses were performed using the SAS statistical program (Release
9.1, SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC.,USA).
RESULTS
A total of 153 232 elderly ambulatory care patients
with osteoarthritis who had received AAID prescriptions in Seoul between 1 January 2005 and 30 September
2005 were identiﬁed in the HIRA database. Of these,
25 691 were admitted to hospitals. The number of
AAID prescriptions administered to these patients was
1 618 232. In total, 309 717 AAID-SAE pairs were
found, including 29 320 (9.5%) celecoxib-SAEs. There
were a total of 481 different short-term SAEs as screened
signals.
Table 4 shows the proportion of the screened shortterm SAEs for which the signaling criteria was satisﬁed by each index. With the PCR, COR, IC, and
RR, 56 (11.6%), 57 (11.9%), 129 (26.8%), and 123
(25.6%) SAEs were detected as signals for celecoxib,
respectively. The number of detected and undetected
signals for celecoxib was described by the RR based

on the labeled AEs, listed by disease category, as
shown in Table 5. When the detected and undetected
signals by the RR were compared with the known
AEs associated with celecoxib, 21.1% (26/123) and
23.7% (85/358) of the signals were found to correspond, respectively. The most frequently screened
short-term SAEs according to ICD-10 codes were diseases related to the musculoskeletal system (51 SAEs,
10.6%), circulatory system (50 SAEs, 10.4%), injury
or poisoning (44 SAEs, 9.1%), neoplasms (44 SAEs,
9.1%), and digestive system (43 SAEs, 9.0%). Diseases related to the digestive system (5 signals,
19.2%) were the most commonly observed labeled
signals detected by the RR.
The RR-detected signals had a relatively high sensitivity (23.4%) compared with the other indices (PCR
9.9%, COR 10.8%, and IC 18.9%). The speciﬁcity of
RR (73.8%) was higher than that of IC (70.8%) but
lower than that of PCR and COR (87.8%). The PPV
and NPV of the RR were 21.1% and 76.3%, respectively (Table 6).
DISCUSSION
Signals for celecoxib compared with other AAIDs
were identiﬁed by applying the PCR, COR, IC, and
RR to the Korean national health insurance claims
database. The RR had higher sensitivity and PPV
for the detection of labeled SAEs compared with
the other proposed indices. A high-sensitivity DMI
could be useful in detecting signals leading to many
timely alerts. Accordingly, the RR might be an optimal choice for detecting signals in the Korean
HIRA database. The results of this study suggest
that a DMI RR could be used to identify drug
safety signals in other large health insurance claims
databases.
The DMIs (PCR, COR, and IC) are similar in principle. They search databases for disproportionality.6,23
The logic of signal detection using the PCR or COR
is that the expected ratio or odds, respectively, for a
speciﬁc SAE was noted after prescribing celecoxib,

and then they were compared with the observed ratio
or odds associated with AAIDs prescriptions. For the
BCPNN, the overall probability (prior probability) that
a speciﬁc SAE was expected to be on a claim for
AAIDs was compared with the conditional probability
(posterior probability) of that particular SAE being
present, given the information that celecoxib was actually included. IC is expressed as the logarithm to the
base 2 of the ratio of the observed to expected counts
of claims.4,18 However, the RR was the ratio of the
proportion of SAEs among the celecoxib claims compared with the AAIDs claims. The RR uses the total
number of actual drug prescriptions from the national
claims database as the denominator, and therefore, this
information reﬂects real-world data.12 In this study, in
contrast to the spontaneous ADR reporting database,
the Korean national health insurance HIRA database
does not rely on reported AEs. This provides the
possibility of detecting formerly unrecognized or
under-reported AEs. Moreover, to focus on identiﬁable serious events, potential SAEs of drugs were
deﬁned as events requiring hospitalization. Because
the degree of severity of the AE was considered,
clinically signiﬁcant AEs warranting hospitalization
could be given priority status in a drug safety surveillance system.12
In this study, although well-known signals related to
gastrointestinal and cardiovascular AEs associated
with celecoxib were detected as signals, the most
frequently detected signals were related to disorders
of the musculoskeletal system and connective tissue.
Although these signals might reﬂect real signals associated with celecoxib, there also might be a bias by the
confounding effect of indications for or contraindications to celecoxib. For example, if celecoxib was the
preferred medication for elderly patients with osteoarthritis compared with other AAIDs, musculoskeletal
disorders, such as osteoarthritis, would be detected as
a signal. In addition, among the elderly requiring pain
relief for osteoarthritis, celecoxib was given to those at
high risk for gastrointestinal events. Consequently, the
data-mining results should be interpreted cautiously in
accordance with the deﬁnition of the study patients,
study drug, and reference drugs. Conventional pharmacoepidemiological studies aim to reveal unbiased
relationships between drug exposure and outcome.
Therefore, biases including confounding by indications for and/or contraindications to the medication
might be removed by carefully adjusting for the confounders according to a speciﬁc study hypothesis.
However, signal detection by data-mining is used to
identify unknown AEs by unspeciﬁed drugs. Although
data-mining is a useful tool for pharmacovigilance,

associations between the detected signals and the
targeted drugs require further study to determine
whether the relationship is indeed causal. There is a
need to develop universally applicable DMIs for automated ﬁltering of signals that consider potential
confounding by indications, as well as severity of
disease, co-morbidities, and drug–drug interactions.
This study has several strengths. First, a large national health insurance claims database was used to
detect the signals associated with celecoxib. This database includes comprehensive information on more
than one million elderly patients in Seoul, the capital
of South Korea. This database also provides an actual
denominator for the drug prescriptions, in contrast to
the use of spontaneous ADR reporting databases
where the lack of a denominator is a fundamental
problem.12 Second, the concordance of detected
signals identiﬁed by several DMIs was examined. In
addition, we attempted to validate commonly available
DMIs by calculating the sensitivity, speciﬁcity, PPV,
and NPV. Third, only elderly patients were included
to avoid the confounding effect of age with detecting
the signals. Fourth, instead of including all prescribed
drugs, only AAIDs were selected as reference drugs to
minimize bias associated with medication indications
and to ensure the comparability of the SAEs between
the targeted celecoxib users and controls.
The limitations of this study included the following.
Although the RR showed a relatively high sensitivity
compared with other indices, the accuracy of all of
the data-mining methods used in this study were low
and not satisfactory. There are several reasons for this.
First, as there is no gold standard for evaluating the
accuracy of DMIs,5 the known AEs of celecoxib were
used as surrogate markers for a gold standard. Although SAEs associated with celecoxib were intended
to be detected, all known AEs were used as a reference, rather than only SAEs. Therefore, unfortunately,
the lack of an objective measure of “serious” AEs
creates a discrepancy between the detected signals
(SAE) and the reference list of concordant AEs, which

includes the entire clinical spectrum of AEs regardless
of severity. Second, the SAEs were deﬁned according
to the ICD-10 diagnostic codes, which differ from
other AE reporting systems, such as the WHO
Adverse Reaction Terminology, with regard to vocabulary, classiﬁcation, and nomenclature. Third, although the overall agreement of the evaluation
results was good, it is possible that the clinicians evaluated the screened SAEs against the list of known AEs
subjectively and/or arbitrarily. Moreover, several earlier studies expressed the level of concordance of the
DMIs with the IC of the BCPNN method used as the
reference standard;17–20 they demonstrated that all
the applied DMIs were broadly comparable, despite
the similarity of basic characteristics in each index.
However, the performance with regard to signal detection was somewhat different. The results of this study
are consistent with these prior results. Therefore, although the four different DMIs used to detect possible
signals are, in principle, similar, the similarity of the
methods in terms of the basic ideas does not necessarily mean that the pattern of possible signals is the same
among the DMIs.18 In this study, agreement was
excellent between the PCR and COR (kappa was
0.99), and it was good between the IC and RR (kappa
was 0.74). However, agreement was not good for the
other combinations, the values of kappa being approximately 0.50. These results suggest that signaling criteria are substantially different. The IC or RR were more
like one-sided tests associated with a more sensitive
and less speciﬁc DMI compared with the PCR or
COR, which were more like two-sided tests. Having
used a one-sided interval, we expected the DMI to be
more sensitive and less speciﬁc compared with others
using two-sided tests. When examining the drug safety
DMI, the sensitivity and speciﬁcity are highly dependent upon the signal threshold deﬁnitions. However,
we wanted to compare the signal detection performance of commonly used DMIs (i.e., PCR, COR,
and IC) and the newly introduced DMI, RR. Other
methods have been or are being developed based on

various statistical algorithms or techniques including
probability ﬁltering, fuzzy logic, sequential probability
ratio testing, and tree-based scan statistics.5 Therefore,
for comparison, we chose the original criteria introduced
for the ﬁrst time with the index for signal detection. Various signal detection indices, as well as criteria, could be
applied and evaluated in future research.
CONCLUSION
The ﬁrst step in developing a modern drug safety
monitoring system is the identiﬁcation of prospective
detection tools,24 and the claims databases can be a
valuable source for the active monitoring of safety signals. This study showed that of the selected four DMIs
used to detect signals associated with celecoxib within
the Korean HIRA database, the RR had the highest
sensitivity for predicting signals. The RR can be an
effective signal detection index to be used by health
providers or regulatory authorities for the early detection of signals in a health claims database. In addition,
this approach could be useful as an active surveillance
of signals, provide timely preventive strategies, and
improve safety of the medical care system.

KEY POINTS

•
•
•
•

Several data-mining indices (DMIs) based on the
disproportionality of adverse events (AEs)
reported have been used to detect signals in
spontaneous reporting databases.
None of the proposed DMIs are ideal tools for
detecting signals using the health insurance
claims database.
The DMIs included proportional claims ratio,
claims odds ratio, information component, and
relative risk (RR).
This study showed that RR had a higher sensitivity and predictability in detecting the reference
AEs compared to other proposed indices.
