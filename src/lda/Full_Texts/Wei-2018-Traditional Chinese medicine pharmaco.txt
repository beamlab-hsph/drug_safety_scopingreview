Abstract
Background: Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) is a style of traditional medicine informed by modern medicine
but built on a foundation of more than 2500 years of Chinese medical practice. According to statistics, TCM
accounts for approximately 14% of total adverse drug reaction (ADR) spontaneous reporting data in China. Because
of the complexity of the components in TCM formula, which makes it essentially different from Western medicine,
it is critical to determine whether ADR reports of TCM should be analyzed independently.
Methods: Reports in the Chinese spontaneous reporting database between 2010 and 2011 were selected. The
dataset was processed and divided into the total sample (all data) and the subsample (including TCM data only).
Four different ADR signal detection methods-PRR, ROR, MHRA and IC- currently widely used in China, were applied for
signal detection on the two samples. By comparison of experimental results, three of them—PRR, MHRA and IC—were
chosen to do the experiment. We designed several indicators for performance evaluation such as R (recall ratio),
P (precision ratio), and D (discrepancy ratio) based on the reference database and then constructed a decision tree for
data classification based on such indicators.
Results: For PRR: R1-R2 = 0.72%, P1-P2 = 0.16% and D = 0.92%; For MHRA: R1-R2 = 0.97%, P1-P2 = 0.20% and D = 1.18%;
For IC: R1-R2 = 1.44%, P2-P1 = 4.06% and D = 4.72%. The threshold of R,Pand Dis set as 2%, 2% and 3% respectively.
Based on the decision tree, the results are “separation” for PRR, MHRA and IC.
Conclusions: In order to improve the efficiency and accuracy of signal detection, we suggest that TCM data should be
separated from the total sample when conducting analyses.

Background
The World Health Organization (WHO) defines adverse
drug reactions (ADRs) as harmful and unintended reactions, which occur from the standard use of medicinal
dosages for prophylaxis, diagnosis or treatment of diseases, or for the modification of physiological functions.
ADRs include side effects, toxic effects, residual effects,
idiosyncratic reactions, multiple infections arising from
anti-infectives, drug dependence, and carcinogenic and
mutagenic actions [1]. It is very difficult to identify the
potential drug risks in clinical tests due to a range of

issues, such as small sample size, limited observation
time and scope. Subsequently, unintended adverse reactions may occur during medication use posing further
threats to health and causing a financial burden on the
patients. To strengthen monitoring of ADRs, China has
established the ADR Monitoring Center and carried out
appropriate endeavors since 1989. China established a
national network system for ADR monitoring in 2003.
By the end of 2016, the number of spontaneous reports
submitted through the network has reached nearly
10,750,000 and has been drastically increasing at a rate
of 1 million per year.
Currently, the methods used in signal detection in
China mainly include Proportional Reporting Ratio
(PRR), Reporting Odds Ratio (ROR), Medicines and

Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) and
Information Component (IC) [2–9]. These methods calculate signal scores, i.e., the values for PRR, ROR and
IC, to assess whether a drug is significantly associated with
an adverse event. These calculations or algorithms, socalled the disproportionality analyses or measures, however, differ from one another in that the PRR, MHRA and
ROR are frequentist (non-Bayesian), whereas the IC is
Bayesian [10]. Many scholars of China have applied these
methods on Chinese ADR data, but consistency in the
detection results is poor [11–13]. So, no signal detection
method that conforms to ADR data quality in China has
been established. The co-existence of multiple detection
methods causes challenge in signal detection. Moreover,
the Chinese ADR database includes all drugs such as
TCM, Western medicine, and biological products, but signal detection is not categorized by drug types. Owing to
the large volume of data (about ten million), the variety of
methods and the complexity of data processing, the China
National Center for ADR Monitoring requires approximately two weeks to perform signal detection for all data,
and the large amount of selected signals still need to be
manually analyzed by experts. Thus, the efficiency of signal discovery is very low. Presently, there is no research
on whether ADR data can be categorized by drug type
before signal detection.
Combining TCM pharmacology with modern technologies, more drug types and preparations have entered
Chinese market increasingly. The data system of the
China Food and Drug Administration (CFDA) has shown
60,029 authorized TCMs as of October 17, 2013 [14].
Because of increased usage, the lack of knowledge about
TCM and misuse, there is a surge in the amount of TCM
ADR reports and the types of drugs involved. In the past
few years, the CFDA has warned about the severe adverse
reactions of Xiangdan, Shengmai, Xiyanping, Mailuoning,
and Honghua (Safflower) injections, the safety issues of
Lei Gong Teng (Tripterygium wilfordii) preparation, and
the digestive reactions of the compound Qingdai pill. For
example, Shengmai injection is a traditional Chinese
medicine injection composed of Red Ginseng, Ophiopogon
japonicus and Schisandra Chinensis. The adverse reactions of Shengmai injection in severe cases are as follows:
body as a whole-general disorders accounted for about
53.2%, respiratory system disorders accounted for 20.7%
and cardiovascular disorders accounted for about 11.4%.
A total of 179 cases of Shengmai injection were reported,
including anaphylactic shock (90) and severe anaphylactoid reaction (89), accounting for about 35.2% of all severe
cases [15].
TCMs can be relatively crude preparations usually
prepared as formula of numerous herbal and other
natural-source ingredients, and as patent medicines i.e.
manufactured, formulated products also containing

Page 2 of 9

numerous ingredients (sometimes they include conventional drug ingredients). TCMs have a botanical name,
prescription name, trade name and pharmaceutical
name. Usually, their names include Chinese names, Pin
Yin names and Latin names. In China, generic drug
names refer to China Approved Drug Names (CADN),
which are the legal names of drugs formulated by the
Pharmacopoeia Committee in accordance with the
principle of CADN and submitted to the Ministry of
public health for the record. All drugs composed of the
same ingredients or the same formula have generic drug
names are mandatory and binding. Generic drug names
must be used on the label, instruction or package of
listed drugs. So, each TCM in the spontaneous reporting
data owns a unique generic drug name, named by
Chinese characters (includes Pin Yin). ADR signal detection is based on generic drug names. In contrast with conventional medicines, TCMs are chemically rich complex
mixtures comprising several hundreds of constituents,
often more [16]. Owing to the inherent characteristics of
TCM, the factors influencing its ADRs are more complicated than Western medicine. An understanding of the
evaluation criteria on TCM ADR has always been vague.
There is a lack of scientific, objective, and unbiased
methods to evaluate TCM ADR [17, 18]. Some experts
have pointed out that because of the special nature of
TCM, its ADR data are quite different from those of
Western medicine; thus, its ADR signal detection should
be performed separately [16, 19]. The purpose of this
paper is to solve the problem whether TCM should be
separated for signal detection.

Methods
Data resource

A total of 1,823,144 ADR reports from 2010 and 2011
were obtained from the CFDA. Of these, 608,710
(33.4%) reports had one drug linked to multiple ADRs.
The reports were further split into one drug to one ADR
relationship. Reports with “unknown” drug name or
ADRs were excluded. Following data processing, a total
of 2,221,942 records were obtained. There are 317,417
records of TCM accounting for 14.29%; 1,874,904 records of “Western medicine” accounting for 84.38%; and
29,621 records of “biological products” accounting for
1.33%. The overall data were aggregated based on generic drug names of drugs and names of ADRs; as such,
139,281 drug-ADR pairs with their corresponding frequencies were obtained: this data set is Data1. This
data set included 6174 drugs and 2458 ADRs.
In order to determine the effectiveness of classifying
data for signal detection, a reference database of known
ADRs needed to be established for comparison. The
reference database was obtained from the CFDA and it
was extracted from drug product labeling manually. The

Wei et al. BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making (2018) 18:19

ADRs in the drug product labeling were collected primarily from pre-market clinical trials. In addition, side
effects detected by the ADR monitoring system and verified by the experts would also be added to the drug
product labeling during post-marketing. The drug name
and ADR name of the reference database were mapped
to the spontaneous reporting data. It includes 53,774
drug-ADR pairs and involves 2401 different drugs and
2460 different ADRs. The reference database will be
noted as Data2.
Based on the two datasets, we make the further data
processing as follows:
1. For Data1, because usually a minimum occurrence
of 3 is accepted in signal detection, ADR data with
an occurrence of less than 3 were removed from
Data1. Further, for consistency in the reference
database, drugs that were present in Data1 but
absent in Data2 were removed from Data1. This
resulted in a dataset with 39,782 records, involving
1692 different drugs and 877 ADRs. This dataset is
referred to as the total sample.
2. TCM data were extracted from the total
sample, generating a TCM dataset. The dataset
included 4697 records, involving 326 drugs and 283
ADRs. This dataset is referred to as the
subsample, and it is a proper subset of the
total sample.
3. Fields in the two datasets include “type of drug”,
“generic drug name”, “name of ADR”, “occurrence
frequency”, “known or not”, etc. The Data2 is used
to annotate the field “known or not” in the total
sample and the subsample: if the drug-ADR
pair that appeared in the reference database, it was
annotated as “1,” otherwise it was annotated as “0.”
Selection of signal detection methods

Currently, ADR signal detection methods in China
utilize such four mainstream methods as: PRR, ROR,
MHRA, and IC, and the calculations of measures of disproportionality are primarily based upon a two-by-two
contingency table (Table 1) [20].
The four methods are applied to the subsample respectively. The signal detection of the subsample was
done at the TCM product level. The results of positive
signals are listed in Table 2.

As shown in Table 2, the numbers of positive signals
generated by PRR, ROR, MHRA and IC showed a
decreasing relationship. Using “1” to indicate positive
signal and “0” to indicate non-positive signal, the correlation coefficients of the detection results of the four
methods are shown in Table 3 and Table 4.
We knew from Tables 3 and 4 that the correlation
coefficient of PRR and ROR was close to 1(0.9887 and
0.9721), that is, the outcomes of the two methods are
basically identical. At the same time, the two approaches
are based on the theory of disproportionality. Therefore,
it’s necessary to use both PRR and POR. We chose PRR,
MHRA, and IC as the three methods for signal detection
in this study. All the methods of signal detection were
implemented with Visual FoxPro database software 6.0.
Decision-making process

To judge the superiority and inferiority of the signal
detection outcomes in the two samples before and after
data separation, the following issues needed to be
addressed: How to evaluate the difference of results of
signal detection methods applied to the two samples before and after data separation? What indicators were
needed to be set for discrimination? What was the decision- making process? Flowchart on decision-making
process is presented as follows (Fig. 1).
Detecting signals in the total sample and the
subsample respectively. Then, two results were obtained.
Some indicators of evaluation method were constructed
and used to evaluate the superiority and inferiority of the
two results. The decision-making was conducted based on
the reference database and the evaluation results.

Fourfold table design based on the reference database

The reference database provided an objective evidence
for classification decisions. Signal detection of the two
samples was performed and compared with the reference database, which could be structured into a fourfold
table as follows (Table 5).
In Table 5, a represents the number of ADR pairs with
positive signals in both the total sample and the
subsample, a1 represents the number of ADR pairs that
are present in the total sample, the subsample,
and the reference database, a0 represents the number of
ADR pairs that are present in the total sample and
the subsample but are absent in the reference database, and a = a1 + a0. The other symbols such as b(b1, b0),
c(c1, c0) and d(d1, d0) are analogous to a(a1, a0). The ADR
pairs in b1 and c1 are distinct signals between two samples,
and thus can be used as a basis for classification decision.
Evaluation method

1) Indicator R - Recall ratio
The recall ratio, a measure of the coverage of known
signals, represents the ratio of the signals detected from
the reference database. Using recall ratio R1 to describe
the ability to detect known signals in the total
sample, as represented by formula (1):

Fig. 1 Decision-making process flowchart

Page 4 of 9

R1 ¼

a1 þ b 1
a1 þ b1 þ c1 þ d 1

ð1Þ

From Table 5, we can see that a1 + b1 + c1 + d1 is the
total number of known signals and a1 + b1 is the number
of known signals detected in the total sample.
Similarly, using recall ratio R2 to describe the ability to
detect known signals in the subsample, as represented by formula (2):
R2 ¼

a1 þ c 1
a1 þ b1 þ c1 þ d 1

ð2Þ

By comparing the recall ratios between the two
samples, the differences in the ability to detect known
signals can be distinguished, which also reflect the differences in signal detection sensitivities between these two
samples based on the reference database. Therefore, the
recall ratio is a key indicator that should be used as the
primary basis for classification decisions.
2) Indicator P - Precision ratio
The drawback of formula (1) and (2) lies in the fact
that when a1 is much greater than b1 and c1, there is no
significant difference between b1 and c1 even though
they have markedly distinct values. Therefore, if the
difference between R1 and R2 is slight, it is necessary to
define the precision ratio. The precision ratio, a measure
of the accuracy of detecting known signals, is the proportion of the known signals detected based on a certain
sample. We use precision ratio P1 to describe the ability
to detect known signals in the total sample, which
is represented by formula (3).

From Table 5, we can see that a + b is the total
number of signals detected in the total sample and
a1 + b1 is the number of known signal detected in the
total sample. Similarly, using precision ratio P2 to
describe the ability to detect known signals in the
subsample, as represented by formula (4).

P2 ¼

In formula (5), b + c represent the total number of different detection outcomes in the two samples.
Decision tree

Using the indicators of R, P and D in the total
sample and the subsample to decide whether to
classify TCM data, the process is as follows.
1) The primary basis is to consider the coverage
percentage of known signals based on the detected
outcomes in the two samples. Specifically, the
indicator R of the two samples is considered
(See formula 1 and 2). Sample with high recall ratio
is chosen. If R1 − R2 > Rt, it is recommended to not
perform classified detection of TCM data; if
R2 − R1 > Rt, it is recommended to perform classified
detection of TCM data; if the recall ratio difference
is slight, further decision is needed (Rt represents the
threshold of R).
2) When there is little difference in recall ratios of the
two samples, the indicator P of the signal detection
needs to be considered, which is the precision
ratio of the two samples (See formula 3 and 4). If
P1 − P2 > Pt, it is recommended to not perform
classified detection of TCM data; if P2 − P1 > Pt, it is
recommended to perform classified detection of

Page 5 of 9

TCM data; if the precision ratio difference is slight,
further decision is needed (Pt represents the
threshold of P).
3) When there is little difference in both recall ratio
and precision ratio of the two samples, then
indicator D is compared. If the discrepancy ratio
exceeds the prescribed threshold (D > Dt), the
decision outcome is “non-separation”, otherwise is
“separation” (Dt represents the threshold of D).
Based on the above analysis, the decision tree for
determining whether to perform classified detection of
data is constructed as Fig. 2.

Results
The statistical results of the two samples are shown in
Table 6 and Table 7.
The PRR, MHRA, and IC methods are used to perform experiments with the total sample and the
subsample and the results are shown in Table 8.
A decision-making table (Table 9) is established using
data from Table 8 and the classification decision tree.
The thresholds of three indicators are set based on the
mean of the differences of R, P and D across three signal
detection methods. For R, the difference of PRR, MHRA
and IC is 0.72%, 0.97% and 1.44%, so the mean of three
differences about equal to 1.04%. Thus, the threshold of
R is set to 2%, an integer slightly larger than the
mean. Similarly, for P, the mean of the differences is
(0.16% + 0.20% + 4.06%)/3 ≈ 1.47%, so the threshold of
P is set to 2%. For D, the mean of the differences is
(0.92% + 1.18% + 4.72%) /3 ≈ 2.73%, so the threshold of
D is set to 3%. In brief, we set Rt to 2%, Pt to 2% and Dt to
3% in the following decision process. Based on the
decision tree (see Fig. 2), the decision-making process is
as follows:
1) PRR: because R1-R2 = 0.72% < 2%, P1-P2 = 0.16% < 2%
and D = 0.92% < 3%, the conclusion is “Separation”.
2) MHRA: because R1-R2 = 0.97% < 2%, P1-P2 = 0.20% < 2%
and D = 1.18% < 3%, the conclusion is “Separation”.
3) IC: because R1-R2 = 1.44% < 2%, P2-P1 = 4.06% > 2%,
the conclusion is “Separation”.
Thus, the conclusion of “Separation” is reached by
using all three methods.

Discussion
Comparative analysis of two samples

The statistical results of two samples are shown in Table 6.
The total sample includes 1,972,008 ADR reports,
involving 1692 drugs, 39,782 drug-ADR pairs, and 877
ADRs. The average number of ADRs is 1165.49 for each

drug and 49.57 for each drug-ADR pair, whereas each
ADR has an average frequency of 2248.58.
The subsample is a collection of all reports of TCM
removed from the total sample. It contains 199,115
ADR reports of TCM, accounting for 10.1% of the
total sample, in which 326 drugs, 4697 drug-ADR
pairs, and 283 ADRs are involved. The average number
of ADRs is 610.78 for each drug and 42.39 for each
drug-ADR pair, whereas each ADR has an average frequency of 703.59. Compared with the total sample,
the average frequency of the subsample is respectively reduced by 554.7, 7.18 and 1545.
Compared with the reference database, the total
sample contains 13,555 known drug-ADR pairs, and
the proportion is 34.07%; the subsample contains
830 known drug-ADR pairs, and the proportion is
17.67%, 16.4% less than that in the total sample.
Specifically, known drug-ADR pairs in the TCM database are far less than those in the total sample.
The total sample contains 88,083 serious reports,
accounting for 4.47%. The subsample contains 10,007
serious reports, accounting for 5.03%. Therefore, the

subsample has relatively higher serious report proportion than the total sample.
Table 7 shows the top ten ADRs with highest frequency in two samples. For each sample, the sum of
their frequency is close to 60%. Seven of the top ten
adverse reactions are the same between the two samples.
The obvious difference between the two samples is that
“headache” (2.87%), “abdominal pain” (2.65%) and
“diarrhea” (2.53%) in the total sample, and “palpitation” (4.38%), “chest tightness” (3.14%) and “fever” (2.94%)
in the subsample. The top three adverse reactions in
both samples are “rash” (14.27% vs 16.15%), “nausea”
(11.48% vs 7.20%) and “pruritus” (8.78% vs 11.42%), but
the proportion of “nausea” is 4.28% higher in the total
sample than that in the subsample, while “pruritus”
is 2.64% lower than that in the subsample.
Discussion of methods

This paper presents a decision method by comparing
signal detection results before and after separating TCM
data from the total sample. The method employs
two important formulas of information retrieval theory:
recall ratio and precision ratio. Recall ratio is an indicator of success which represents the proportion of known
ADRs retrieved from all known TCM ADRs. Precision
ratio refers to the proportion of known ADR in all retrieved signals, and is an indicator of signal-noise ratio.
In the design of decision-making tree, we first consider
the recall ratio, which is about whether more known signals can be detected with independent signal detection
in TCM sample. If there is no difference in recall ratio,
further consideration should be given to the precision

Table 9 gives the values of all indicators of the three
methods. Since the PRR method detects the most signals, it contains the largest number of known ADR,
resulting in the highest recall ratio of 72.41%. The recall
ratios of MHRA and IC are 61.69% and 38.19% respectively. But the precision ratio is opposite. Although
the total amount of signals detected by IC is the
smallest, its precision ratio is the highest, 42.15%, while
the precision ratios of PRR and MHRA are 27.10% and
27.89% respectively.
For PRR and MHRA, decision-making paths are consistent and the results are all “Separation” because all
the values of three indicators fall within the according
thresholds. For IC, however, decision-making path is
deferent from PRR and MHRA. The recall ratio of the
two samples is very similar, but the subsample has a
significantly high precision ratio than the total
sample. So, the conclusion is “Separation” for IC.
The dataset of this research is fixed, that is to say, the
total sample and the subsample are fixed, so the
values of three indicators calculated based on two
samples are constant, and they will not change with the
different threshold. Thus, it is impossible to determine
the optimum threshold in traditional ways such as
Precision Recall curve, Receiver Operating Characteristic

ratio. In addition, the discrepancy ratio is added for
decision-making when the above two indicators cannot
work well. The decision method is based on the reference
database and the proportion of known ADRs of TCM in it
is very low (17.67%), this could result in uncertainty of the
decision outcome. At the same time, according to the previous data analysis, there have been some differences in the
two samples. Thus, according to the TCM data characteristics, the decision result is biased towards “separation” when
the corresponding values of the three indicators are relatively close before and after data separation.
Discussion of results

Table 8 shows the experiment results with the three detection methods. For PRR, the total number of signals
detected in the total sample is 2209, the
subsample is 2218, and the number of common signals is 1888. For MHRA, the number of signals detected
in the total sample is 1820, the subsample is
1836, and the number of common signals is 1488, which
is 389, 382, and 400 less than that of the PRR method.
For IC, the total number of signals detected in the
total sample is 660, the subsample is 752, and the
number of common signals is 579. Obviously, among the
three methods, IC detects the lowest number of signals.

Curve or Mean Average Precision. In this paper, the
choice of the threshold is mainly based on the mean
value of the difference between the same indicator
across all methods before and after data separation. If
the ADR data of more years can be obtained, we can
group data by increasing year by year to observe change
trends of the difference value of the three indicators. It
will help to determine the thresholds more accurately.
This will be the further work we need to do.

and the subsample (TCM). Experiment results show
that the conclusions are all “Separation” for PRR, MHRA
and IC. Thus, we suggest that TCM data should be separated from the total data when conducting analyses.

Limitations

Acknowledgements
Thanks to the CFDA for providing data necessary for this research.

Our research has a few limitations. First, the low quality
of the ADR report data and the co-existence of multiple
signal detection methods may bring uncertainty to the
results. Second, this study is based on the data provided
by the CFDA during 2010–2011. The limited amount of
data (approximately 2.2 million) may not be representative of the total data of the CFDA (approximately 10
million). Third, another limitation of the study is the use
of only the ADRs extracted from drug product labeling
manually. In China, there is a requirement that all ADRs
observed in clinical studies should be submitted as spontaneous reports and those verified by the experts should
be added to the drug product labeling. But the reference
database might not include the kinds of signals which
are novel and unexpected associations that appear once
a drug is used by a broader group of individuals.

Conclusion
Whether TCM should be independent signal detection
or not has become an important issue of pharmacovigilance in China. In order to address this problem, we
propose a method based on decision tree in this study.
We first analyze the results of applying four mainstream
ADR signal detection methods that have been used
widely in China and select three of these four methods.
We set three indicators used for performance evaluation
such as R, P and D based on the reference database, and
then construct a decision tree for data classification. Finally, we conduct experiment on the total sample
