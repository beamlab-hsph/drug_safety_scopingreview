ABSTRACT

ARTICLE HISTORY

Background: Herpes zoster (HZ), or shingles, is caused by reactivation of varicella-zoster virus in latently
infected individuals. Live-attenuated HZ vaccine (zoster vaccine live, ZVL) is approved in the United States
for persons aged 50 years and recommended by the CDC for persons 60 years. Methods: We analyzed
U.S. reports of adverse events (AEs) following ZVL submitted to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting
System (VAERS), a spontaneous reporting system to monitor vaccine safety, for persons vaccinated May 1,
2006, through January 31, 2015. We conducted descriptive analysis, clinical reviews of reports with
selected pre-speciﬁed conditions, and empirical Bayesian data mining. Results: VAERS received 23,092
reports following ZVL, of which 22,120 (96%) were classiﬁed as non-serious. Of reports where age was
documented (n D 18,817), 83% were in persons aged 60 years. Reporting rates of AEs were 106 and 4.4
per 100,000 ZVL doses distributed for all reports and serious reports, respectively. When ZVL was
administered alone among persons aged 50 years, injection site erythema (27%), HZ (17%), injection site
swelling (17%), and rash (14%) were the most commonly reported symptoms among non-serious reports;
HZ (29%), pain (18%), and rash (16%) were the most commonly reported symptoms among serious
reports. Six reports included laboratory evidence of vaccine-strain varicella-zoster virus (Oka/Merck strain)
infection; AEs included HZ, HZ- or varicella-like illness, and local reaction with vesicles. In our review of
reports of death with sufﬁcient information to determine cause (n D 46, median age 75 years), the most
common causes were heart disease (n D 28), sepsis (n D 4), and stroke (n D 3). Empirical Bayesian data
mining did not detect new or unexpected safety signals. Conclusions: Findings from our safety review of
ZVL are consistent with those from pre-licensure clinical trials and other post-licensure assessments.
Transient injection-site reactions, HZ, and rashes were most frequently reported to VAERS following ZVL.
Overall, our results are reassuring regarding the safety of ZVL.

Introduction
Herpes zoster (HZ), or shingles, is caused by reactivation of
varicella-zoster virus (VZV) years to decades after initial
infection.1 Varicella incidence has declined in the United States
since the introduction of varicella vaccine (VarivaxÒ , Merck &
Co.) in 1996.2 However, in 2017, almost all adults aged 65 or
older remain latently infected with wild-type VZV (w-VZV).3
An estimated 1 million cases of HZ occur each year in the
United States, often resulting in lasting and debilitating
pain.1,4,5 Increasing age and immunosuppression are primary
risk factors.1,5 Symptoms are difﬁcult to control, particularly
among the elderly, who are often unable to tolerate analgesics
and psychoactive medications.6
Live-attenuated HZ vaccine (zoster vaccine live, ZVL)
(ZostavaxÒ , Merck & Co.), which prevents development of HZ,
contains the same Oka/Merck vaccine-strain VZV (v-VZV)
used in VarivaxÒ , but with 19,400 plaque-forming units per
dose compared to 1,350 for VarivaxÒ .7-10 In clinical trials,
ZVL was 51.3% (adults aged 60 years)11 and 69.8% (adults

aged 50–59 years)12 efﬁcacious in preventing HZ. Injection-site
reactions and headaches were common following ZVL11,12;
serious adverse events (AEs) within the ﬁrst 42 days after
vaccination occurred in 1.4 % of persons aged 60 years11,13
and in 0.6% among persons aged 50–59 years.12 In 2006, the
U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved ZVL for
adults aged 60 years.7,8 Approval was expanded to include
adults aged 50–59 years in 2011.14 The Advisory Committee on
Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends ZVL for persons
aged 60 years.5,14 It is the ﬁrst live-attenuated vaccine routinely recommended for older adults. Results from a post-licensure safety study in the early years following licensure were
consistent with ﬁndings from pre-licensure clinical trials.15
However, routine safety surveillance of ZVL is confounded by
age-related illnesses that are common in in the elderly population recommended for vaccination with ZVL. To further assess
the safety of ZVL, we reviewed AE reports to the U.S. Vaccine
Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS).

Methods
Overview and data source
VAERS is a national spontaneous reporting system, co-managed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
and the FDA, that monitors the safety of U.S.-licensed vaccines.16 VAERS receives reports of AEs following vaccination
from healthcare providers, vaccine manufacturers, patients,
parents, and others. Signs and symptoms of reported AEs are
coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities
(MedDRA), an internationally standardized terminology.17
Reports are assigned 1 or more MedDRA preferred terms (PT);
MedDRA PTs are not necessarily medically conﬁrmed diagnoses. VAERS may also receive reports of administration errors
(i.e., wrong vaccine administered, wrong age) regardless of
outcome.
Reports describing death, life-threatening illness (as
deﬁned by the reporter), hospitalization (or its prolongation), or permanent disability are classiﬁed as serious
according to the Code of Federal Regulations.18 For serious
reports submitted by anyone other than vaccine manufacturers, medical records are routinely requested and made
available to VAERS personnel; for reports of deaths, efforts
are made to obtain autopsy reports or death certiﬁcates.
Vaccine manufacturers are required to submit reports to
VAERS of AEs that come to their attention and are responsible for conducting appropriate follow-up on these reports.
We conducted 3 categories of analyses: automated descriptive analysis of reports, clinical reviews of reports of pre-speciﬁed conditions, and empirical Bayesian (EB) data mining.
Automated analysis
We searched the VAERS database for U.S. reports received
from May 1, 2006, through February 28, 2015, with a ZVL vaccination date from May 1, 2006, through January 31, 2015. We
conducted descriptive analyses of reports by age, sex, serious
and non-serious status, reporter type, and the most commonly
reported MedDRA PTs. We calculated crude AE reporting
rates for all reports, serious reports and anaphylaxis reports,
dividing reports by the number of ZVL doses distributed in the
U.S. market for years 2006 through 2014.

preventable vaccination errors (a wrong vaccine given and
ZVL administration during pregnancy). For reports of
death, a board certiﬁed pathologist reviewed medical
records, autopsy reports, death certiﬁcates, and other available documentation obtained on follow-up to determine
cause of death.
Empirical Bayesian (EB) data mining
We conducted EB data mining19 to identify AEs reported more
frequently than expected following ZVL compared to all other
U.S.-licensed vaccines. We used published criteria20 and
adjusted for sex, age and year to identify ZVL-AE pairs
reported at least twice as frequently as expected (i.e., lower
bound of the 90% conﬁdence interval surrounding the EB
geometric mean [EB05 >2]).

Results
Descriptive analysis
VAERS received 23,092 U.S. reports following ZVL during the
analytic period (Table 1); 972 (4%) were classiﬁed as serious,
including 74 deaths. Among reports that included patient age
(n D 18,817), median age was 65 years (range 7 months101 years), with the majority aged 60 years (Table 1). In
20,884 (90% of total reports), ZVL was given alone. Among
persons aged 50 years who received ZVL alone, injection-site
reactions, HZ and rash were the most commonly reported
non-serious AEs; while HZ, pain, rash, dyspnea and pyrexia
were the most commonly reported serious AEs (Table 2).
Based on 21,846,030 doses of ZVL distributed in the United
States from licensure in 2006 through 2014 (personal communication, Merck & Co.), crude AE reporting rates were 106 per
100,000 doses distributed for all reports and 4.4 per 100,000 for
serious reports.

Clinical review of reports
We reviewed reports of the following pre-speciﬁed conditions (see Appendix 1 for search strategy): serious reports
of cellulitis at (or around) the ZVL injection site within
7 days of vaccination, anaphylaxis, serious reports of ophthalmic herpes zoster, rash in a contact of a vaccinated
patient, vaccination error reports involving administration
of a wrong vaccine, reports with laboratory evidence of vVZV infection, reports of ZVL administration during pregnancy, and deaths. We chose these conditions because they
represent serious or medically important AEs of concern
for post-licensure vaccine safety surveillance (cellulitis,
anaphylaxis, ophthalmic herpes zoster, and deaths, rash in a
contact of a vaccinated patient, and reports with laboratory
evidence of v-VZV infection), or represent common,

per million doses distributed. Among the 11 cases, 7 received
ZVL only. Eight reports documented hospitalization. Six of these
11 reports documented a history of allergies as follows: 1) iodine,
erythromycin 2) dust mites, food additives (including monosodium glutamate which is contained in the vaccine) 3) shellﬁsh,
bee stings, contrast dye used in intravenous pyelogram, codeine
4) clindamycin, erythromycin, penicillin, raloxifene, 5) Nonsteroidal anti-inﬂammatory drugs, barbiturates 6) beef and pork
(their by-products are contained in the vaccine) and dairy. There
were no deaths among the anaphylaxis reports.
Serious reports of ophthalmic herpes zoster
Of 106 reports with a MedDRA PT of ophthalmic herpes zoster, 15 met the regulatory deﬁnition of serious. Seven reports
stated that ophthalmic herpes zoster occurred several months
or years after ZVL vaccination. In 3 reports, the onset interval
of ophthalmic signs or symptoms was not provided. Two cases
were not zoster; 1 person developed herpes simplex iridocyclitis, and another developed uveitis but it was unclear whether
the uveitis case had ever received ZVL. Of the remaining 3,
ophthalmic complications began within 15 days after vaccination: ophthalmic shingles and herpetic keratitis with corneal
involvement, both in ZVL recipients, and herpes zoster of the
right eye of a family member of someone who had received
ZVL 7 days earlier.

Clinical review of reports of pre-speciﬁed conditions
(as deﬁned in Appendix 1)
Serious reports of cellulitis at (or around) the ZVL injection
site within 7 days of vaccination
We identiﬁed 41 reports of cellulitis at (or around) the ZVL
injection site that occurred within 7 days of vaccination and
were classiﬁed as serious; 31 when ZVL was the only vaccine
administered in the arm with cellulitis. Nineteen reports
described hospitalization speciﬁcally for the cellulitis and treatment with intravenous antibiotics, 15 of which documented
administration of ZVL only.

Rash in a contact of a vaccinated patient
We identiﬁed 98 reports of rashes occurring in contacts of vaccinated patients; 12 were serious, with concurrent AEs including pneumonia and confusion, and HZ- and varicella-like
illnesses. Among 55 reports documenting age of the contact,
ages ranged from 6 weeks to 90 years (median 58 years).
Among 59 reports documenting onset, median time to rash
was 10 days following ZVL vaccination of the primary patient
(range 0 days-2 years). Of the 98 reports of rashes occurring in
contacts of vaccinated patients, in 71, it was unknown from the
report if the primary vaccinated patient had a rash. Among the
remaining 27 reports, 5 primary vaccinated patients had various rashes preceding the rash in the contact and 22 did not
have any rash. Laboratory test results were documented for 5
contacts with a rash; 2 tested positive for w-VZV and the
remainder were negative for any VZV. Of these 5 contacts with
laboratory testing, in 3, the primary vaccinated patient did not
have a rash and in 2 it was unknown if the if the primary vaccinated patient had a rash. No laboratory tests were documented
on contacts of primary vaccinated patients who had rashes.

Anaphylaxis
We identiﬁed 36 reports of anaphylaxis following ZVL, a reporting rate of 1.6 reports per million doses distributed. Median age
was 66 years (range 50–79 years). Medical records were available
for 13 reports; onset ranged from 10 minutes to less than 3 days.
A diagnosis of anaphylaxis was supported in 11 of the 13 reports,
based on either Brighton Collaboration criteria21 (n D 4 at Level
1 – the highest level of diagnostic certainty, and n D 4 at Level 2)
or documented physician diagnosis (n D 3). When restricted to
these 11 cases, the reporting rate for anaphylaxis was 0.5 reports

Vaccination error reports involving a wrong vaccine given
We identiﬁed 744 reports of ZVL vaccination errors involving
administration of a wrong vaccine; 183 of these errors were
reported in 2007, the ﬁrst full year of ZVL use, and the number
fell to 76 by 2014. Of 686 reports with adequate documentation
to assess circumstances surrounding the error, 570 (83%) were
a mix-up involving administration of ZVL or varicella vaccine
(VarivaxÒ ) when the intent was to give the other. The remaining errors involved several other vaccines. Among 510 reports

1966

of ZVL being given in error instead of varicella vaccine, the
median patient age was 8 years (range 1–74 years).

Reports with laboratory evidence of v-VZV infection
We identiﬁed 6 reports of AEs following ZVL with evidence of
v-VZV infection on laboratory testing. These reports are
described in Table 3.

Deaths
We identiﬁed 74 reports of death following ZVL. Among
reports with a death certiﬁcate, autopsy report, or medical
records available (n D 46) to conﬁrm a death occurred, median
age was 75 years (range 56–94 years) and median time from
vaccination to death was 20 days (range 0–285 days). Causes of
death are listed in Table 4.
Empirical Bayesian (EB) data mining

Reports of ZVL administration during pregnancy
We identiﬁed 9 reports documenting ZVL administration during pregnancy (a contraindication7,8). Median age was 35 years
(range 30–50 years), based on 8 reports with information on
age. Among 7 reports with information on timing of vaccination, 6 women were vaccinated during ﬁrst trimester and 1 was
vaccinated during third trimester. In 5 reports, an AE was
documented, including: uncontrolled hyperglycemia (diabetic
patient), infant born with cleft lip, 2 spontaneous abortions,
and injection site erythema. Four reports did not document an
AE.
Table 3. Reports of adverse events following zoster vaccine live (ZVL) with laboratory evidence of vaccine-strain varicella-zoster virus (Oka/Merck strain) infection in
VAERS, May 2006–January 2015.
A 64-year-old male with a history of varicella in childhood and Hashimoto’s
hypothyroidism received ZVL while on chronic immunosuppression therapy
with prednisone and methotrexate for Sjogren’s syndrome and
leukocytoclastic vasculitis. He developed disseminated herpes zoster- or
varicella-like rash approximately 55 days after ZVL vaccination. He was
hospitalized for 2 days and improved with treatment of antivirals. (In the
month prior to rash development, he had been hospitalized for communityacquired pneumonia). A specimen submitted for testing to the vaccine
manufacturer by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) conﬁrmed vaccine strain
varicella-zoster virus.
A 68-year-old female with essential hypertension, hypertensive renal disease,
stage 3 chronic kidney disease, hypothyroidism, hypertriglyceridemia,
osteoporosis, prediabetes, gout, and allergy to penicillin received ZVL and
developed herpes zoster approximately 264 days later. She was treated as
an outpatient with antivirals and recovered. A specimen from the patient
submitted for testing to the CDC National Varicella Zoster Virus (VZV)
Laboratory by PCR conﬁrmed vaccine strain varicella-zoster virus.
A 51-year-old male with a history of seronegative spondyloarthritis had
underlying immunosuppression from taking methotrexate when he
received ZVL. About 6 days later he developed disseminated herpes zosteror varicella-like illness. He was treated as an outpatient and recovered.
Neither the patient nor his mother had any memory of the patient having
had prior varicella illness or varicella vaccination. A specimen from the
patient submitted for testing to the CDC National VZV Laboratory by PCR
conﬁrmed vaccine strain varicella-zoster virus.
A 73-year-old female with rheumatoid arthritis was treated intermittently with
steroids. She received ZVL and approximately 18 days later developed
herpes zoster for which she was treated as an outpatient. She stated from
memory that she had a prior history of varicella. Prior varicella vaccination
status is unknown. A specimen from the patient submitted for testing to the
vaccine manufacturer by PCR conﬁrmed vaccine strain varicella-zoster virus.
A healthy 60-year-old female with a history of varicella received ZVL.
Approximately 48 hours later, she had developed vesicles at the site of
injection, ﬂulike symptoms, and achiness. She was treated as an outpatient.
A specimen submitted for testing to the vaccine manufacturer by PCR
conﬁrmed vaccine strain varicella-zoster virus.
A 62-year-old male with history of obesity and obstructive sleep apnea received
ZVL and 19 days later developed disseminated herpes zoster- or varicellalike rash with slight fever and fatigue. He was treated as an outpatient and
recovered. A specimen from the patient submitted for testing to the CDC
National VZV Laboratory by PCR conﬁrmed vaccine strain varicella-zoster
virus.

EB data mining for ZVL revealed EB05 > 2 for the following
MedDRA PTs: Herpes zoster, Injection-site reactions, Administration errors, and Secondary transmission.

Discussion
Our review, spanning a nearly 9-year analytic period during which
time close to 22 million ZVL doses were distributed, represents the
ﬁrst comprehensive safety evaluation of ZVL in VAERS since its
licensure in 2006. Overall, our ﬁndings are consistent with those
from pre-licensure clinical trials and other post-licensure assessments.11,13,15,22 Injection site reactions were most commonly
reported. Forty-one reports of cellulitis occurring within 7 days of
vaccination were classiﬁed as serious, nearly half (n D 19) of which
described hospitalization and treatment with intravenous antibiotics; however, it is unclear if some of these cases were true bacterial
cellulitis or cellulitis-like injection site reactions, which can occur
after ZVL and other vaccines.23 The types, frequencies, and proportions of serious and non-serious AEs are generally comparable
with other vaccines given to individuals in similar age groups.24,25
Exceptions include AEs unique to or more likely to be reported in
association with a live herpes zoster vaccine, such as HZ- and varicella-like illnesses (which also accounts for reports of rash), ophthalmic herpes zoster, rash in a contact of a vaccinated patient,
and reports with laboratory evidence of v-VZV infection. However, these events have been observed in pre-licensure clinical trials

and other post-licensure safety reviews7,8,11-13,15,22 and are therefore not considered new safety concerns.
In a pivotal clinical trial, ZVL was 51.3% (95% conﬁdence interval 44.2% to 57.6%) efﬁcacious in preventing HZ
in adults aged 60 years.11 Later, in a long-term persistence
study, vaccine efﬁcacy was observed to decrease substantially over time, with conﬁdence intervals overlapping 0%
for incident HZ after 8 years.26 HZ is relatively common in
the United States as individuals age past 60 years1,4,5 and
given ZVL’s modest vaccine efﬁcacy and waning immunity
over time, a substantial number of vaccinated individuals
(coverage around 31% among adults 60 years27) will be
susceptible to wild-type HZ disease. Reports to VAERS of
HZ and HZ-like illness following ZVL (10% of which
occurred a year or more after vaccination) could represent
cases of vaccine failure or waning immunity.
Transmission of v-VZV to a contact of a ZVL vaccinated
patient has not been reported,28 but could potentially pose a safety
risk, especially if the contact has not previously been exposed to
VZV (i.e., VZV-na€ıve). VZV from HZ is transmissible from person-to-person during the time rash is present until lesions crust,5
and given that we identiﬁed reports of vaccinated patients with
HZ- and varicella-like illness and specimens positive for v-VZV,
transmission to a contact is theoretically possible. However, we
did not identify any reports with laboratory evidence of transmission of v-VZV to a contact of a vaccinated patient.
Of the 6 reports of vaccine recipients with laboratory evidence of v-VZV infection, 3 were taking, or had a history of
taking, immunosuppressing drugs (prednisone, methotrexate).
ZVL has been given safely to immunocompromised individuals
and may be particularly beneﬁcial to individuals with immunocompromising conditions and those on immunosuppressive
therapy.29,30 Healthcare providers, though, should be aware of
contraindications and precautions and proper screening procedures prior to vaccination with live virus vaccines.
ZVL is recommended for adults aged 60 years,5 a group with
increasing baseline age-related illnesses and mortality, especially
as individuals move into the eighth and ninth decades of life. As
a result, deaths following ZVL, some in close temporal association
with vaccination, would be expected due to chance alone. Of the
46 reports of death (median age 75 years) where death certiﬁcates,
autopsy reports, or medical records were available for review,
causes were consistent with those commonly observed in individuals aged 65 years in the United States,31 with heart disease and
stroke accounting for 67% of reported deaths (Table 4). We did
not observe any unusual patterns or clustering of deaths that
would suggest a causal association with ZVL.
There were a substantial number of reports (n D 744) of errors
involving wrong vaccine administered, and administration errors
signaled in empirical Bayesian data mining. Upon review, most
wrong vaccine administered reports were mix-ups between ZVL
and varicella vaccine. Vaccination errors involving mix-ups
between ZVL (ZostavaxÒ ) and varicella vaccine (VarivaxÒ ) –
which contain the same antigen, have similar naming conventions, and use similar looking antigen and diluent vials – are preventable if proper preparation and administration procedures are
followed. These procedures include conﬁrming the patient name
and age, conﬁrming the vaccine type and brand name, and
reviewing prescribing information in the vaccine package insert.32

1967

Reported errors decreased over time following licensure,
but training and other prevention strategies remain important for healthcare providers involved in vaccine administration.32 In addition, ZVL was, on rare occasions (n D 9)
reported to have been administered during pregnancy, a
contraindicating condition.7,8 This likely represents 2 errors
occurring at the same time, wrong vaccine given (women of
reproductive age should be getting varicella vaccine, not
ZVL, if they need vaccination) and a live vaccine administered to a pregnant women.

Limitations
VAERS is national in scope, accepts reports from anyone without judging clinical importance of the AE, and is effective at
rapidly detecting safety signals and rare AEs. However, it is
subject to the limitations of spontaneous reporting systems,
which include underreporting (especially for clinically nonserious AEs or AEs occurring a long time after vaccination, like
possible reactivation of v-VZV), reporting biases, problems
with data quality and completeness, and lack of an unvaccinated comparison group.16 Due to these limitations, it is generally not possible to determine if a vaccine caused an AE from
VAERS data alone. Exceptions might include HZ- or varicellalike illnesses in a patient with conclusive evidence of laboratory
conﬁrmed v-VZV infection (e.g., v-VZV isolated from a vesicle
exudate), or anaphylaxis occurring within minutes of ZVL vaccination with no evidence of any other environmental exposure
that could reasonably explain an anaphylactic reaction. Estimates of reporting rates using doses of ZVL distributed as a
denominator should be interpreted with caution, since the
actual number of doses administered is not known, nor is the
rate of underreporting. Despite its limitations, VAERS is an
important monitoring system to detect potential vaccine safety
problems that might require further investigations using controlled studies.

Conclusion
In our review of VAERS reports following ZVL, we did not
detect any unusual or unexpected patterns or any previously
unidentiﬁed safety concerns. Reports of HZ and HZ-like illness
following ZVL might indicate vaccine failure or waning immunity, rather than a de novo AE. Overall, the results of our safety
review of ZVL are reassuring.
