Because of contradictory evidence from clinical trials, the association between
angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and lung cancer needs further
evaluation. As such, the current study is to assess disproportionate reporting of
primary malignant lung cancer among reports for ACEIs submitted to the FDA adverse
event reporting system utilizing a pharmacovigilance approach. We conducted a
disproportionality analysis of primary malignant lung cancer adverse events associated
with 10 ACEIs by calculating the reported odds ratios (ROR) and information component
(IC) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). ROR was adjusted for sex, age, and reporting
year by logistic regression analyses. From January 2004 to March 2020, a total of 622
cases of lung cancer adverse event reports were identified for ACEIs users. Significant
disproportionate association was found for ACEIs as a drug class (ROR: 1.22, 95% CI:
1.13–1.32; IC: 0.28, 95% CI: 0.17–0.39. adjusted ROR: 1.23, 95% CI: 1.02–1.49). After
stratification based on gender, a subset analysis suggested that female patients exhibited
a significant disproportionate association, while male patients did not. Sensitivity analyses
that limited the data by reporting region, comorbidity, and reporting year also showed
similar trends. Statistical significant lung cancer signals were detected among patients
who received ACEI, especially female patients. The disproportionality analysis of the
FAERS database suggests mildly increased reporting of lung cancer among ACEI users.
Further robust epidemiological studies are necessary to confirm this relationship.

ACEI and Lung Cancer

BACKGROUND

FDA, 7,861,515 reports from 2004 Q1 to 2020 Q1 remained for
data analysis.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) are one
of the most widely prescribed antihypertensive medications.
ACEIs are also used in the treatment of heart disease, diabetic
nephropathy, and chronic kidney disease. ACEIs display their
mechanism of action by inhibiting the renin-angiotensinaldosterone system (RAAS) by decreasing the formation of
angiotensin II (1). Alternatively, biological studies found
angiotensin II acts on the AT1 receptor to promote cell
proliferation and angiogenesis. These actions may make crucial
implications for cancer development (2, 3).
Considering that hypertensive patients need lifelong therapy,
concerns have been put forward that long term use of ACEIs
may be associated with an increased risk of cancer (4).
However, the carcinogenic potential of ACEIs has been subject to
debate, especially in lung cancer. Multiple observational studies
exhibited mixed results, including the increased, decreased, or
unchanged risk of lung cancer in patients treated with ACEIs
(5, 6). Based on a recent cohort of 992,061 patients treated
with antihypertensive drugs, Hicks et al. reported that the use
of ACEIs was associated with a 1.14-fold higher risk of lung
cancer than the use of angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) (7).
However, in Assimes’s study, there was no significant association
between ACEI use and the lung cancer development. Given
the contradictory evidence from clinical trials, there is a need
to evaluate the link between ACEIs and lung cancer from a
new perspective.
Data mining of adverse event spontaneous reporting system
(SRS) has been carried out to assess safety reflecting drug
utilization in clinical practice. The U.S. Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) adverse event reporting system (FAERS)
provides information on medication error reports and adverse
events (AEs). Data mining algorithms are routinely applied for
the quantitative detection of signals, such as drug-associated AEs
(8). Therefore, we aim to assess the potential relevance between
ACEIs and primary malignant lung cancer AE reports through
data mining of the FAERS.

Definition of Adverse Events
Adverse events in FAERS reports are coded using the Medical
Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA, version 19.0) of
Preferred Terms (PTs). PTs are intended to represent a single
medical concept and linked with broader Higher Level Terms
(HLT), Higher Level Group Terms, and System Organ Classes.
In our study, cases were represented by the reports
retrieved under the MedDRA HLT term “Lower respiratory
tract neoplasms” for any FDA-approved ACEI (benazepril,
captopril, enalapril, fosinopril, lisinopril, moexipril, perindopril,
quinapril, ramipril, and trandolapril) as suspected, interacting
or concomitant, and irbesartan was chosen as the control drug.
Several PTs (carcinoid tumor pulmonary, leukaemic infiltration
pulmonary, endobronchial lipoma, benign respiratory tract
neoplasm, benign lung neoplasm and metastases to lung)
that were subordinated to the HLT “Lower respiratory tract
neoplasms” were excluded because these terms are not primary
malignant lung cancer. Non-cases were defined as all other
reports. Non-FDA approved ACEIs (e.g., cilazapril and
imidapril) were not included because they would suffer from
underreporting rates in FAERS.

Data Mining Algorithm
As measures of disproportionality (known as a case/non-case
method), the reporting odds ratio (ROR) and information
component (IC), along with a 95% confidence interval (CI),
were calculated to identify drug-associated adverse events as
signals (13, 14). ROR is frequentist (non-Bayesian), whereas the
IC is Bayesian. ROR and IC are recognized disproportionality
methods to identify whether a given AE (in this case, lung
cancer) is reported more frequently than expected with a given
drug (in this case, ACEIs), which allows testing the possible
disproportionate association between a drug and an adverse
event. The ROR is the odds of a specific AE occurring in a
patient exposed to a drug of interest divided by the odds of
an AE specific to another drug. The IC is a logarithmic metric
of the value, which is calculated by dividing the likelihood of
drug use and a specific AE by the product of the probability
of drug use and the probability of a particular AE occurring
when drug use and specific AE occurring are independent (15).
The equations and criteria for the two algorithms (14, 16) are
shown in Supplementary Table 1. Signals for AE were detected
when at least one of two indices met the criteria. The WHO
definition of a signal is “reported information on a possible
causal relationship between an adverse event and a drug” (17).
Basically, the higher the ROR or IC score, the stronger the
disproportion appears to be (13). The ROR allows for adjustment
using logistic regression analysis (18, 19) and has the advantage of
controlling the following covariates: sex, age, and reporting year.
The results were expressed as adjusted ROR (aROR). Reports
with missing values for the covariates mentioned above were
excluded. Thiazides, which did not show increased and decreased
risk of lung cancer occurrence from a previous study (20), were
used as the reference group.

METHODS
Data Source
To identify lung cancer AE disproportionally reported following
the use of ACEIs, a case/non-case study was conducted using
spontaneous reports submitted in FAERS between the first
quarter (Q1) of 2004 and the Q1 of 2020. All data from the
SRS database were fully anonymized by the regulatory authorities
before being used in the analysis.
OpenVigil FDA, a validated pharmacovigilance tool, was
adapted to request FAERS data using the openFDA application
programming interface to access the FDA drug-event database
with the additional openFDA drug mapping and duplicate
detection functionality (9, 10), and it is used in many
pharmacovigilance studies (11, 12). OpenVigil operates only
on cleaned FDA data by deleting most of the duplicates or
reports with missing data (9). After data cleaning by OpenVigil

ACEI and Lung Cancer

Also, a gender subset analysis was performed to further
demonstrate whether gender influences the reporting of lung
cancer. As a sensitivity analysis, we recalculated the data mining
statistics of ACEI as a class by (a) removing AEs from Europe,
(b) removing AEs of non-small lung cancer subjects, and (c)
restricting to subjects with diabetes to check for a potential
source of bias. An additional sensitivity analysis with the
timeframe from 2004 to 2011 was conducted to determine
if the disproportionate reporting of lung cancer in patients
using ACEIs might have been under- or over-estimated by
published large scale clinical trials and meta-analyses, which have
suggested increased and decreased risk of ACEIs and lung cancer
occurrence (20, 21).

RESULTS

United States

Overall, 197,320 AE reports related to ACEIs and 20,403 AE
reports on lung cancer were submitted to the FAERS in the
study period. Of these, a total of 11,248 AE reports were found
in reports pertaining to benazepril, 4,316 for captopril, 22,179
for enalapril, 3,088 for fosinopril, 98,268 for lisinopril, 427 for
moexipril, 9,383 for perindopril, 7,055 for quinapril, 41,214 for
ramipril, and 2,221 for trandolapril.
The characteristics of AE reports submitted for ACEIs are
described in Table 1. The gender subset analysis showed that
ACEI reports associated with lung cancer were higher in female
patients than male patients (50.2 vs. 46.0%; in 3.8%, the sex
of the involved patient was unknown or missing). The largest
percentages of reports (28.0%) were in patients aged 45–64 years.
Cases exposed to ACEIs were mainly from the United States
(67.5%), Canada (5.3%), and the United Kingdom (4.2%). ACEIs
is most frequently used for unknown indication (n = 465),
hypertension (n = 167) and heart disease (n = 9).
Figure 1 lists the results of disproportionality analysis between
ACEIs and lung cancer. Overall, based on the criteria for
the two algorithms, the signal of lung cancer was detected
for ACEI assessed together as a drug class (ROR: 1.22, 95%
CI: 1.13–1.32; IC: 0.28, 95% CI: 0.17–0.39). After adjusting
sex, age, and reporting year, aROR for the ACEI class was
1.23 (95% CI, 1.02–1.49).
As a single agent, we found statistically significant lung cancer
signals for the following agents: enalapril, fosinopril, lisinopril,
quinapril, and trandolapril. Benazepril, captopril, moexipril,
perindopril, and ramipril were not identified.
With regards to the gender subset, a significant signal of ACEI
as a drug class was showed in female patients (ROR: 1.36, 95% CI:
1.21–1.53; IC: 0.43, 95% CI: 0.27–0.60) but not in male patients
(ROR: 0.99, 95% CI: 0.88–1.10; IC: −0.02, 95% CI: −0.18 to 0.14)
(Figure 2).
To test the robustness of the above findings, sensitivity
analyses that limited (a) the submitted year of AE (ROR:
1.18, 95% CI: 1.07–1.31; IC: 0.23, 95% CI: 0.09–0.37), (b) AEs
excluding non-small lung cancer subjects (ROR: 1.20, 95% CI:
1.11–1.29; IC: 0.24, 95% CI: 0.14–0.35), and (c) subjects with
diabetes (ROR: 1.57, 95% CI: 1.14–2.18; IC: 0.58, 95% CI: 0.15–
1.01) did not affect the results. Another sensitivity analysis

removing AEs from Europe also showed a similar trend for
ACEIs, consistent with the estimation of our primary analysis
(ROR: 1.50, 95% CI: 1.37–1.64; IC: 0.57, 95% CI: 0.44–0.69)
(Figure 2).

DISCUSSION
This study is the first analysis to investigate the potential
link between ACEIs and primary malignant lung cancer using
a pharmacovigilance approach. There is a disproportionate
association of lung cancer among ACEIs users, especially in
the female group based on our analysis. Undoubtedly, current
literature reveals an inconsistent conclusion of the association
between ACEIs and lung cancer. In Gokhale’s study, it appeared
that there was no evidence of an association between ACEIs and
lung cancer incidence (hazard ratio = 0.99, 95% CI: 0.84–1.16)
(22). Meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials found no risk
of lung cancer and even decreased risk in patients taking ACEIs
(23, 24). On the other hand, a meta-analysis with 324,168 patients

has the potential to stimulate the growth of cancer cells
through binding with various receptors (27). It was found that
bradykinin induces tumor-associated angiogenesis by promoting
the release of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF),
facilitated cancer invasion, and metastases by activating matrix
metalloproteinase (28, 29). The recent study indicated bradykinin
promoted inflammatory factor (interleukin-8, interleukin-6, and
cyclooxygenase-2) secretion, thereby contributing to malignancy
progression (30–32).
Furthermore, ACEIs could lead to the accumulation of
substance P, which is involved in tumor proliferation, migration,
and angiogenesis (33, 34). Our study indicated a significant
signal of lung cancer in female patients taking ACEIs, but
not in male patients, which supports this hypothesis. A dry
cough is one of the most common adverse reactions with ACEI
use, which is more common in women than in men (35, 36).
The underlying mechanism of ACEI cough is related to the
accumulation of bradykinin and substance P, which stimulate
vagal afferent fibers and sub-serve the cough reflex (36–39).
Polymorphism in the ACE gene has been suggested to be
associated with the susceptibility to cough in women (40).
Whether these mechanisms lead to different signals dependent
on sex is unknown. Further studies are needed to confirm this
association and explore the mechanism.
It is noteworthy that hypertensive patients appears to have
a higher risk of developing cancer, including lung cancer (41,
42). There’s a trend to develop cancer and hypertension with
aging. The increased levels of VEGF play a crucial role in
tumorigenesis (43).

from randomized trials demonstrated that a combination of an
ACEI and an ARB significantly increased the risk of cancer (4).
In another study, the increased risk of lung cancer was observed
in the patients who received ACEIs (relative risk 1.13; 95%
CI: 1.06–1.20) (25). According to a cohort study that included
992,061 participants who took antihypertensive drugs in the UK,
the use of ACEIs was associated with an increased risk of lung
cancer (incidence rate of 1.6/1,000 person-years; hazard ratio
1.14, 95% CI: 1.01–1.29). The correlation manifested stronger
among patients taking ACEIs for more than 5 years in further
analysis (7). Our study results are in accord with these metaanalyses and observational studies, although the absolute risk
increase is modest.
Sensitivity analysis indicated the robustness of our results,
conducted by restricting to specific values: subjects without
non-small lung cancer, subjects with diabetes, and the years
and region. Epidemiologic evidence shows that diabetes is
strongly associated with cancer incidence (26). As one of the
representatives’ of ARBs, irbesartan was chosen as the control
drug. The results demonstrated no significant lung cancer signals
in the irbesartan group (ROR: 0.98, 95% CI: 0.75–1.28; IC:
−0.03, 95% CI: −0.40 to 0.35), similar with the previous
research (24). Although the potential mechanism of ACEIinduced lung cancer is unclear; several plausible possibilities have
been raised. The use of ACEIs results in the accumulation of
bradykinin in the lungs. Bradykinin, as an active vasodilator,

between ACEI regimens and lung cancer, which provides clues
for pharmacoepidemiological studies for further evaluating
the causal relationship between a signal and ACEI-associated
lung cancer.

The data mining of the FAERS database is considered a
valuable tool; however, this study has several limitations. First,
this study fails to evaluate the causal relationship. Due to some
inherent limitations of SRSs (44), it is a reasonably descriptive
study applying the data-mining technique to identify potential
significant drug/event combinations highlighting combinations
that need further clinical validation. Second, the incompleteness
of data in the FAERS dataset does not allow for extensive analysis
of the potential effect of demographics, duration of use, and
dosage strengths that might affect the association between ACEIs
and lung cancer. Third, a detection bias may exist because
patients with intolerable cough due to ACEIs may receive more
chest examinations, leading to an increased probability of an
early diagnosis of lung cancer. Therefore, causality cannot be
confirmed based on the FAERS data alone. Notwithstanding
these limitations, our analysis has important strengths. First,
our study is the first to attempt to investigate the potential link
between the use of ACEI and lung cancer by using the FAERS
database. FAERS is the largest publicly available SRS, which
contains data of unselected real-world patients globally, which
has been collected for decades. Second, the study offers a unique
opportunity to detect and reevaluate, in a timely and inexpensive
manner, the risk-benefit profile of drugs, which is different
from clinical trials to assess drug safety. Third, to minimize the
reporting bias, sensitive analysis restricting the reporting region,
comorbidity, and reporting year was conducted. We performed
both the ROR and IC algorithms in the FAERS database analysis
and detected reliable signals.
Because of contradictory evidence from clinical trials, the
association between ACEIs and lung cancer remains unclear.
In the present study, the debate was further investigated
by new insights gained from pharmacovigilance. While
pharmacovigilance studies using the FAERS database have
limitations, as mentioned above, they can identify signals

CONCLUSIONS
Our analysis finds an association between ACEIs and primary
malignant lung cancer risk. The risk is higher in female patients
than in male patients.
