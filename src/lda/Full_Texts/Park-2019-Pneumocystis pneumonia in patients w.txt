sulfamethoxazole

Abstract
Objectives: To investigate the incidence of pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) and its risk factors in patients with
rheumatic disease receiving non-high-dose steroid treatment, along with the risks and benefits of PCP prophylaxis.
Methods: This study included 28,292 treatment episodes with prolonged (≥ 4 weeks), non-high-dose steroids (low dose
[< 15 mg/day, n = 27,227] and medium dose [≥ 15 to < 30 mg/day, n = 1065], based on prednisone) over a 14-year
period. Risk factors for PCP and prophylactic effect of trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) were investigated if the
1-year incidence rate (IR) of PCP in each dose group was > 0.1/100 person-years. Cox regression with LASSO was used for
analysis.
Results: One-year PCP IR in the low-dose group was 0.01 (95% CI 0.001–0.03)/100 person-years, and only the mediumdose group showed eligible PCP IR for further analysis. In the medium-dose group, prophylactic TMP-SMX was
administered in 45 treatment episodes while other episodes involved no prophylaxis (prophylaxis group vs. control
group). In 1018.0 person-years, 5 PCP cases occurred exclusively in the control group, yielding an IR of 0.5 (0.2–1.2)/100
person-years. Concomitant steroid-pulse treatment and baseline lymphopenia were the most significant risk factors for
PCP. Treatment episodes with at least one of these factors (n = 173, high-risk subgroup) showed higher 1-year PCP IR (3.4
(1.1–8.0)/100 person-years), while no PCP occurred in other treatment episodes. TMP-SMX numerically reduced the risk
(adjusted HR = 0.2 (0.001–2.3)) in the high-risk subgroup. The IR of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) related to TMP-SMX was
41.5 (22.3–71.6)/100 person-years, including one serious ADR. The number needed to treat with TMP-SMX to prevent one
PCP in the high-risk subgroup (31 (17–226)) was lower than the number needed to harm by serious ADR (45 (15–∞)).
Conclusion: Incidence of PCP in patients with rheumatic diseases receiving prolonged, medium-dose steroids depends
on the presence of risk factors. Prophylactic TMP-SMX may have greater benefit than potential risk in the high-risk
subgroup.

Background
Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) is a potentially lifethreatening infectious disease that mainly occurs in immunocompromised hosts [1]. PCP was first recognized
as the most common opportunistic infection in patients
infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), but
its incidence has fallen dramatically since the development of effective anti-retroviral treatment [2]. However,
PCP is still an important cause of atypical pneumonia in
patients without HIV who have immunosuppressed conditions [3, 4].
Incidence of PCP in patients with rheumatic diseases
remains uncertain. Previous study reported that its
prevalence in autoimmune diseases was 1~7% in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), 2~37.5% in inflammatory myositis, and 6~17% in Wegener’s granulomatosis
[5]. The broad range of prevalence among studies suggests that incidence of PCP could be different according
to immunosuppressant use. However, all of these studies
consistently reported high PCP-related mortality, which
spanned between 30 and 80%. Considering that PCP in
patients without HIV usually follows a fulminant course
and has higher mortality than PCP in HIV-infected patients, evidence on incidence and efficacy of primary
prophylaxis of PCP is required for better treatment outcome of rheumatic diseases [6–9].
The most significant risk factor for PCP in patients
without HIV is treatment with a moderate-to-high dose
of glucocorticoid, which is the principal therapeutic
agent for many rheumatic diseases [6, 10]. We previously
demonstrated that prophylactic trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) significantly decreases the incidence of PCP in patients with rheumatic diseases who
receive prolonged (≥ 4 weeks), high-dose (≥ 30 mg/day
prednisone) steroid treatment, with an acceptable safety
profile [11]. However, it is still uncertain whether
prophylaxis is justified in patients who receive lower
doses of glucocorticoid treatment. The incidence of PCP
and its potential risk factors have not been adequately
characterized in this group of patients, and reports have
been limited to small case series and observational studies [12–15].
The main objective of this study was to identify the
risk factors which primary PCP prophylaxis is justified
despite relatively lower dose of steroid treatment. We
determined the incidence of PCP in patients with
rheumatic diseases receiving various doses of steroids
for ≥ 4 weeks and investigated the clinical features that
affected the incidence of PCP.
Methods
Patients and treatment episodes

The electronic medical database at Seoul National University Hospital was analyzed for data collection and

Page 2 of 10

capturing study population. The institute is one of the
largest tertiary referral centers in South Korea and
covers patients living in all geographic areas of the country. The database was reviewed for the period between
January 2004 and December 2017 to capture the “treatment episode,” which was defined as a clinical situation
where a patient received steroid treatment within a specific dose range for ≥ 4 consecutive weeks. First, we collected the entire prescription data of oral/IV steroids.
Then, according to the initial 4-week dose of steroid and
prednisone-equivalent dose conversions, ≥ 2.5 to < 15
mg/day was defined as low dose, ≥ 15 to < 30 mg/day as
medium dose, and ≥ 30 mg/day as high dose. The definition was based on the degree of steroid receptor saturation and previous studies reporting PCP cases in
patients with steroid treatment [6, 10, 12, 16, 17]. All
captured episodes were then linked to the database of
registered ICD-10 code of all patients in our institution.
If a patient had more than one ICD-10 codes of rheumatic diseases, the patient’s medical records were reviewed
to confirm the diagnostic code.
The starting date of each treatment episode was defined as the first day of particular dose of steroid treatment. The observation period following each treatment
episode was 1 year, unless PCP or a censoring event
(death or loss to follow-up) occurred. To enable precise
determination of the effect of initial steroid treatment,
multiple episodes in a single patient had to be spaced ≥
1 year apart to be included in the study. Defining process
of treatment episodes is summarized in Additional file 1:
Figure S1. Patients with a history of PCP, HIV infection,
current cancer, or a solid organ transplant, and those <
18 years old, were excluded. The ICD-10 codes for case
identification are presented as Additional file 1.
Incidence of PCP in each dose group was determined,
and the values were compared. If the incidence rate (IR)
was < 0.1 per 100 person-years, the risk from PCP
prophylaxis (previously calculated as the incidence of
serious adverse drug reaction (ADR) related to TMPSMX) [11] was considered to clearly outweigh any potential benefit. Therefore, the efficacy of primary PCP
prophylaxis was only assessed for PCP IR ≥ 0.1 per 100
person-years. PCP IR in the high-dose group was used
for only comparison with that in each non-high-dose
group.
Treatment episodes in the eligible dose group were
classified into two groups (control or prophylaxis group)
according to whether a patient received primary PCP
prophylaxis concomitant with initiation of glucocorticoid
treatment. The baseline date was the first day of specific
dose of glucocorticoid treatment (control group) or
TMP-SMX (prophylaxis group). Each patient received
the corresponding dose of steroid for ≥ 4 weeks from the
baseline date.

The primary outcome was the 1-year incidence of PCP
in each group. Secondary outcome was the incidence of
ADRs related to the prophylaxis. All suspected ADRs
were reviewed by two authors (JWP and MJK) and
assigned a probability of causation based on their timing
compared with established patterns of specific ADRs.
Among them, only those with probable/likely or certain
causality were finally selected [18].
The study was carried out in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the institutional review board (IRB) of Seoul National University
Hospital [IRB No 0907-062-287]. Consent was waived by
the IRB because of the retrospective nature of the study.
Detection of clinically relevant PCP

An algorithm was constructed to enable detection of
symptomatic PCP occurring during the observation
period in patients with rheumatic disease (Additional file 1: Figure S2). All data for confirmatory microbiological tests for PCP (polymerase chain reaction and
direct fluorescent antibody staining of induced sputum
or bronchoalveolar lavage fluid) conducted from January
2004 to December 2017 were obtained from medical records. Medical records of patients with positive test results were further evaluated to ascertain whether they
had clinical features of PCP infection. All diagnoses of
PCP were confirmed based on (1) positive PCR and/or
immunofluorescence result of induced sputum or bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, (2) whether the patient showed
appropriate clinical features of PCP (acute onset of dyspnea, cough, or fever, along with characteristic radiographic findings), and (3) exclusion of other pulmonary
infections. Characteristic radiographic findings of PCP
were bilateral interstitial infiltrates, predominant in the
perihilar regions and the apices [19]. If a patient showed
typical manifestations suggesting PCP but chest radiographs were inconclusive, high-resolution computerized
tomography (HRCT) was evaluated to confirm the diagnosis. Positive microbiological tests without clinical
manifestations consistent with respiratory infection were
not considered to indicate PCP.
PCP prophylaxis

TMP-SMX was the only agent used for PCP prophylaxis
in this study. Because there was no consensus regarding
PCP prophylaxis in patients with rheumatic disease receiving steroid treatment, initiation and duration of
prophylaxis was mainly determined by physicians’ judgment. In the prophylaxis group, patients started TMPSMX concurrently with steroid treatment unless they
had contraindications for use of TMP-SMX at this time.
TMP-SMX was given as one single-strength tablet (400/
80 mg) per day, and the dose was adjusted according to
the patient’s creatinine clearance (one tablet three times

Page 3 of 10

weekly when creatinine clearance 15~30 mL/min).
Second-line prophylactic agents such as dapsone, atovaquone, and aerosolized pentamidine were not used for
primary prophylaxis against PCP during the observation
period.
Statistical analysis

Continuous and dichotomous variables were analyzed
using Student’s t test and the chi-square test, respectively. The Cox proportional-hazards regression model
was used for comparison of the incidence of PCP between the groups and for estimation of effects of clinical
factors on the 1-year PCP incidence. The hazard ratio
(HR) was adjusted for baseline clinical factors that
showed a relevant association (p < 0.1) with outcome. If
an outcome variable showed a complete separation,
Firth’s penalized maximum likelihood was used for reduction of statistical bias [20]. In addition, the final
model was adjusted for intra-cluster correlation using
grouped sandwich variance estimates, as some patients
may have undergone multiple treatment episodes. To
define the high-risk subgroup for PCP, a penalized regression method with the least absolute shrinkage and
selection operator (LASSO) was used to select variables
that predict the outcome most precisely. Briefly, among
the nine variables (age, sex, disease duration, initial steroid dose, concomitant cyclophosphamide treatment,
high cumulative steroid use, interstitial lung disease,
lymphopenia, and concomitant steroid pulse) potentially
associated with PCP, cross-validation was used to find
the model with the minimal value for tuning parameter
lambda. Because all clinical variables used for analysis
had less than 1% of missing data, all statistical analyses
were performed without imputation of them.
All statistical analyses were performed using R 3.3.1 software (package glmnet for Cox regression with LASSO), and
a p value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Results
Incidence of PCP with different steroid treatment doses

A total of 28,292 treatment episodes with non-high-dose
steroid (27,227 low-dose group and 1065 medium-dose
group) and 1665 episodes with high-dose steroid were
initially analyzed. The 1-year IR of PCP increased progressively with increasing daily steroid dose (Fig. 1). In
the treatment episodes with < 15 mg/day prednisone or
equivalent, the IR was much lower than the pre-defined
threshold value of 0.1 per 100 person-years. Therefore,
the efficacy of TMP-SMX for primary PCP prophylaxis
was only assessed in the medium-dose group.

Fig. 1 The 1-year incidence rates of pneumocystis pneumonia in treatment episodes with various ranges of steroid doses. Notably, the incidence
was considerably higher for daily doses of steroids ≥ 15 mg of prednisone or equivalent. Error bar indicates the upper margin of the 95%
confidence interval of the incidence rate

fulfilled the criteria for analysis (Additional file 1: Figure
S3). Baseline characteristics for this group are shown in
Table 1. In this cohort, SLE was the most common disease (44.4%), followed by Behcet’s disease (19.7%). In the
89 (8.4%) treatment episodes, patient had interstitial
lung disease (ILD) proven in chest computerized tomography. Concomitant steroid-pulse treatment at baseline
was performed in 5.1% of the cohort. In the 83 (7.8%)
treatment episodes, observation was censored because of
follow-up loss (n = 66), death (n = 12), or PCP (n = 5).
TMP-SMX prophylaxis was performed in 45 (4.2%)
treatment episodes, with a mean (SD) duration of 290
(275) days. Renal dose adjustment of TMP-SMX was
performed in 7 episodes. Prophylaxis was initiated at the
same time as the steroid treatment in 43 episodes, and
in 2 episodes, the intended TMP-SMX initiation was delayed for 2 days for a missed prescription and for 19 days
for leukopenia. Baseline characteristics of the control
and prophylaxis groups differed significantly for several
variables (Table 1). Patients in the prophylaxis group
were more likely to have dermatomyositis, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, or microscopic polyangiitis and less
frequently had Behcet’s disease. Concomitant steroid
pulse (250~1000 mg/day methylprednisolone for 1~3
days) and cyclophosphamide were used more frequently
in the prophylaxis group. However, the mean cumulative
steroid dose administered during the entire observation
period was comparable between the two groups (prednisone equivalent, 4385.0 ± 2037.1 vs. 4405.7 ± 2337.8

mg, p = 0.947). In contrast, mycophenolate mofetil
(MMF) and methotrexate (MTX) were more frequently
used in the control group. Other immunosuppressive
agents such as azathioprine, cyclosporine, and tumor necrosis factor inhibitor (TNFi) were comparably used between the two groups. The proportion of treatment
episode with baseline ILD was also higher in the prophylaxis group (7.1% vs. 37.8%).

Incidence of PCP and risk factors in the medium-dose
group

During a total of 1018.0 person-years, five PCP cases occurred, giving an IR of 0.5 (95% CI, 0.2–1.2) per 100
person-years. Clinical features of each PCP case at baseline and at the time of PCP diagnosis are presented in
Additional file 1: Table S1. All cases occurred in the
control group within the first 6 months of the observation period, and two individuals died as a result of PCP.
The results of univariable Cox regression analysis
showed that concomitant steroid pulse at baseline was
the most significant risk factor for PCP (HR = 75.0; 95%
CI, 8.4–671.4). Baseline lymphopenia (< 800 lymphocytes/μL) and concomitant cyclophosphamide treatment
(oral or intravenous) were also risk factors for PCP. High
cumulative steroid (≥ 900 mg of prednisone or equivalent
in the 6 months prior to the baseline date) was associated with increased risk for PCP, although it was not statistically significant (p = 0.084).

In the multivariable analysis where these clinical factors
were included as covariates, only concomitant steroid-pulse
treatment and baseline lymphopenia were significantly associated with the incidence of PCP (Table 2). Model selection using LASSO regression also demonstrated that the
model including steroid pulse and lymphopenia was the
best model for precise prediction of PCP occurrence in the
medium-dose population (Additional file 1: Figure S4). On
the basis of these results, 173 treatment episodes where the
patient had lymphopenia and/or had received concomitant
steroid-pulse treatment were classified as a high-risk subgroup. All treatment episodes in which PCP occurred were
in this subgroup. The 1-year IR for PCP in the high-risk
subgroup was 3.4 (95% CI, 1.1–8.0) per 100 person-years,
which was significantly higher than that in the remaining
treatment episodes (HR = 56.5; 95% profile likelihood CI,
6.4–7423.8). It was also comparable to that in the highdose group (Fig. 2).
Efficacy of TMP-SMX prophylaxis

The results of the Cox proportional hazard model in the
medium-dose group indicated that TMP-SMX prophylaxis did not significantly decrease the 1-year PCP IR (adjusted HR = 0.5; 95% profile likelihood CI, 0.004–5.3).
However, in the high-risk subgroup, TMP-SMX numerically reduced the 1-year PCP IR, although this effect was
not statistically significant (adjusted HR = 0.18; 95% profile
likelihood CI, 0.001–2.3) (Table 3). To investigate other
populations in which PCP prophylaxis might be beneficial,
the effect of TMP-SMX on 1-year PCP IR was estimated
in specific subgroups. However, none of the subgroup

analyses showed a significant decrease in PCP IR in association with prophylaxis (Additional file 1: Table S2).

Safety and risk–benefit assessment of prophylactic TMPSMX

During the 35.8 person-years of TMP-SMX prophylaxis
(in 45 treatment episodes), 12 ADRs occurred in 10
treatment episodes, with an IR of 33.5 (95% CI, 17.3–
58.5) per 100 person-years (Table 4). Abnormal results
in liver function tests were the most common ADR, with
an IR of 8.4 (95% CI, 1.7–24.5 per 100 person-years),
followed by skin rash and thrombocytopenia, both with
an IR of 5.6 (95% CI, 0.7–20.2) per 100 person-years.
Most ADRs showed mild-to-moderate severity (11/12,
91.7%), but TMP-SMX was withdrawn in nine treatment
episodes by the treating physician. One serious ADR occurred in the non-high-risk subgroup with a hospitalization
for pancytopenia, which rapidly improved after discontinuation of TMP-SMX. No significant difference was observed
in the incidence of ADR according to the underlying
rheumatic disease (data not shown).
On the basis of the one case of serious ADR in the
prophylaxis group, the number needed to harm
(NNH) was 45 (95% CI, 15 to ∞ [95% CI of absolute
risk increasing was − 2.1 to 6.5]). In the whole population in the medium-steroid-dose group, the number
needed to treat (NNT) with TMP-SMX to prevent
one case of PCP was 204 (95% CI, 109–1624). However, in the high-risk subgroup, the NNT was 31
(95% CI, 17–226).

Discussion
Glucocorticoid treatment is an essential part of the
therapy for many rheumatic diseases, but is also an
important risk factor for PCP. The association of high
mortality with PCP means that a universal recommendation regarding PCP prophylaxis is important for
the improvement of treatment outcomes, and this
goal requires the establishment of an evidence-based
threshold for the commencement of prophylaxis. To
the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to
investigate the incidence of PCP and its risk factors
in patients with rheumatic diseases who received

prolonged, medium-dose steroid treatment (≥ 15 to <
30 mg/day prednisone or equivalent).
In this study, the 1-year IR of PCP in the medium-dose
group was 0.5 per 100 person-years, which was prominently lower than that in the high-dose group. However,
the IR of PCP was highly variable and was affected by
whether a patient had lymphopenia and/or had received
concomitant steroid-pulse treatment at baseline. No PCP
cases were associated with treatment episodes without
these risk factors, suggesting that prolonged, mediumdose steroid treatment alone does not lead to sufficient
immunosuppression for the occurrence of PCP. Previous

experimental data have also demonstrated that mediumdose steroid treatment (unlike high-dose treatment) does
not fully saturate the glucocorticoid receptor which leads
to immunosuppression by genomic effect [16, 21, 22]. In
addition, the most previously reported cases of PCP in patients without high doses of steroids were associated with
other immunosuppressive conditions, such as lymphopenia, or with the concomitant use of other immunosuppressants [12, 23–25]. Taken together, our results suggest
that a prolonged (≥ 4 weeks), 30-mg/day dosage of prednisone (or equivalent) is a relevant threshold for justification of PCP prophylaxis in patients with rheumatic disease
who do not have any other risk factors.
Notably, our results demonstrated that treatment episodes
for patients receiving prolonged medium-dose glucocorticoids with at least one risk factor (in particular, concomitant
steroid pulse) were associated with a comparable PCP incidence to that in the high-dose group. This result was
contrary to that of our previous study, in which steroidpulse treatment did not increase the risk of PCP in patients
receiving prolonged high-dose steroids [11]. Results from
previous studies of PCP in patients with rheumatic diseases
showed that it usually occurs after > 4 weeks of steroid treatment [6, 25, 26], suggesting that both duration and dose of
the steroid treatment are important predisposing factors for
PCP occurrence. Therefore, pulse treatment could increase
the risk of PCP by a different mechanism from that of prolonged high-dose steroid treatment. This mechanism might
involve acute immunosuppression and subsequent rapid immune reconstitution after the pulse treatment [27]. It is also
supported by some previous reports showing that rapid reduction of immunosuppressive agents is significantly associated with PCP in patients without HIV [9, 28, 29].
In the current study, PCP incidence in the high-risk subgroup was comparable to that in the high-dose group, but

TMP-SMX prophylaxis did not significantly reduce the 1year PCP incidence. The number of treatment episodes with
prophylaxis in the high-risk subgroup was small (n = 18), so
this study did not have adequate power to demonstrate efficacy of prophylaxis. However, in a risk–benefit assessment,
the NNT to prevent one case of PCP in the high-risk group
was numerically lower than the NNH for serious ADR. Although the NNH was calculated for the entire medium-dose
group (because the only serious ADR occurred in the nonhigh-risk subgroup), this result suggests that the clinical
benefit of prophylactic TMP-SMX could outweigh the risk
for serious ADR in high-risk patients. However, considering
the wide ranges of 95% CI of NNT and NNH, this result
should be replicated in the future studies.
It is also interesting that most ADRs related to TMPSMX had mild-to-moderate severity, but prophylaxis
was withdrawn in 75% of the episodes in which these
ADRs occurred. It could be attributed to the physicians’
concern for possible progression to serious ADR such as
Stevens–Johns syndrome. Results from previous studies
also have reported a high incidence of ADR related to
TMP-SMX, especially in patients with SLE [30, 31].
However, considering the high mortality associated with
PCP in patients with rheumatic diseases, risk–benefit
analysis of prophylaxis should be based not only on the
incidence of ADRs, but also on their severity.
Some limitations of this study should be considered.
First, the number of treatment episodes with prophylaxis
was too small to precisely estimate the prophylactic efficacy of TMP-SMX. It also led to wide 95% confidence
interval of both NNT and NNH, which make the result
less powered. Therefore, it should be confirmed in the
future studies including greater number of patients with
prophylaxis. However, our data clearly showed that PCP
did not occur despite large-scale observation in the

Park et al. Arthritis Research & Therapy

(2019) 21:207

treatment episodes where patients did not have risk factors. Second, although we defined the high-risk subgroups based on the LASSO selection method, it is
uncertain whether these criteria can be generalized in
other populations. Although all PCP cases occurred in
the high-risk subgroup, the predictive performance
should be validated in other populations. Third, because
this study was retrospective, patients in the prophylaxis
groups were more likely to have clinical factors that increase the risk for PCP (steroid pulse, interstitial lung
disease, and numerically high cumulative steroid use before the baseline), which could lead to a biased result.
However, this ‘confounding by indication’ biased away
the result from showing a protective effect so true
prophylaxis effect might be even better than estimated.
In addition, change in the immunosuppressant use during the observation could be also different between the
two groups. Although we showed that cumulative dose
of steroid treatment between the two groups was comparable, difference in other immunosuppressive agent
uses was not considered in the analysis. Finally, unmeasured confounders such as patients’ compliance cannot
be completely adjusted by statistical manipulation.

Conclusion
In conclusion, our results showed the IR of PCP in patients with rheumatic disease treated with various steroid
dosages, and proposed threshold for steroid treatment in
the presence or absence of other risk factors for which
primary PCP prophylaxis can be justified. Although this
result should be confirmed in future studies, it would be
an important basis for a universal guideline regarding
PCP prophylaxis in patients with rheumatic diseases.
