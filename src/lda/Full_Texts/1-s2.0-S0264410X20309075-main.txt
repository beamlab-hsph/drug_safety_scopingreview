Background: On 12/23/2009 a new high-dose trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV3-HD) was
licensed for adults aged 65 years. We assessed the post-licensure safety data for IIV3-HD in the
Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) during 2011–2019.
Methods: We searched VAERS for reports after IIV3-HD during 1/1/2011–06/30/2019 in persons
aged 65 years. Medical records were reviewed for all death reports and for certain pre-specified conditions (e.g. Guillain Barré Syndrome [GBS], anaphylaxis). We also reviewed certain groups who received
IIV3-HD erroneously (e.g. pregnant women, children). Empirical Bayesian data mining was used to identify disproportional reporting.
Results: VAERS received 12,320 reports after IIV3-HD;723 reports (5.9%) were serious. The most common
adverse events (AEs) among serious reports were pyrexia (30.2%), asthenia (28.9%), and dyspnea (24.9%),
and among non-serious reports were injection site erythema (16.8%), pain in extremity (15.8%), and injection site pain (14.2%). Among 55 death reports, the most common causes of death were diseases of the
circulatory system (n = 23;41.8%). Based on medical record review, there were 61 reports of GBS and
13 of anaphylaxis. There were 13 reports of pregnant-women who inadvertently received IIV3-HD; three
reports described arm pain or local reactions, and 10 did not report any AE. Among 59 reports of children
who erroneously received IIV3-HD, 31 experienced an AE (most commonly injection site or constitutional
reactions) and the remaining 28 reports did not describe any AE.
Conclusions: Post-licensure safety data of IIV3-HD during 9 influenza seasons revealed no new or unexpected safety concerns among individuals 65 years. Inadvertent administration of IIV3-HD to children
or pregnant women was observed, although with no serious AEs reported. Training and education of providers in vaccine recommendations and groups for whom the vaccine is indicated may help in preventing
these vaccine administration errors. This review provides baseline information for future monitoring of
the quadrivalent-high-dose influenza vaccine.

1. Introduction
Older adults are more vulnerable to infection with influenza,
and to subsequent influenza illness, hospitalization, and death,
[1] which may be due to decreased immunity and comorbid conditions [2]. Improving the efficacy of influenza vaccines in this population has been an active area of research [3]. A high dose
trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV3-HD) was licensed by

the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on December 23, 2009
[4,5]. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP)
has included the IIV3-HD formulation for adults aged  65 years
in its recommendations since the 2010–2011 influenza season
[1]. A previous post-licensure assessment of the safety of IIV3-HD
in the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) during its
first year after licensure did not reveal any new or unexpected
safety concern [6]. Adverse events reported were consistent
with injection site and constitutional reactions observed in
pre-licensure studies [4,7]. The current review describes the
post-licensure safety experience with IIV3-HD in VAERS during 9
influenza seasons since 2011.

2. Material and methods

2.3. Data mining

2.1. Vaers

We used empirical Bayesian (EB) data mining to identify AEs
that were reported more frequently than expected following
IIV3-HD compared to other vaccines in VAERS, adjusting for age,
sex, and the year in which reports were received [14]. We conducted the analyses using the Multi-Item Gamma Poisson Shrinker
(MGPS) algorithm [14,15] in Oracle’s EmpiricaTM Signal System. The
main statistical scores computed are EBGM, EB05, EB95, representing the Empirical Bayes Geometric Mean and the 90% confidence
interval. We used published criteria to identify AEs that were
reported at least twice as frequently as would be expected following IIV3-HD (i.e., lower bound of the 90% confidence interval surrounding the EB geometric mean [EB05] > 2) [15] For PTs with
elevated values, we clinically reviewed the VAERS reports. Elevated
data mining statistics should not be interpreted as evidence of causal relationship between a vaccine and an AE; vaccine-event combinations identified as potential signals by data mining methods
may be useful to generate hypothesis that can be tested with controlled studies [16,17].

VAERS is a U.S. national vaccine safety surveillance system
created in 1990 and co-administered by the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC) and FDA [8]. It receives spontaneous reports of adverse events (AEs) following vaccination.
Vaccination errors not describing an AE may also be reported
[9]. VAERS data generally cannot be used to assess whether an
AE is causally associated with vaccination, but may be useful
for detecting potential vaccine safety problems [8]. VAERS
accepts reports from healthcare providers, vaccine manufacturers, vaccine recipients, and other reporters. The VAERS report
form collects information on sex, age, vaccines administered,
dose and lot number, the AE experienced, and medical history.
Signs and symptoms of AEs are coded by trained personnel using
the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA), a
clinically validated, internationally standardized terminology
[10]. A VAERS report may be assigned one or more MedDRA Preferred Terms (PTs). A PT is a distinct descriptor for a symptom,
sign, disease, diagnosis, therapeutic indication, investigation, surgical, or medical procedure, or medical, social, or family history
characteristic [10], but PTs are not necessarily medically confirmed diagnoses. A report is considered serious based on the
Code of Federal Regulations (21-CFR) definition if one or more
of the following are reported: death, life-threatening illness, hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, congenital
anomaly, permanent disability, or medical intervention to prevent the aforementioned outcomes [11]. For non-manufacturer
serious reports, medical records are routinely requested and
made available to VAERS personnel.
We searched the VAERS database for reports after IIV3-HD for
persons given this vaccine from January 1, 2011 through June 30,
2019 (reports received by June 30, 2019). Non-U.S. reports were
excluded, and duplicate reports were consolidated. We summarized the most common MedDRA PTs for serious and non-serious
IIV3-HD reports and performed medical review for selected AEs,
as described in the following section.
To provide context for our findings, we asked Sanofi Pasteur, the
manufacturer of IIV3-HD, for permission to publicly disclose dose
distribution information.

2.2. Clinical review of serious reports
All death reports after IIV3-HD were manually reviewed by
physicians (PLM, EJW). The primary cause of death was obtained
from the autopsy report, death certificate, and/or medical
records. We also searched all reports and any available medical
records for the following pre-specified conditions or populations:
Guillain Barré Syndrome (GBS), anaphylaxis, pregnant women,
and children. Reports of GBS were identified using the following
MedDRA PTs: Guillain Barré Syndrome, Miller Fisher Syndrome,
and demyelinating polyneuropathy. Anaphylaxis reports were
identified using the following MedDRA PTs: anaphylactic reaction, anaphylactic shock, anaphylactoid reaction, and anaphylactoid shock. Reports of GBS and anaphylaxis were classified using
the Brighton Collaboration case definition, which uses three
levels of diagnostic certainty, or a physician’s diagnosis [12,13].
We searched for pregnancy reports by using a text string search
for ‘preg’ in the variables for symptom text, pre-existing conditions, and medical history. We identified pediatric cases based
on the age (18 years) reported on the VAERS form. In this
review, we made no attempt to assess causality of the reported
AEs.

3. Ethics
Because VAERS is a routine surveillance program designed to
improve an immunization program, it does not meet the definition
of research; therefore, this work was not subject to Institutional
Review Board evaluation and informed consent requirements.
4. Results
During the period of this review, VAERS received 12,320 reports
for IIV3-HD in adults aged  65 years; 723 reports (5.9%) were serious, including 55 deaths. Table 1 summarizes the demographic
characteristics, and Table 2 summarizes the most common MedDRA PTs. Females accounted for almost ¾ of all reports and the
most common PTs for serious and non-serious reports were pyrexia (30.2%) and injection site erythema (16.8%), respectively.
Through June 2019, 113.1 million doses of IIV3-HD have been
distributed (data shown with permission from Sanofi Pasteur).
4.1. Deaths
There were 55 deaths, with age ranging from 65 to 95 years
(median: 80 years); 21 were women (38%). On the whole, the
causes of death were typical for individuals in this age group
(Table 3). Cardiovascular conditions accounted for the largest cat-

4.3. Anaphylaxis
Thirty-nine reports had at least one PT suggestive of anaphylaxis (0.32%;39/12,320); 24 described likely or possible cases of
anaphylaxis. Based on review of medical records, 13 were verified
as anaphylaxis: Brighton level 1 (n = 7), Brighton level 2 (n = 1),
Brighton level 3 (n = 2), or a diagnosis of anaphylaxis by the
patient’s physician (n = 3). In 11 additional reports, the description
in the VAERS form suggested anaphylaxis, but medical records
were not available. Of these 24 cases of likely or possible anaphylaxis, 18 received IIV3-HD as the only vaccine. Fifteen reports
described allergic reactions that were not anaphylaxis.

10 did not report any AE. None of the reports described any adverse
effects affecting the pregnancy itself.

egory, followed by respiratory diseases, infection/sepsis, and

4.2. Guillain-Barré Syndrome
Sixty-nine reports of GBS after IIV3-HD were reported to VAERS
(0.6%; 69/12,320). Sixty-one met Brighton criteria or were
considered as GBS by the attending physician. The onset interval
was 0–42 days following vaccination in 52 of the 61 reports for

Fifty-nine reports stated that an individual < 18 years had inadvertently received IIV3-HD. Thirty-one reports described AEs,
including: injection site reactions or arm pain (n = 12), constitutional symptoms (n = 4), non-anaphylaxis allergic reactions
(n = 2), gastrointestinal symptoms (n = 3), and one report each of
febrile seizures, post viral cerebellitis, upper leg/knee swelling,
acute kidney injury, hypotonia, opening mouth as if to scream, difficulty breathing, shaking uncontrollably, torticollis, and autism/
speech regression. Twenty-eight reports did not describe an AE.
5. Discussion
We conducted a review of AEs after IIV3-HD reported to VAERS
during 9 influenza seasons. Our review included automated analyses of all reports, and clinical review of all death reports and prespecified conditions (GBS, anaphylaxis). We also analyzed certain
groups of interest for whom this vaccine is not recommended
(pregnant women and children) but who received the vaccine in
error. Our findings were consistent with those from pre-licensure
studies [4] and an initial post-licensure study of the VAERS database during its first season on the market [6]. The most common
PTs observed among serious and non-serious reports were constitutional (e.g. fever, asthenia) and injection site reactions (e.g.,
injection site erythema, injection site pain), respectively, which
are findings consistent with those from pre-licensure clinical trials
[4].
Among death reports for which sufficient records were available for review, the leading causes of death were diseases of the
circulatory system (e.g. coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction), respiratory conditions (e.g., chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease), and sepsis, all of which are consistent with leading causes
of death in older adults in the US [18].
Anaphylaxis is an acute hypersensitivity reaction that involves
the release of mediators from mast cells, basophils and recruited
inflammatory cells [19]. It involves multiple organ systems
and can present with variable severity, ranging from mild to

5926

P.L. Moro et al. / Vaccine 38 (2020) 5923–5926

life-threatening [19]. Anaphylaxis is a rare adverse event after
vaccination and its incidence after IIV3 vaccination was recently
estimated to be 1.6 per million doses distributed among all ages
[20]. Our finding of 13 reports of verified anaphylaxis after
IIV3-HD is consistent with the rarity of this event after vaccination
with other influenza vaccines.
Guillain Barré Syndrome (GBS) is an acute, immune-mediated
paralytic disorder of the peripheral nervous system [21]. The background incidence of GBS varies and is higher with increasing age
[22]. Among persons aged 80–89 years it has been reported at
2.66 cases per 100,00 person-years [22]. Although very rare, an
increased risk of GBS was observed following vaccination with
the 1976–1977 A/New Jersey (‘‘swine influenza”) vaccine [23]. In
our review of 9 years of data for IIV3-HD, GBS was confirmed in
61 cases. For 52 of these cases, the onset was within 42 days of vaccination, the window of biological plausibility if an association
with vaccination is suspected. However, during the time period
of our study 113 million doses of IIV3-HD vaccine had been distributed, and our data mining analysis did not show disproportionate reporting for GBS.
Vaccination errors involving pregnant women and children
were reported to VAERS but no concerning pattern of AEs was
observed in these groups. Most of the reports did not describe an
AE, and if one was present it was typically mild and non-serious.
However, these findings highlight the need to provide education
and training to providers on ACIP recommendations and package
insert indications to help prevent these errors.
Strengths of VAERS include its broad national scope and timeliness [8]. VAERS may be particularly useful for detecting potential
safety signals which can be further evaluated in larger datasets
using controlled epidemiological methodologies [24]. As a passive
surveillance system, VAERS has several inherent limitations which
call for careful interpretation of its findings. Some of these limitations include over- or under-reporting, biased reporting, and
inconsistency in quality and completeness of reports [8]. VAERS
data generally cannot be used to assess if a vaccine caused an AE.
VAERS does not collect data on number of vaccinees, therefore, it
does not provide denominator data to calculate incidence rates of
AEs.
6. Conclusion
Our assessment of post-licensure safety data for IIV3-HD did
not identify any new or unexpected safety issues and is consistent
with pre-licensure studies. With the introduction of quadrivalent
high-dose influenza vaccine (IIV4-HD) [25], the information from
this review may serve as a baseline for monitoring post-licensure
safety of the new vaccine.
