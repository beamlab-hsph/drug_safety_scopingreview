Background: Although colitis has been reported in patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs),
associations between colitis and ICIs had not been thoroughly assessed in real-world studies. Here, we identiﬁed
and characterized signiﬁcant colitis-associated with ICIs.
Methods: Based on the Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) from January
2004 to December 2019, the disproportionality analysis and Bayesian analysis, including the reporting odds
ratio (ROR), the proportional reporting ratio (PRR), the Bayesian conﬁdence propagation neural network
(BCPNN) and the multi-item gamma Poisson shrinker (MGPS) algorithms were adopted to data mining of the
suspected adverse events of colitis after ICIs administrating. Clinical characteristics of patients with ICIs-associated colitis and the time to onset of colitis following diﬀerent ICI regimens were collected.
Results: A total of 3786 reports of colitis adverse events were identiﬁed with ICIs. Seven ICI monotherapies were
associated with the reporting of colitis. Statistically signiﬁcant ROR, PRR, information component (IC), and
empirical Bayesian geometric mean (EBGM) emerged for all ICI monotherapies and combination therapies. ICIsassociated colitis aﬀected mostly male (53.51%), with a wide mean age range (60.65 to 72 years). Colitis adverse
events were commonly reported in patients with melanoma and lung cancer. Adverse outcomes of colitis concerning ICI were mainly outcomes of hospitalization-initiated or prolonged and other serious. Among colitis
cases, 17.43% cases of colitis concerning ICI lead to death. The adverse event of colitis occurred earliest in
ipilimumab monotherapy with a median time to onset of 64.21 days (IQR: 27–69 days) among all monotherapies.
Conclusions: ICI may lead to severe and disabling ICIs-associated colitis during therapy. Analysis of FAERS data
identiﬁed signals for adverse events of colitis with ICI regimens. Practitioners should consider the factors that
may increase the likelihood of colitis. The ﬁndings support a continued surveillance and risk factor identiﬁcation
studies.

1. Introduction
The introduction of immune checkpoint immunotherapies in recent
years constitutes a major breakthrough in the treatment of advanced

melanoma and other metastatic cancers [1,2]. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) represent the cornerstone of these novel targeted approaches. ICIs are monoclonal antibodies which target down-regulators
of the anti-cancer immune response, including cytotoxic T-lymphocyte

inﬂammatory bowel disease (10021972), sigmoidoscopy abnormal
(10040670), necrotising colitis (10051606), colitis microscopic
(10056979), eosinophilic colitis (10057271), colitis erosive
(10058358), biopsy intestine abnormal (10058371), and acute haemorrhagic ulcerative colitis (10075634). The drugs in the FAERS database can be registered arbitrarily; therefore, the MICROMEDEX®
(Index Nominum) was utilized as a dictionary. ICIs were deﬁned as both
brand and generic names in the DRUG ﬁle, and choose the role_cod as
“PS” (Primary suspected).

antigen 4 (CTLA-4), programmed cell death 1 (PD-1), and programmed
cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) [3]. From 2011 to 2018, seven ICIs were
approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Ipilimumab
binds to CTLA-4 is the ﬁrst ICI approved by the FDA for the treatment of
melanoma [4]. Others were respectively PD-1 inhibitors (nivolumab,
pembrolizumab, and cemiplimab), and PD-L1 inhibitors (atezolizumab,
avelumab, and durvalumab) (Supplementary Table 1) [1,5]. Numerous
clinical trials on novel ICIs and ICI combinations are still actively ongoing [6–8].
ICIs have represented a remarkable breakthrough in the treatment
of several advanced malignancies. Despite favorable beneﬁts of ICIs,
many immune-related adverse events (irAEs) have been described
which mainly involving gut, skin, endocrine glands, liver, and lung,
with a potential eﬀect on any other tissues [9,10]. Increasing evidences
indicate that ICIs might bring up a potential risk of colitis [11,12].
Colitis following the use of ICIs, mainly when these agents are used in
combination, may result in poor outcomes, ranging from mild selflimiting to severe life-threatening disease, and increases the risk of
other complications, including ileus, colonic distension, and toxic
megacolon, intestinal perforation, or even death, which potentially
limit the use of this combination [13,14]. However, most evidence of
ICIs-associated colitis came from case reports and clinical trials. With
the increasing varieties and indications of ICIs, it is necessary to timely
update the understanding and provide an overview of the risk and
characteristics of colitis adverse events for further prevention and
management.
Data-mining techniques are increasingly employed to explore and
analyze large volumes of accumulated data from medical databases to
identify potential associations between drugs and adverse events
[15,16]. The Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting
System (FAERS) is a public, voluntary, spontaneous reporting database
that provides information on adverse events and medication error reports designed to support FDA post-marketing safety surveillance program for approved drugs and biologics [17]. Herein, this pharmacovigilance study aimed to use the FAERS database to characterize further
the proﬁle of treatments with ICI regimens in relation to colitis from
multiple details in a large real-world patient population.

2.3. Data mining
Disproportionality analysis compares the proportion of selected
speciﬁc adverse-drug-reaction reported for a single or a combination of
ICIs, with the proportion of the same adverse-drug-reaction reported for
the full database. Based on the disproportionality analysis and Bayesian
analysis, the reporting odds ratio (ROR), the proportional reporting
ratio (PRR), the Bayesian conﬁdence propagation neural network
(BCPNN) and the multi-item gamma Poisson shrinker (MGPS) algorithms were employed to identify an association between a drug and an
adverse event. The equations and criteria for the four algorithms
[18–26] are shown in Supplementary Table 2. These algorithms extract
decision rules for signal detection and/or calculating scores to measure
associations between drugs and adverse events. One of the four algorithm meets the criteria should be considered as a positive signal of
colitis.
The time to onset of colitis was evaluated for each ICI regimen. It
was deﬁned as the interval between the EVENT_DT (adverse event onset
date) and the START_DT (start date of ICI use). However, reports with
input errors (EVENT_DT earlier than START_DT) or inaccurate date
entry were excluded. Also, reports with fatal events attributed to drug
toxicity were counted, and the fatality was calculated as the number of
fatal events divided by the total number of events of colitis-associated
with each ICI regimen.
2.4. Statistical analysis
Descriptive analyses were utilized to summarize the clinical characteristics of the patients with ICI-associated colitis collected from the
FAERS database. The time to onset of ICI-associated colitis was compared between diﬀerent ICI regimens using the Kruskal-Wallis test and
Dunn's multiple comparisons test. Fatality were compared between
diﬀerent ICI regimens using Pearson's chi-square test or Fisher exact
test. p < 0.05 with 95% conﬁdence intervals was indicated as a statistical signiﬁcance. All statistical analyses were performed with
GraphPad Prism 8 (GraphPad Software, CA, USA).

2. Methods
2.1. Data source
A retrospective pharmacovigilance study was performed using the
data retrieved in the FAERS database from January 2004 to December
2019. FAERS data ﬁles contain demographic and administrative information (DEMO), drug information (DRUG), the Medical Dictionary
for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) preferred terms (PTs) coded for the
adverse event (REAC), patient outcomes (OUTC), report sources
(RPSR), therapy start dates and end dates for reported drugs (THER),
indications for use (INDI), and deleted cases.
In total, 13,649,428 reports were retrieved from the FAERS database. Removed data from the deleted ﬁle followed a deduplication
procedure was performed according to the FDA’s recommendations,
selecting the latest FDA_DT when the CASEIDs were the same and selecting the higher PRIMARYID when the CASEID and FDA_DT were the
same, resulting in a reduction in the number of reports to 11,457,044.

3. Results
3.1. Disproportionality analysis and Bayesian analysis
From January 2004 to December 2019, 72,172 adverse events related to ICIs and 113,513 reports related to colitis were documented in
the FAERS database were documented in the FAERS database. A total of
3,786 cases of colitis induced by ICIs as the suspected drug were
identiﬁed. Colitis signals were detected for seven ICI monotherapies
and two ICI combination therapies based on the criteria for the four
algorithms. No cases were reported for other combination therapies of
anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1/PD-L1. As shown in Table 1, statistically
signiﬁcant ROR, PRR, information component (IC), and empirical
Bayesian geometric mean (EBGM) emerged for all ICI monotherapies
and combination therapies.

2.2. Adverse event and drug identiﬁcation
Adverse events were investigated using the MedDRA (Version 23.0)
Preferred Term “colitis” in the REAC ﬁles. We built the PTs search
strategy as follow: biopsy colon abnormal (10004760), colitis
(10009887), colitis ischaemic (10009895), colitis ulcerative
(10009900), colon gangrene (10009971), colonoscopy abnormal
(10010008), crohn's disease (10011401), enteritis (10014866), enterocolitis (10014893), enterocolitis haemorrhagic (10014896),

FAERS pharmacovigilance database from January 2004 to December
2019. In the meanwhile, it is the ﬁrst study to describe the associations,
timing, and prognosis of colitis following the use of ICI regimens. We
identiﬁed and characterized signiﬁcant colitis-associated with ICIs. The
study showed that ICI monotherapies and combination therapies were
associated with adverse events of colitis. Our analysis of the FAERS
database identiﬁed signals for colitis-associated with ICI regimens.
Several pharmacovigilance studies [3,17,27–30] of ICIs conﬁrm that
ICIs lead to severe and disabling irAEs during monotherapy or combination therapy, so irAEs caused by ICIs need to be notably concerned.
The recognition of ICIs-induced colitis is increasing with the extensive
use of ICIs in the past few years. The variable incidence of immunemediated colitis depends on the type of ICI and if used in combination.
Ipilimumab, as the ﬁrst FDA approved ICI in 2011, demonstrate a
survival beneﬁt in patients with metastatic melanoma. Gastrointestinal
immune-related adverse events are commonly associated with antiCTLA-4 therapy, and colitis tends to be the ﬁrst immune-related adverse
event leading to discontinuation of anti-CTLA-4[31,32]. As previously
reported, the incidence of colonic perforation of ipilimumab in studies
ranged from 1.0% to 1.5% among patients with melanoma to 6.6%
among patients with renal cell carcinoma [11,33]. 25%-30% of patients
receiving anti-CTLA-4 agents developed colitis, which shared some similarities with inﬂammatory bowel diseases [10,11,34]. Anti-PD-1 and
anti-PD-L1 agents are associated with a lower rate of colitis 1.3%-2.9%
and 0.7%-19.7%, respectively [12].
Recent studies have shown a potential association between diﬀerences in gut microbiota and diﬀerences in both survival rate and incidence of ICI-induced colitis [35]. It was suggested that ipilimumab
monotherapy resulted in a higher risk of developing colitis events
compared to therapy with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors in our study, consistent with several systematic reviews [36,37]. No signiﬁcant diﬀerence was observed in immune-related colitis between diﬀerent tumor
types with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors [37]. Due to the toxicity proﬁle of
anti-CTLA-4, anti-PD-1 adjuvant therapy, or dabrafenib/trametinib are
the preferred treatment options. Ipilimumab has not been approved in
the adjuvant setting by European Medicines Agency [38]. However,
more attention should be paid to anti-PD-1 agents with an increasing
number of cases of colitis induced by pembrolizumab and nivolumab.
As the administration of a combination of anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD1/PD-L1 agents manifested further clinical beneﬁts, dual ICIs treatment
in a concurrent regimen was applied for the treatment of many cancers.
ICI combination therapy resulted in increased frequency and severity of
colitis than with the use of either agent alone, and cause rarer forms of
toxicities like pancreatitis and small bowel enteritis which warrants
discontinuation of ICI treatment and initiation of immunosuppressive
therapy [39–41]. Combination therapy raised the risk of gastrointestinal toxicities to about 45%, which is higher than monotherapy

Table 2. Statistically, we found that ICIs induced other immune-related
adverse events co-occurrence with colitis targeted many organ systems,
mainly involved 11.99% dermatologic and mucosal toxicity (rash, oral
mucositis, etc.), 11.78% endocrinopathies (hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, hypophysitis, adrenal insuﬃciency, etc.), 8.14% hepatotoxicity (hepatitis, etc.), 6.60% kidney (nephritis, acute kidney injury,
etc.), 6.42% hematologic (red cell aplasia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, etc.), 6.39% pneumonitis, 5.76% rheumatololgic (arthritis, sicca
syndrome, etc.), 2.59% neurologic (encephalitis, myasthenia gravis,
etc.), 2.51% pancreatitis, and 1.00% eye (conjunctivitis, uveitis, etc.).
The highest number of colitis reports was for ipilimumab monotherapy (n = 1,177), followed by ipilimumab plus nivolumab combination therapy (n = 972). The mean age of patients was 60.65 to
72 years. Only the report of pembrolizumab monotherapy or nivolumab
monotherapy has one or two patients younger than 18 years, respectively. The patients aﬀected were more often males than females
(53.51% vs 33.18%), with 13.31% of the events gender not recorded.
Most of the cases were from North America (49.89%), followed by
Europe (26.78%) and Asia (19.68%), mainly submitted by physician
and health-care professionals. Colitis adverse events were commonly
reported in patients with melanoma and lung cancer. A total of 3,694
cases and 6,255 adverse outcomes of colitis concerning ICI was reported, mainly including outcomes of hospitalization-initiated or prolonged and other serious (important medical event). Among all cases,
17.43% cases of colitis concerning ICIs lead to death. More than 20%
cases of colitis concerning ICIs monotherapy lead to death included
avelumab, cemiplimab, pembrolizumab, and nivolumab. However,
ratio of colitis cases of death in ipilimumab plus nivolumab combination therapy or ipilimumab plus pembrolizumab combination therapy
were 14.57% and 12.24%, respectively.
3.3. Time to onset of ICI-associated colitis
It can be seen from the data that the adverse event of colitis occurred earliest in ipilimumab monotherapy with a median time to onset
of 64.21 days (IQR: 27–69 days) among all monotherapies (Table 3).
The median time to onset of cemiplimab monotherapy was 191.25 days
(IQR: 136.5–347 days). Ipilimumab plus pembrolizumab combination
therapy with a median time to onset of 46.92 days (IQR: 19–60.5) was
earlier than ipilimumab or pembrolizumab monotherapy. 52.17% and
45.79% of the adverse events of colitis occurred within 30 days for
durvalumab and pembrolizumab, respectively.
4. Discussion
To the best of our knowledge, it is the most extensive collection of
the colitis following the use of various ICI regimens to date based on the

[41]. In this study, the speciﬁc mechanism of ipilimumab combined
with nivolumab induced less colitis was still unclear and needed to be
further explored. Thus, the need for a more detailed description of
colitis-associated with combined anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1 agents is
urged.
According to epidemiological results, melanoma incidence peaks at
65 years though any age can be aﬀected [38,42]. Based on the current
study, 51.68% of ICI-related colitis was mainly detected in elderly patients over 65 years old excluding unknown data, which corroborated
the consensus on immunotherapy from the 2017 Chinese Lung Cancer
Summit expert panel, indicating that more attention should be paid to
side eﬀects caused by ICIs especially among elderly patients [43]. A
retrospective review at MD Anderson have shown that Caucasian ethnicity, melanoma, stage 3 cancer, received ICI regimens containing
ipilimumab, and shorter duration of ICI treatment were predictors of
colitis that requires immunosuppression [44].
The ranges of time to onset after ICI therapy are quite broad but
generally occurs within weeks to a couple of months after the initiation
of therapy, though infrequently can occur even up to a year after the
therapy has been discontinued [14]. Immune-mediated colitis and
diarrhea typically occur 5–10 weeks after the second or third dose, but
they have also been documented to occur as late as 4 months after the
last dose and may even recur one to two years after discontinuation of
treatment [13,45,46]. The median time of colitis onset following the
last dose of ipilimumab was 11 days, ranged from 0 to 59 days [11,33].
The median time of anti-PD-1 agents from initiation to symptom onset
was 3 months [31]. Ipilimumab with a median time to onset of
64.21 days (IQR: 27–69 days) was observed. However, data on the
number of doses used were not available in our study. We evaluated the
onset time of colitis after every single dose of ICIs treatment. It can be
seen from the data that the adverse event of colitis occurred earlier in
ipilimumab compared with other monotherapies, followed by durvalumab. However, few colitis reports of durvalumab and avelumab were
included. Further data was needed to be collected. Moreover, diarrhea
and colitis, including severe forms, associated with combination
therapy, typically occurred earlier in the treatment course compared to
monotherapy with either ipilimumab or anti-PD-1[14]. From FAERS
database, earlier onset of colitis under a combination of ipilimumab
plus pembrolizumab and ipilimumab plus nivolumab were observed
compared with pembrolizumab and nivolumab alone respectively, in
consistence with previous reports. However, compared with ipilimumab, a combination of ipilimumab plus pembrolizumab appeared to
have later onset of colitis, which may be associated with reported fewer
cases of combined application.
It was observed that colitis generally portended poor outcomes,
mainly resulting in hospitalization-initiated or prolonged or other serious (important medical event). Analysis of the World Health
Organization pharmacovigilance database (Vigilyze) and seven international academic centers in a retrospective cohort found that colitis
(including colitis with bowel perforation) was the most frequent cause
of adverse event-related deaths for patients treated with anti-CTLA-4
monotherapy. However, adverse event-related deaths for anti-PD-1/PDL1 agents were most often from pneumonitis, hepatitis, and neurotoxic
eﬀects [27]. A 0.6% mortality rate from complications of ipilimumabinduced enterocolitis has been reported [47]. With respect to monotherapy, avelumab presented the highest risk of death. Nevertheless, it
is diﬃcult to accurately determine the risk of death due to the number
of reports, and continued surveillance is needed. The results of previously published case series reported more frequent death due to colitis-associated with two ICI regimens. Adverse events-related deaths in
patients treated with combination CTLA-4/PD-1 inhibitors were most
frequently from colitis [27]. Notably, the combination therapies did not
increase fatality comparing with individual monotherapies.
Our data indicated that non-negligible reporting among these safety
issues. Clinicians should be aware that these toxicities do occur and
may even be fatal especially colitis. The initial assessment is crucial

when starting ICI treatment since early management might prevent
developing progression to more severe toxicity. As the application of
immune therapies continues to rise in oncology, the assessment and
characterization of ICI-associated colitis are quite necessary.
Spontaneous reporting systems can serve as a primary source of postmarketing data and play an essential role in the detection of safety issues. It is important to recognize the associations of speciﬁc ICI regimens with the risk of colitis as well as the features and to develop an
awareness of the possibility of this adverse event among oncologists,
gastroenterologists, emergency department physicians, pharmacists,
and other specialists. The present ﬁndings need to be considered in
clinical decisions on ICI treatment and in further clinical trials regarding various ICI regimens.
Although the data mining techniques used in this study have many
advantages, unavoidably, there are certain limitations in this study.
First, the main limitations of data mining techniques are inevitable and
unquantiﬁable underreporting and the potential for the data to be
misunderstood, caused by FAERS database in itself. Second, removed
data from the deleted ﬁle followed a deduplication procedure according
to the FDA’s recommendations exists a question that the reports may be
with diﬀerent CASEID but overlapping data. Only a limited number of
reports were identiﬁed as a duplicate. However, when we tried to remove overlaps in three or four out of four ﬁelds (event_dt, age, sex,
reporter_country) as mentioned in the literature [48], a large part of
reports would be lost. We further found that the cause of this result was
missing in the event date, age, and sex ﬁelds, and the fact that only the
year was presented in the event data ﬁeld of a considerable number of
records, leading to excessive deduplicates. So the method of deduplication deserves attention and further to discuss. Third, it is diﬃcult to
control for confounding factors such as pre-existing gastrointestinal
diseases, comorbidities, or other factors that might have an impact on
the risk of colitis. Although data mining techniques can provide a
proﬁle of ICI-associated colitis through signal detection, it is generally
insuﬃcient to prove a causal relationship in itself, while the calculation
of the incidence of ICI-associated colitis is not guaranteed. Fourth,
pharmacovigilance (analysis of spontaneous reporting systems) does
not allow to provide safety comparison among drugs, assess the associations, provide risk rankings or calculate incidence beyond basic
hypothesis generation because measures of disproportionality are
missing the incidence denominators, are subject to severe reporting
bias, and are not adjusted for confounding [49,50]. Hypotheses generated by disproportionality analyses must be investigated by more
robust methods before they can be allowed to inﬂuence clinical decisions. Despite the limitation of pharmacovigilance studies using the
FAERS database above, identifying signals of ICI regimens and colitis,
and further characterize the proﬁle of treatments with ICI regimens.
Our investigation can achieve clues for further well-organized clinical
studies with respect to ICI-associated colitis.

5. Conclusion
ICI may lead to severe and disabling ICIs-associated colitis during
monotherapies or combination therapies. We identiﬁed and characterized signiﬁcant colitis-associated with ICIs based on the FAERS database. The most apparent ﬁnding to emerge from this study is that ipilimumab was noteworthy for its relatively highest reporting of colitis
than other ICI monotherapies, while combined ICI regimens presented
higher reporting of colitis than monotherapies. Further pharmacoepidemiological studies are required to test the hypotheses generated by
this study. Our investigation/study provides a foundation for further
surveillance and investigation into this matter.
