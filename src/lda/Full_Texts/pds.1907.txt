SUMMARY
Purpose To assess the nature, severity, predictability and preventability of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) and to identify risk factors for
antiretroviral ADRs.
Methods Enrolled ambulatory patients were intensively monitored for ADRs. Spontaneously reported ADRs by clinicians were also
included. Predictability was assessed based on history of previous exposure to the drug or literature incidence of ADRs. Preventability was
assessed using Schumock and Thornton criteria and severity was assessed using modified Hartwig and Siegel scale. Bivariate analysis and
subsequently multivariate logistic regression were used to identify the risk factors for ADRs. Data from spontaneous reporting was assessed
using Bayesian neural network method for possible ADR signals.
Results Monitoring by active surveillance indentified 159 (52.82%) ADRs from 400 patients. One hundred and forty-two (47.17%)
reactions were spontaneously reported. Anaemia and vomiting were the most commonly observed ADRs. The ADRs were severe in 10.9% of
cases. A total of 88% ADRs were definitely/probably preventable. Use of ZidovudineþLamivudine with Nevirapine or Efavirenz, CD4
<200 cells/ml, female gender, tuberculosis and illiteracy were observed as risk factors for ADRs by bivariate analysis. Concurrent
tuberculosis was the only influential risk factor for development of ADRs identified by multivariate logistic regression.
Conclusion Prevalence of ADRs in intensively monitored patients was found to be 39.7%. Tuberculosis in HIV patients is an influential risk
factor for occurrence of ADRs. With the increasing access to antiretrovirals in India, ADRs to antiretrovirals require monitoring and reporting.

INTRODUCTION
An estimated 33 million people are living with human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and around 3
million people have access to antiretroviral therapy
(ART) worldwide.1,2 Antiretrovirals have brought a ray

of hope to people living with HIV. Unfortunately,
adverse effects of these drugs are of serious concern.
Adverse reactions to antiretrovirals in HIV patients
cause medication non-adherence leading to treatment
failure.3
The Indian government has continued efforts to
expand access to antiretrovirals. Phase-III of the Indian
national AIDS control programme is estimated to
spend INR 13 340 millions (US $266 million) for ART
by 2011.4 National AIDS Control Organization
(NACO) has established ART centres which offer free

treatment for HIV and related opportunistic infections
(OIs).5 It is estimated that across India, free ART will
be provided to 300 000 adults and 40 000 children by
2012.5
The Indian National Pharmacovigilance Programme
lacks continuity. There is a lack of awareness and
inadequate training about drug safety monitoring
among healthcare professionals in India. Often adverse
drug reactions (ADRs) go unnoticed or are not
reported. Monitoring and reporting of ADRs to ART
in the Indian population is very important. To our
knowledge, there are no systematic studies conducted
in India concerning ADRs in HIV patients receiving
ART. This study was conducted to assess the nature,
severity, predictability and preventability of ADRs to
ART, and to identify risk factors for ADRs in HIV
positive patients receiving ART.
METHODS
The study was conducted at the ART Centre, Krishna
Rajendra (KR) Hospital, Mysore, India. The study was
approved by the Institutional Human Ethical Committee of JSS College of Pharmacy, Mysore. Both active
(intensive monitoring) and passive surveillance (spontaneous reporting) pharmacovigilance methodologies
were adopted. HIV positive patients receiving fixed
dose drug combinations of ART were included. The
patients were divided into two groups. The first
consisted of newly registered HIV positive patients
being started on ART. Written informed consent was
obtained from these patients. Between June 2008 and
February 2009, these patients were intensively
monitored by a graduate trainee clinical pharmacist
for any ADRs during follow-up visits to the ART
centre: {(an initial visit after a 2 week period, followed
by monthly visits) (The Intensive Monitoring Group—
IM)}. ADRs were identified by an interview with the
patient and/or their attendants, as well as a review of
out-patient case records, laboratory reports, clinician’s
notes and prescriptions at each follow-up visit.
Suspected ADRs documented with necessary information were reviewed and assessed by a senior
academic clinical pharmacist. Wherever appropriate,
suspected ADRs were discussed with the clinicians.
The second group of patients included those who had
previously been diagnosed as HIV positive and were
started on ART between August 2004 and May 2008.
ADR notification forms were made available to
healthcare professionals to spontaneously report ADRs
in the second group of patients: (The Spontaneous
Report group—SR) between June 2008 and February
2009.

The World Health Organization (WHO) ADR
probability scale and Naranjo’s algorithm were used
for causality assessment.6,7 Severity of ADRs were
assessed using the Modified Hartwig and Siegel scale.8
If the drug had previously been well tolerated by the
patient at the same dose and route of administration,
the ADR was considered as ‘not predictable’. If there
was a history of allergy or reactions to the drug during
previous exposure, the ADR was considered ‘predictable’. In patients who had never received the drug
previously, any ADR with a literature incidence of 1/
100 was considered ‘predictable’. Modified Shumock
and Thornton criteria were used to assess the
preventability of ADRs.9 Reactions were coded using
WHO-Adverse Reaction Terminologies (WHOART).10
Using bivariate analysis, predictors associated
with the ADRs to ART at a p-value <0.05 were
identified (independent variables) in IM patients.
Multivariate logistic regression was used to evaluate
the influence of these independent variables on ADRs
to ART. Data from spontaneous reporting were
assessed using a Bayesian neural network method
to identify potential signals. This method uses log2 of
the proportional reporting ratio (ratio of number of
observations of a particular drug—reaction combination and number expected) and calls this as
information component (IC). It also calculates a
95% confidence interval (CI) around the IC so that an
ADR signal is detected if the lower limit of the CI is
above zero.11 All statistical calculations were performed using Statistical Package for Social Science
(SPSS) Version 17.0. A p-value of <0.05 was
considered as statistically significant.
RESULTS
During the study period, 400 patients were included in
the IM group and 1318 patients were in the SR group.
The majority of patients were adults (92.8%), but
children aged 15 years (6.6%) and patients aged
60 years and above (0.6%) were also included
(Table 1). There was a preponderance of male patients
(61%). The baseline CD4 count in the majority
of patients (71.7%) was 200 cells/ml. Zidovudineþlamivudineþnevirapine (43.9%) and stavudineþlamivudineþnevirapine (31.8%) combinations
were widely used.
During the study, 301 ADRs to antiretrovirals were
observed in 245 patients from both groups with an
overall prevalence of 17.5%. The prevalence of ADRs
in IM patients was 39.7 and 10.8% in SR patients
(Table 2). Prevalence of ADRs was higher in female

population [21% (141/670)] compared to males [15.3%
(160/1048)]. Almost all ADRs were observed in adults
[99.6% (300/301); 159 in IM group and 141 in SR
group]. Only one [0.3% (1/301)] reaction (nevirapine
induced hepatitis) was observed in a pediatric patient.
The organ system affected in the majority of ADRs
was gastro-intestinal (GI): (60) followed by red blood
cells; (53), skin and appendages; (48) and metabolic
and nutritional system (48). Psychiatric disorders (2)
were the least observed (Table 2). The commonly
observed ADRs were anaemia (53) followed by
vomiting (53) and hyperlactatemia (33). The ADRs
like hyperlactatemia, peripheral neuropathy and
lipodystrophy syndrome were reported mainly through
spontaneous reporting (Table 2).
Higher prevalence of ADRs was noted with
zidovudineþlamivudineþnevirapine
combination
(20.9%) while the prevalence was lowest with
zidovudineþlamivudineþefavirenz (14.4%). In the
IM patients, the incidence rate of ADRs was highest
with zidovudineþlamivudineþnevirapine combination (3.3 per 1000 patient-days) and lowest with

the zidovudineþlamivudineþefavirenz combination
(0.2 per 1000 patient-days) (Table 2). The incidence
rates of ADRs in SR patients could not be computed
due to non-availability of complete information on
exposure to ART.
In the majority of ADRs, causality was ‘probable’
(59.1%) and ‘possible’ (38.9%) by WHO probability
scale. Using Naranjo’s algorithm, causality was
‘possible’ and ‘probable’ in 68.1 and 30.2% cases,
respectively (Table 3). Among 301 ADRs, 139 ADRs
each were ‘moderate’ and ‘mild’ in severity. Most of
the mild ADRs {64.7% (90/139)} were noted in IM
group (Figure 1). Almost all the ADRs that were
‘moderate’ in severity [92.2% (131/139)] required
discontinuation of suspected drug(s). ADRs that
required hospitalization or increased the hospital
stay [20.6% (62/301)] included anaemia, hyperlactatemia, Stevens Johnson syndrome and hepatitis.
Reactions were ‘severe’ in 23 (7.6%) cases with one
fatal reaction (immune reconstitution syndrome paradoxical type following the initiation of zidovudineþlamivudineþefavirenz treatment).

Figure 1. Severity of adverse drug reactions

The suspected drug was withdrawn in 43.5% (131/
301) of ADRs and no change was incorporated in the
remainder. Symptomatic treatment was given in 52.8%
of ADR cases (Figure 2). The majority of the patients
recovered from the ADR [80.1% (241/301)], while a
small but notable number [19.6% (59/301)] continued

to suffer even at their last follow-up visit. Of the 301
ADRs, 280 (93%) were ‘predictable’ (160 in IM group
and 120 in SR group) and 21 (7%) were ‘nonpredictable’ (13 in IM group and 8 in SR group). The
majority of ADRs (82.7%) were ‘probably preventable’ and 5.3% ADRs were ‘definitely preventable’.
Only 12% ADRs were ‘non-preventable’ (Table 4).
Bivariate analysis identified CD4 count <200 cells/
ml, female gender, concurrent tuberculosis, illiteracy
and use of zidovudineþlamivudine with nevirapine or
efavirenz as risk factors for ADRs (Table 5).
Concurrent tuberculosis was the only influential
risk factor for development of ADRs identified in a
logistic regression model {Odds ratio (OR): 3.78,
95%CI: 1.16–12.36, p ¼ 0.028} {R2 ¼ 0.03 (Hosmer
and Lemeshow), 0.04 (Cox and Snell), 0.05
(Nagelkerke), Model X2(1) ¼ 14.11, p ¼ 0.028}. Age,
concurrent herpes zoster and use of stavudineþ
lamivudineþefavirenz were not significantly associated with the development of ADRs. Zidovudine use
was observed as a risk factor for ADRs like anaemia,
vomiting, myalgia and nail discoloration. Stavudine
use was identified as a risk factor for peripheral
neuropathy while nevirapine use and female gender
were the risk factors for skin reactions (Table 6).
Zidovudine induced anaemia [Information Component (IC): 1.56, CI: 0.7–2.42], zidovudine induced
vomiting [IC: 1.12, CI: 0.23–2.01], stavudine induced
symptomatic hyperlactataemia [IC: 1.31, CI: 0.46–
2.16], stavudine induced peripheral neuropathy [IC:
1.20, CI: 0.34–2.05], stavudine induced lipodystrophy
[IC: 0.66, CI: 0.03–1.28], efavirenz induced dizziness
[IC: 1.29, CI: 0.35–2.22] and nevirapine induced
hepatitis [IC: 1.03, CI: 0.17–1.89] were the ADRs
reported spontaneously with lower limit of CI around
the IC greater than zero (threshold for signal detection)

positive Indian patients. Both active and passive
surveillance methods were adopted. The study
observed significant morbidity associated with the
use of ART in the local population.
The difference in prevalence of ADRs between IM
and SR groups is to be expected because IM identified
more mild ADRs which might have gone unreported in
SR group. Gender-wise prevalence of ADRs observed
in IM group was similar to that observed in other
studies.12–15 Also, IM female patients were at greater
risk (OR: 1.75) ( p ¼ 0.004) for development of ADRs.
Majority of ADRs observed in adults, similar to
another study16 is likely to be due to large numbers of
adults treated at the ART centre during the study
period. However, a previous study has reported larger
percentage of ADRs in geriatric and pediatric
populations.17
The majority of the ADRs were predictable as they
were common (incidence 1/100 and <1/10) or very
common (incidence 1/10).18 Findings of preventability were substantially higher than observed in a
study conducted by Mehta et al.16 (46.2%). In most of
preventable ADRs, preventive measures for ADRs
were not prescribed or administered to patients: for
example commonly no instructions were given to
patients to avoid fatty foods and dairy products for

prevention of nausea and vomiting in patients receiving
zidovudine.
Vomiting was a common ADR observed among
patients who were on regimens containing zidovudine.
It was noted that a majority of these patients
experienced vomiting half an hour after ingestion of
the drug. Most of the GI ADRs were observed in the
first few weeks of therapy and symptoms were selflimiting. GI disorders are one cause for medication
non-adherence.3 Patients receiving a zidovudinecontaining regimen had a greater risk (OR: 11.14)
( p < 0.001) of vomiting similar to that observed in an
Iranian study.19
Anaemia occurred in patients receiving zidovudine
containing regimen [Haemoglobin (Hb) <7 g/dl]
within the first few weeks to few months after initiation
of therapy in the IM group. In a few patients in SR
group, anaemia was seen after a year of a zidovudinecontaining regimen. In the majority of the cases, severe
anaemia (Hb <4 g/dl) was observed requiring blood
transfusion. In almost all cases (52/53), an improvement in Hb level was observed on discontinuation of
zidovudine similar to the findings reported by Koduri

and Parekh.20 Results from the TAHOD study found
that anaemia (Hb <10 g/dl) with zidovudine therapy
was associated with low baseline Hb level, older age
and female gender.21 In our study, patients were
initiated on a zidovudine-containing regimen only if
Hb level was more than 8 g/dl at baseline, thereby
avoiding the occurrence of anaemia. Older age and
female gender were not significantly associated with
anaemia. However, we observed a highly significant
association (OR: 16.2) ( p < 0.001) between the use of
zidovudine and anaemia which is similar to other
studies.22,23
All skin reactions occurred in patients receiving a
nevirapine-containing regimen. In the majority of
patients, a definite improvement of skin reaction was
observed after nevirapine was discontinued. Nevirapine use (OR: 10.68) ( p ¼ 0.022) and female gender
(OR: 2.94) ( p ¼ 0.04) were identified as risk factors for
the development of skin reactions in the IM group
similar to findings of a study conducted by Lazzari
et al.24 Stevens Johnson Syndrome (SJS) was observed
in the first week of nevirapine therapy similar to that
observed in a case control study wherein two thirds of
patients developed SJS or toxic epidermal necrolysis in
the first week of nevirapine treatment.25
Nail discoloration was observed only in patients
receiving zidovudine therapy. Discoloration of both
finger and toe nails was observed similar to the findings
by Rahav and Maayan.26 Symptomatic hyperlactataemia
was observed after more than 6 months to a year of
therapy with stavudine. A direct role of stavudine in
pathogenesis of symptomatic hyperlactataemia is probable as it occurred only in patients who were on a
stavudine-containing combination and stavudine dechallenge was positive in all these patients. Our findings are
similar to observations in a recently published study,
where stavudine was found to be a major risk factor for
the development of chronic hyperlactatemia.27 No deaths
occurred due to symptomatic hyperlactataemia in our
study, further confirming the fact that life threatening
hyperlactatemia is a rare feature.28 Corroborating the
literature reports,29–33 most of the lipodystrophy cases
were observed in patients receiving stavudine therapy.
All lipodystrophy cases were reported in SR patients as
this is a long-term ADR.31
Peripheral neuropathy was observed in patients who
were on stavudine for more than 6 months. In 46.7%
(14/30) of these cases, stavudine was discontinued and
the patient recovered. Six patients who experienced
peripheral neuropathy were receiving concomitant anti
tuberculosis (TB) drugs and pyridoxine with a
stavudine-containing regimen. In four of these six
cases, positive dechallenge to stavudine was observed

suggesting a likely association of stavudine. The
incidence of peripheral neuropathy observed in IM
patients receiving a stavudine-containing regimen was
much less compared to the rate observed by von Giesen
et al.34 (10%). This difference could be due to a
relatively shorter duration of intensive monitoring in
our study.35 However, stavudine is a risk factor for
peripheral neuropathy which was also suggestive from
our results (OR: 11.9) ( p ¼ 0.011).36
The occurrence of dizziness was highly associated
with efavirenz therapy (OR: 18.07) ( p < 0.001).
Similar to the observations in the study by Fumaz
et al.,37 there was a significant association (OR: 6.20)
( p ¼ 0.015) between efavirenz and the onset of
dizziness within the first 2 weeks of efavirenz therapy.
The occurrence of this ADR was minimized by
administering the efavirenz once a day at night.
The IRIS was observed within the first 6 months of
ART. In majority of the patients [94.4% (17/18)], IRIS
manifested as TB. Our study findings are similar to a
South African study wherein majority of IRIS cases
(41%) manifested as TB.38 Liver injury is commonly
associated with nevirapine therapy.39–42 Liver enzyme
levels were raised by up to five times the upper limit of
normal in all nine cases, suggesting that injury was
hepatocellular in nature.43 All patients recovered from
liver injury following nevirapine dechallenge.
Peripheral edema developed after 2 weeks to a year
of starting therapy with stavudine-containing regimen.
This ADR was specific to patients receiving stavudine
and patients recovered from edema following discontinuation of stavudine as observed in a previously
published case series.44 The patients did not complain
of edema after switch over from stavudine to
zidovudine.
HIV patients being treated for OIs experience ADRs
at a much higher rate.45 Antibiotics and drugs used for
treatment of OIs are implicated in two thirds of
hospital-acquired ADRs.18 We observed that the
probability of occurrence of ADRs to antiretrovirals
in patients with HIV and TB was 7.4 times higher
compared to HIV patients without any OIs ( p ¼ 0.003).
Illiteracy was identified as a risk factor for ADRs to
antiretrovirals (OR: 1.82) ( p ¼ 0.003). However, we
could not directly correlate the illiteracy status and the
cause of increased ADRs in this population.
The quantitative criterion (threshold) for signal
detection using the Bayesian neural network method
was met by following drug/ADR pairs: zidovudine
induced anaemia and vomiting; stavudine induced
symptomatic hyperlactataemia, peripheral neuropathy
and lipodystrophy; efavirenz induced dizziness and
nevirapine induced hepatitis. Except for zidovudine

KEY POINTS
 More than one third of the HIV positive patients

experience an adverse drug reaction (ADR) to
antiretrovirals in ambulatory settings.
 Patients receiving zidovudineþlamivudine with
efavirenz/nevirapine are at greater risk for the
development of ADRs.
 Occurrence of peripheral neuropathy even with
concomitant pyridoxine is possible in patients
receiving stavudine with anti-tubercular therapy.
 As we improve the access to ART, monitoring of
patients for ADRs is vital.

induced vomiting all other drug/ADR pairs were with
lower limit of IC above the threshold for signal
detection in the VigimineTM in the third quarter of
2009.46 However, these reactions did not meet all the
qualitative criteria for an ADR signal.47
CONCLUSION
ART with zidovudineþlamivudineþnevirapine/efavirenz is a predictor of ADRs. HIV patients who are
illiterate, of female gender, with CD4 <200 cells/ml, or
with tuberculosis need intensive monitoring for ADRs.
Attention needs to be drawn to the monitoring of ADRs
to antiretrovirals whilst simultaneously improving
access to ART for the Indian population.
