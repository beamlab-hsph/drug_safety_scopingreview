Abstract Objective The proportional reporting ratio
(PRR) is a statistical method for signal detection of adverse
drug reactions (ADRs) based on unbalanced proportions.
Although effective, this method only takes into account the
proportional relation based on target adverse reactions and
ignores the relation between a given ADR and the others
for the same drug. Therefore, it is necessary to improve the
calculation deviation in PRR. In this study, we developed a
novel PRR (NPRR) method and compared it with the original PRR method for the purpose of a combined application of these two methods for ADR signal detection.
Methods NPRR is also based on unbalanced proportions, in
which the proportion for a given ADR is linked to a specific drug (or all other drugs), and then divided by the
corresponding proportion for all other ADRs. Results
Applying this method to the ADR data of Jiangsu Province,
China in 2008 and 2009, we detected 3,021 signals.
Compared with the PRR method, the sensitivity of our
method is 0.99, the specificity is 0.97, and the Youden
index is 0.96. Conclusion NPRR is an excellent method
supplementary to PRR. The combination of these two
methods can reduce calculation deviation and detect ADRs
more effectively.

Introduction
According to the adverse reaction terminology of the World
Health Organization, adverse drug reactions are defined as
follows: ‘‘A response to a drug which is noxious and
unintended, and which occurs at doses normally used in
man for the prophylaxis, diagnosis, or therapy of disease, or
for the modification of physiologic function’’ [1]. The
research limitations on drugs before their availability in the
market inevitably result in some adverse drug reactions. In
order to reduce the damage of ADRs, many countries have
established their own ADR Monitoring Centers through
which a large amount of ADR data is collected. Moreover,
various methods have been developed to detect the causal
relationships between drugs under detection and adverse
reactions from vast amounts of data and to identify the
potential danger signals in better ways. So far, disproportionality measurements are the only data-mining technology
for ADR verification. Statistical analyses based on this
theory are known to be useful in signal detection in spontaneous reporting systems, such as PRR [2], ROR [3] and
BCPNN [4]. Long before 1974, Finney [5] illustrated the

Pharm World Sci (2010) 32:658–662

659

theoretical basis for measures of disproportionality. Subsequently, Napke [6] artificially determined the disproportionality in the table form in a way of pigeonhole sort. In
1992, when Stricker [7] put it into the practice of drug
safety, Cefaclor was introduced to report the reaction of
blood serum samples. Subsequently, various methods based
on this theory have been proposed and applied to ADR
signal detection, achieving relatively good results [8–10].
Currently, major countries and institutions use different
detection methods [11, 12], and there is no ‘gold’ standard
available for ADR signal detection worldwide. Every
method has its merits and limitations. Here we introduced a
novel PRR method based on the modified original method
in order to improve the PPR method for signal detection.

The formula (2) indicates the proportion between target
ADR caused by target drug and that caused by all drugs is
relatively high, which is much higher than that between
non-target ADR caused by target drug and that caused by
all drugs, indicating the disproportionality. Alphabets a and
b in formula (2) refer to the numbers of the target drug, so
NPRR is a new disproportion based on target drug.

The formula (1) shows the proportion between target

and it is far higher than that between target ADR and all
ADRs caused by other drugs, indicating the disproportionality. Alphabets a and c refer to the numbers of target ADR,
i.e., the PRR value is disproportional based on target ADR.

We performed an analysis of data collected by Jiangsu
Center for ADR Monitoring, P. R. China in 2008 and 2009,
which included 6,853 combinations of drug and ADRs with
an occurring frequency of no less than 3. Data items contain drug name, ADR name and occurring frequency. In the
event of b = 0 or c = 0, the two methods cannot be
applied, so the records coming up to 27 were deleted.

Detection results
In our experiment, the PRR method detected 3,117 suspected signals, while NPRR detected 3,021 suspected signals. Table 2 shows the top ten combinations of drug-ADR
identified by both methods. (Insert Table 2 here.)
Meanwhile, these two methods have similar normal
distributions, as shown in Fig. 1.

when a is greater or equal to 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8. Table 6
shows the results of sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV
of the two methods. (Insert Table 6 here.)
We find that all the indicators of both methods are very
good. In particular, the sensitivity of NPRR, specificity of
PRR, PPV of PRR and NPV of NPRR are close to 1. With
the increase of a, the number of test samples gradually
decreases and all the indicators become larger. In this case,
the two methods have nearly the same Youden Index, but
compared with NPRR, the sensitivity of PRR is always
lower and the specificity is higher. This observation can
explain why the number of signals detected by NPRR is
low than that by PRR.

Result differences

Calculation deviation

As shown in Table 3, the number of the same results is
3,018; three signals were detected by NPRR but not PRR;
and 99 signals were detected by PRR but not NPRR. For
the three signals, b is low, so they can be detected by
NPRR more easily. For the 99 signals, c is low in a great
measure so they can be detected by PRR more easily.
Table 5 shows that there are 14 recognized adverse
reactions among 102 signals. The precision of PRR is
92.86%, while NPRR is only 7.14%. (Insert Table 5 here.)

Although NPRR and PRR have a considerably high correlation coefficient, there is some difference in their results. To
further describe the difference between PRR and NPRR, we
used Matlab software to draw variation charts of results from
these two methods under the assumption: a = 100 and b,
c range from 1 to 500.
With the reduction of c, PRR value tends to increase
quickly, while with the reduction of b, the increasing speed
of PRR value becomes slower. Therefore, c has a stronger
impact on PRR results than b, i.e., PRR relies on c to a
greater extent. NPRR has an opposite trend: it extremely
relies on b. From the viewpoint of random events, b and
c are independent from each other, so there must be
calculation deviations exist in PRR and NPRR.

Sensitivity to a
In order to test the sensitivity to a, the number of a certain
ADR reported in our database, we performed the analyses

Discussion
According to Evans et al. [2], the PRR method aims to detect
signals through the proportional relationship between target
ADR and other ADRs caused by target drug and other drugs.
This method has been successfully applied to Yellow Card
Database of UK Medicines Control Agency. Later, Rothman
et al. [3] introduced another method, reporting odds ratio
(ROR) and suggested that PRR is not effective in evaluating
the relative risk (RR). To analyze spontaneous reports of
adverse events, PRR is similar to the proportionate mortality
ratio (PMR); and both PRR and PMR are limited because
simulated data demonstrate that they can infer the results
from numerator data only and cannot evaluate RR. Using the
data in Table 2 of Document 3, we calculated the RR values
of ROR, PRR and NPRR. Given that the actual RR is 0.1.,
ROR = (20/250)/(1,000/1,250) = 0.1, PRR = (20/270)/
(1,000/2,250) = 0.17, NPRR = (20/1,200)/(250/1,500) =
0.1. Therefore, we concluded that NPRR and ROR can calculate RR, but not PRR.
Although simulated data show that NPRR is effective in
evaluating RR, the most important thing is whether it can
effectively detect signals by large amounts of data. In the
present study, we used NPRR to detect the signals of the
real data and compared the results with those of PRR, and
we find no obvious differences between these PRR methods. In particular, their sensitivities and specificities are
similar, demonstrating the utility of the NPRR method in
ADR signal detection.
To detect ADR signals, b and c in the two-by-two
contingency table are assumed to be independent and
irrelevant. Some deviations may exist in PRR and NPRR,

NPV

Youden Index

leading to some unreasonable results. In other words, PRR
and NPRR depend on the values of c or b to some extent. In
order to eliminate calculation deviation and make reasonable inferences, we combined these two methods to detect
signals using the standard of signal detection defined as
95% CI C 1 or 95% CI0  1.

Conclusion
According to the disproportionality theory, another
disproportionality based on target drug exists in the twoby-two contingency table in addition to the one based on
target ADR. Grounded on this new disproportionality idea,
we proposed another method of Proportional Reporting
Ratio. Experimental results show that this NPRR method is
effective for signal detection.
PRR and NPRR have a relatively high correlation
coefficient. However, NPRR depends on b as strong as
PRR depend on c. If there are some calculation deviations,
each method alone will lead to unreasonable results.
Therefore, to avoid the deviation, the combination of these
two methods would be the best choice for obtaining reasonable results.
