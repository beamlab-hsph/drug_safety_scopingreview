Abstract
Background: Clinical trials are often underpowered to detect serious but rare adverse
events of a new medication. We applied a novel data mining tool to detect potential
adverse events of canagliflozin, the first sodium glucose co-­transporter 2 (SGLT2 inhibitor) in the United States, using real-­world data from shortly after its market entry
and before public awareness of its potential safety concerns.
Methods: In a U. S. commercial claims dataset (29 March 2013–­30 Sept 2015), two pairwise cohorts of patients over 18 years of age with type 2 diabetes (T2D) who were newly
dispensed canagliflozin or an active comparator, that is a dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitor
(DPP4) or a glucagon-­like peptide 1 receptor agonist (GLP1), were identified and propensity
score-­matched. We used variable ratio matching with up to four people receiving a DPP4
or GLP1 for each person receiving canagliflozin. We identified potential safety signals using
a hierarchical tree-­based scan statistic data mining method with the hierarchical outcome
tree constructed based on international classification of disease coding. We screened for
incident adverse events where there were more outcomes observed among canagliflozin
vs. comparator initiators than expected by chance, after adjusting for multiple testing.
Results: We identified two pairwise propensity score variable ratio matched cohorts
of 44,733 canagliflozin vs. 99,458 DPP4 initiators, and 55,974 canagliflozin vs. 74,727
GLP1 initiators. When we screened inpatient and emergency room diagnoses, diabetic ketoacidosis was the only severe adverse event associated with canagliflozin
initiation with p < .05 in both cohorts. When outpatient diagnoses were also considered, signals for female and male genital infections emerged in both cohorts (p < .05).
Conclusions and relevance: In a large population-­based study, we identified known but
no other adverse events associated with canagliflozin, providing reassurance on its safety
among adult patients with T2D and suggesting the tree-­based scan statistic method is a
useful post-­marketing safety monitoring tool for newly approved medications.

comorbid conditions, this may partially account for why neither adverse event was detected by TreeScan.
The ability of TreeScan to identify recognized adverse events of
canagliflozin is relevant for other newly approved medications, especially now that approximately 60% of new medications approved
by the FDA undergo an expedited pathway based on shorter and
smaller clinical trials, some of which are non-­randomized, relative to
the non-­expedited approval pathway.6,30
The FDA identifies drug safety as its highest priority, and after
a drug is approved its safety is primarily monitored through spontaneous reports. Reports can be submitted by healthcare professionals, patients, drug manufacturers and lawyers.31,32 Since
spontaneous reports are voluntary, the quality is variable and under-­
reporting is common.33 In 2017, the FDA released ‘Sentinel Initiative:
Final Assessment Report’ which outlined how it would modernize
the process of post-­market drug safety surveillance, including the
