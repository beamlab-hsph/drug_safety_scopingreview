(FDA) licensed the quadrivalent human papillomavirus recombinant vaccine (qHPV) (Gardasil; Merck & Co, Inc, Whitehouse
Station, New Jersey) for females aged 9
to 26 years to prevent infection with
genital human papillomavirus (HPV)
types 6, 11, 16, and 18.1 Later that
month, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommended routine vaccination of females
aged 11 to 12 years with 3 doses of qHPV
and catch-up vaccination for females
aged 13 to 26 years. Doses are administered intramuscularly on a schedule of
0, 2, and 6 months.2 The viruses HPV-16
and HPV-18 can cause cervical cancer,
other anogenital cancers, and precancerous or dysplastic lesions and are responsible for about 70% of cervical cancers worldwide.3 The viruses HPV-6 and

Context In June 2006, the Food and Drug Administration licensed the quadrivalent
human papillomavirus (types 6, 11, 16, and 18) recombinant vaccine (qHPV) in the
United States for use in females aged 9 to 26 years; the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices then recommended qHPV for routine vaccination of girls aged
11 to 12 years.
Objective To summarize reports to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System
(VAERS) following receipt of qHPV.
Design, Setting, and Participants Review and describe adverse events following
immunization (AEFIs) reported to VAERS, a national, voluntary, passive surveillance
system, from June 1, 2006, through December 31, 2008. Additional analyses were
performed for some AEFIs in prelicensure trials, those of unusual severity, or those that
had received public attention. Statistical data mining, including proportional reporting
ratios (PRRs) and empirical Bayesian geometric mean methods, were used to detect
disproportionality in reporting.
Main Outcome Measures Numbers of reported AEFIs, reporting rates (reports per
100 000 doses of distributed vaccine or per person-years at risk), and comparisons with
expected background rates.
Results VAERS received 12 424 reports of AEFIs following qHPV distribution, a rate
of 53.9 reports per 100 000 doses distributed. A total of 772 reports (6.2% of all reports) described serious AEFIs, including 32 reports of death. The reporting rates per
100 000 qHPV doses distributed were 8.2 for syncope; 7.5 for local site reactions; 6.8
for dizziness; 5.0 for nausea; 4.1 for headache; 3.1 for hypersensitivity reactions; 2.6
for urticaria; 0.2 for venous thromboembolic events, autoimmune disorders, and GuillainBarré syndrome; 0.1 for anaphylaxis and death; 0.04 for transverse myelitis and pancreatitis; and 0.009 for motor neuron disease. Disproportional reporting of syncope
and venous thromboembolic events was noted with data mining methods.
Conclusions Most of the AEFI rates were not greater than the background rates
compared with other vaccines, but there was disproportional reporting of syncope and
venous thromboembolic events. The significance of these findings must be tempered
with the limitations (possible underreporting) of a passive reporting system.

HPV-11 are the most common causes of
genital warts.
Prior to licensure, clinical trials were
conducted in more than 21 000 women.
Vaccination with qHPV was 90% to
100% effective in preventing precancerous cervical, vaginal, and vulvar lesions and genital warts caused by infection with the relevant HPV types (6,
11, 16, or 18) in women aged 15 to 26

olds demonstrated high seropositivity
postvaccination; geometric mean antibody titers were as high as those of
women aged 16 to 23 years in the efficacy trials and, by postvaccination
month 7, were 1.7- to 2.7-fold higher.6
In the clinical trials, the incidence of
solicited systemic clinical adverse events
following immunization (AEFIs) was
similar in the vaccine group (59%) and
the placebo group (60%). Headache was
the most commonly reported systemic
AEFI in both groups (qHPV, 28.2%; placebo,28.4%).Proportionsoffever(13.0%
vs11.2%)andnausea(6.7%vs6.5%)were
slightly higher in the vaccine recipients
vs the placebo group. The rates of serious
AEFIs were comparable between the 2
groups (⬍0.1%). There was a slightly
higher number of severe injection site reactionsinthevaccinegroup(n=10,2.2%)
compared with the placebo group (n=4,
0.9%) in the 5 days after vaccination.1
Withmorethan23millionqHPVdoses
distributed in the United States as of
December 31, 2008 (number provided
by manufacturer, http://www.cdc.gov
/vaccinesafety/vaers/gardasil.htm), postlicensure safety monitoring can detect
AEFIs too rare to have been detected during prelicensure trials. This article summarizes data from the US Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS)
for the 2.5 years following licensure.
METHODS
We analyzed qHPV reports received by
VAERS from June 1, 2006, through December 31, 2008. This voluntary, national, passive surveillance system was
established in 1990 and is operated
jointly by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
Manufacturers, health care workers, patients or their parents, and others submit reports to VAERS.7 Although manufacturer reporting to VAERS is required,
most information comes from physicians, patients, or other primary reporters.8 This analysis included only US
reports to VAERS, which usually have
more complete information and more
feasible follow-up review of medical records than foreign reports. In addition,

we had only US dose distribution data
for calculation of reporting rates (RRs).
To code reported symptoms, VAERS
uses a clinically validated, internationally standardized terminology, the
Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA).9 Each report may
have several assigned MedDRA codes.
We searched the VAERS database using
MedDRA codes for specific AEFIs of interest and predefined groups of MedDRA codes for local reactions and hypersensitivity reactions.
We classified VAERS reports as serious according to the FDA regulatory definition(21CFR§314.80)ofaseriousAEFI
as one that is life threatening; results in
death, permanent disability, congenital
anomaly, hospitalization, or prolonged
hospitalization; or necessitates medical
or surgical intervention to preclude one
of these outcomes.10 We reviewed serious reports to identify primary AEs that
needed further study. Onset interval is
the number of days from the time of vaccination to the onset of earliest reported
symptoms. The number of doses distributed in the United States (23 051 336),
obtained from the vaccine manufacturer
(number provided by manufacturer,
http://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/vaers
/gardasil.htm), provided the denominator to estimate RRs.
Based on prelicensure safety data and
the severity of or public attention to reported AEFIs, we performed detailed
case reviews and separate analyses for
syncope, dizziness, nausea, headache, local injection site reactions, hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis,
Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS), transverse myelitis, pancreatitis, venous
thromboembolic events (VTEs), deaths,
and pregnancy outcomes.
Disproportionality screening with the
empirical Bayesian geometric mean
(EBGM) method, using Empirica
WebVDME software (Phase Forward,
Waltham, Massachusetts), identified
AEFIs reported during the first year of
licensure that were more frequent than
expected.11,12 We used the lower 5%
bound of the 90% confidence interval
for the EBGM (EB05) of 2 or higher,
following criteria outlined by Szarf-

man et al,13 to select AEFIs for further
review. We also used proportional reporting ratio (PRR), another method to
detect potential associations between reported AEFIs and a drug or vaccine, to
compare the proportion of selected
AEFI reports for qHPV with the proportion of selected AEFI reports for all
other vaccines by age group and sex.14,15
We applied the PRR screening criteria
that Evans15 proposed: number of cases
of 3 or more, PRR of 2 or more, and ␹2
of 4 or more.
Given the association of GBS with the
1976 swine influenza vaccine and more
recently with quadrivalent meningococcal conjugate vaccine,16 there has been
concern regarding the possibility of an
association between GBS and other vaccines, including qHPV.17,18 Clinical subject matter experts from the CDC Clinical Immunization Safety Assessment
Network reviewed reports coded with the
MedDRA term GBS or with text containing GBS or Guillain-Barré. Cases were
classified as confirmed GBS if they met
the proposed Brighton Collaboration
GBS case definition.19 Reports with insufficient information could not be classified. We used Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project data for 2000 through
2004 to estimate a background rate of
GBS among 9- to 26-year-old females.20
The GBS reporting rate to VAERS was
calculated as the number of reported GBS
cases divided by the estimated persontime at risk, based on 6 weeks after each
dose. This GBS reporting rate was compared with the background rate among
females aged 9 to 26 years. From June
1, 2006, through December 31, 2008,
there were 23 051 336 doses of qHPV distributed in the United States. Based on
a 6-week window of biological plausibility after immunization, this gives a
total of 2 650 667 person-years at risk.
Potential anaphylaxis reports were selected using the MedDRA terms anaphylaxis and anaphylactic reaction. Clinical
subject matter experts from the CDC
Clinical Immunization Safety Assessment Network reviewed reports to confirm the diagnosis of anaphylaxis. Reports were classified as anaphylaxis if
they met the Brighton case definition.21

Because VAERS is a legally mandated, government-sponsored surveillance system, institutional review board
approval and informed consent were
not required.
RESULTS
From June 1, 2006, through December 31, 2008, VAERS received 12 424
reports of AEFIs following receipt of
qHPV (TABLE 1), an overall reporting
rate of 53.9 reports per 100 000 vaccine doses distributed. The majority of
reports (8471/12 424, or 68%) were
submitted by the manufacturer, compared with an overall rate of 40% for
VAERS reports on other vaccines. During the same time period, manufacturer reports accounted for 14.5% of the
meningococcal conjugate vaccine reports and 7.5% of the reports for tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis vaccine
submitted to VAERS. Of the 8471
manufacturer reports for qHPV AEFIs,
7561 (89%) had insufficient identifying information to permit clinical follow-up or review. Additional sources
of reporting included providers (17%),
patients or parents (4%), state health
clinics (1%), and “others” (11%).
In 9910 of 12 424 reports (80%),
qHPV was the only vaccine identified.
Patients received qHPV and quadrivalent meningococcal conjugate vaccine
simultaneously in 775 of the AEFI reports (6%); the remaining 14% of reports described a variety of other vac752

cine combinations. Of the 8247 reports
that included onset interval, 4393
(40%) occurred on the day of vaccination. Females accounted for 97%
(12 039/12 424) of the patients for
whom an AEFI was reported; the remaining 3% included males and reports with unspecified gender. Of 47 reports of qHPV administered to males,
25 (53%) were unintentional (medical errors with wrong vaccine administered), 17 (36%) were identified as offlabel use, and 5 were from male HPV
study participants. Among 9396 reports (77%) with dose information,
5772 (61%) followed the first dose,
2380 (25%) followed the second dose,
and 1183 (13%) followed the third dose
of qHPV. In addition, 61 (1%) inadvertently received 4 or more doses.
The most frequently reported
AEFIs included syncope (n = 1847,
15%), dizziness (n=1763, 14%), nausea (n = 1170, 9%), headache (n=957,
8%), and injection site reactions
(n = 926, 7.5%). These overall aggregate numbers must be interpreted with
caution since each VAERS report usually includes multiple codes; thus, there
were 46 932 total codes for 12 424 reports, for an average of 3.7 codes per
report (range, 2-10). Also, review of individual reports revealed coding errors and occasional duplicate coding.
Serious Reports

Among the 12 424 AEFI reports, 772
(6.2%) were serious, including 32 re-

ports of death, 20 of which had medical records, autopsy, or death certificates available for evaluation. Sources
of serious VAERS reports included
manufacturer (66%), patient/parent
(11%), clinician (10%), state health
clinic (1%), and “other” (12%). The
most frequent serious symptom/
MedDRA preferred-term codes included 159 reports of headache (21%),
119 nausea (16%), 113 dizziness (15%),
102 vomiting (13%), 102 pyrexia
(13%), 102 fatigue (13%), and 98 syncope (13%). Medically important serious events included 8 reports of anaphylactic reaction (1%), 9 deep vein
thrombosis (1.2%), 31 GBS (4%), 25
hypersensitivity (2.5%), 10 transverse
myelitis (1.3%), 6 pancreatitis (0.8%),
14 pulmonary embolism (1.8%), 23
death (3%), 68 convulsion (8.8%), 30
urticaria (3.9%), and 9 autoimmune disorder (1.2%).
Local Injection Site Reactions

There were 1741 reports with at least
1 of the MedDRA coding terms for local reactions (TABLE 2); 684 (39%) occurred on the day of vaccination. The
median onset interval was 0 days after
vaccination (same day as vaccination)
with a range of 0 to 408 days; 1338 reports (77%) identified qHPV alone. The
most common local reaction reports included injection site pain (n = 926,
53%), injection site erythema (n=490,
28%), and injection site swelling
(n=385, 22%). Forty-one reports (2%)
involving local reactions were classified as serious. Review of these cases
showed that 20 reports did not meet the
FDA definition of serious; all of these
were reported by the manufacturer.
There were 4 cases reported as cellulitis and 1 case reported as an intraarticular injection. In the other 15 reports, local reactions were incidental
and not the primary AEFIs contributing to severity.
Syncope, Dizziness, and Nausea

There were 1896 reports with the coding term syncope or syncope vasovagal,
1572 with dizziness, and 1164 with nausea (Table 2). Only 62 reports de-

scribed all 3 events in the same individual. The qHPV was the only vaccine
given in 74% of the syncope/vasovagal
syncope reports, 73% of the dizziness
reports, and 78% of the nausea reports.
Of the reports describing syncope/
vasovagal syncope, dizziness, or nausea, 94%, 90%, and 95%, respectively,
were classified as nonserious. Among reports with known onset intervals, the
event occurred on the same day as vaccination for 90% (1107/1228) of syncopal reports, 75% (930/1233) of dizziness reports, and 63% (610/970) of
nausea reports. Of the events that occurred on the day of vaccination and
where a more specific time frame was
given, more than half immediately (ⱕ15
minutes) followed vaccination. Among
the 1896 syncopal reports, 293 (15%) resulted in a fall and 200 falls (68%) resulted in a head injury. Head injuries included 9 fractures (6 nose, 2 skull, and
1 maxillary), 18 dental injuries, 9 concussions, 17 contusions, 5 intracranial
hemorrhages (1 subdural hematoma, 1
subarachnoid hemorrhage, 3 not otherwise specified), and 45 lacerations (38
of which required sutures). In addition,
there were 7 reports of contusions on elbows or knees. The EB05 (2.28) for syncope was the only positive signal identified with EBGM methods.
Headaches

There were 937 reports of headaches after qHPV vaccination (Table 2). These
accounted for 7.7% of the total AEFIs
reported. One hundred fifty of these reports (16%) were coded as serious. The
most common reason for being classified as a “serious” report was hospitalization for neurologic evaluation after
a syncope-related fall.
Hypersensitivity Reactions

There were 725 reports with a coding
term indicative of hypersensitivity
(Table 2). Review of the reports showed
that 31 reports were coded incorrectly. In addition, there was 1 hearsay case that could be not evaluated,
leaving 693 total hypersensitivity cases.
Of the 693 hypersensitivity reports, 416
(60%) were from the manufacturer, 178

(26%) were from the health care professional, 24 (3%) were from a parent
or patient, and 75 (11%) were from an
“other” source.
Hypersensitivity reports included 600
of urticaria (87%); 95 rash (14%); 95
pruritus (14%); 42 arthralgia (6%); 28
anaphylactic reaction (4%); 23 generalized rash (3%); 22 pruritic rash (3%);
and rare reports (⬍1%) of angioedema, dermatographism, serum sickness, bronchospasm, and eye swelling. Five hundred fifty-six reports
(80%) were attributed to qHPV alone.
The time interval between vaccination and onset of symptoms could not
be calculated for 150 reports. For the
reports where time interval was available, more than half of the cases were
reported on the same day as (n=246,
35%) or the next day after (n=126, 18%)
vaccination. The median onset interval
was 1 day with a range of 0 to 271 days.
No dose information was provided in
106 reports; 82 of these (77%) were

manufacturer reports. Most hypersensitivity reports (n=393, 78%) occurred
after dose 1, 160 (23%) occurred after
dose 2, and 53 (8%) occurred after dose
3. The overall RR was 3.1 of 100 000
doses distributed.
There were 600 reports of urticaria to
VAERS, including 178 reports (30%) of
generalized urticaria, 33 reports (5.5%)
associated with the injection site or arm,
114 (19%) on localized sites (including
42 on the upper body, 3 on the lower
body, 18 on the torso, 11 on the arms and
legs, 8 on the legs bilaterally, 10 on the
arms bilaterally, and 22 on the face/
head), and 8 reports (1%) of fewer than
10 hives scattered over the body. There
were 267 reports (44.5%) that did not
specify the location of the urticaria. Most
reports of urticaria (n=329, 55%) occurred after dose 1, 135 (22%) occurred after dose 2, and 46 (8%) occurred after dose 3. No dose information
was provided in 90 reports; 69 of these

median time interval from immunization to onset of symptoms was 17 days,
with a range of 8 to 49 days. The overall
RR was 2.6 cases per 100 000 doses
distributed.
There were 28 reports coded as anaphylaxis after qHPV (Table 2). Two
cases were hearsay reports without any
medical information, leaving 26 cases
for review. Seventeen of these cases
(65%) occurred after dose 1, 4 (15%)
occurred after dose 2, 1 case (4%) occurred after dose 3, and the dose number was unknown for 4 cases (15%). Review using the Brighton classification
criteria found that 7 (27%) did not meet
the criteria for anaphylaxis, 9 (35%) had
insufficient information, and 10 (38%)
met the Brighton anaphylaxis definition. Only 4 cases were of sufficient concern to be referred to an allergist.
Twenty-five cases occurred on the same
day as immunization. One case occurred 5 days after immunization; while
this case met the Brighton case definition, it was thought unlikely to be vaccine related due to the prolonged time
between immunization and onset of
symptoms. The overall RR was 0.1 case
per 100 000 doses distributed.
Guillain-Barré Syndrome

There were 42 cases of GBS reported to
VAERS (Table 2). Twenty-six of the reports were made by the manufacturer
with no identifying information to enable clinical review of the cases. After
FDA contact of the manufacturer to request information on these cases of interest, additional medical information
was obtained on 13 cases (50%). One
reporter refused to provide the manufacturer with any identifying information. Six cases were hearsay reports and
no further information could be obtained. No further identifying information was provided on 5 cases. Review
of the 21 cases with available clinical
information showed that 12 cases (57%)
met the Brighton case definition, 1 case
(5%) initially thought to be an atypical case of GBS was diagnosed as amyotropic lateral sclerosis at autopsy, 2
cases (10%) lacked sufficient detail for
complete evaluation, 5 (24%) re754

ported events did not meet the Brighton case definition, and 1 case (5%) occurred prior to vaccination. Medical
records are still being collected for the
11 recent cases.
Eleven of 12 confirmed cases were
patients aged between 13 and 30 years.
Six patients had received qHPV alone;
4 received qHPV and quadrivalent meningococcal conjugate vaccine; 1 received qHPV, quadrivalent meningococcal conjugate vaccine, and hepatitis
A vaccine; and 1 received qHPV, quadrivalent meningococcal conjugate vaccine, and varicella vaccine. Onset intervals for the 12 definite cases ranged
from 0 to 145 days. Only 8 of the confirmed cases were within the 4- to 42day window of biological plausibility.18 The RR of GBS following qHPV
was 0.3 confirmed cases per 100 000
person-years. The PRR for GBS after
qHPV in 6- to 29-year-olds compared
with all other vaccines in 6- to 29-yearolds was 0.4. This PRR did not meet the
screening criteria for signal detection.
Transverse Myelitis

There were 10 cases of transverse myelitis reported to VAERS (Table 2). Two
cases had insufficient information for adequate clinical review and 1 case was diagnosed as multiple sclerosis. All 7 confirmed transverse myelitis cases were
found after qHPV vaccine alone. The age
distribution of cases was 13 to 26 years.
One case occurred after dose 1, and 6
cases occurred after dose 2. Only 1 case
occurred within the theoretical 4- to 42day window of biological plausibility.18
Motor Neuron Disease

There were 3 reports to VAERS of young
females who presented with a rapidly
progressing neurologic disorder occurring some months after receipt of the
qHPV vaccine. One of these reports was
a hearsay report (a fifth-hand report) that
could not be identified and might represent 1 of the other 2 cases. Autopsy
confirmed a diagnosis of amyotropic lateral sclerosis (anterior motor neuron disease) in 1 case. The other young female
died in 2009. The autopsy findings on
this case are still pending.

Venous Thromboembolic Events

Based on MedDRA search terms of venous thrombosis, thrombosis, embolism,
pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary thrombosis, and embolic
stroke, there were 56 reports of VTEs after qHPV, for an RR of 0.2 case per
100 000 doses. Ten cases were hearsay
reports that could not be confirmed or
clinically evaluated, 9 reports were related to “clots with menses” and were
not VTEs, 5 were manufacturer reports
with no identifying information for follow-up, 1 report had insufficient information available for adequate evaluation, and 31 reports had sufficient
information for clinical review. There
were 5 reports of deep vein thrombosis
alone, 7 reports of deep vein thrombosis with pulmonary embolism, 12 reports of pulmonary embolism without
deep vein thrombosis, 4 reports of cerebrovascular accidents, 1 report of superior mesenteric vein thrombosis, and 2
reports of superior sagittal venous
thrombosis. There were 4 deaths reported among the 19 pulmonary embolism cases (21%).
Thirty of 31 reports (97%) were associated with qHPV immunization alone.
The mean age of individuals reported to
have VTEs after qHPV immunization was
21 years (median, 20 years; range, 15-39
years). The number of doses preceding
the diagnosis of a VTE included 9 cases
after dose 1, 11 cases after dose 2, and
10 cases after dose 3; dose number was
unknown for 1 case. The mean time between qHPV immunization and diagnosis was 41.5 days (median, 23 days;
range, 0-306 days).
Risk factors included estrogencontaining birth control (n=20), family history (n=10), history of smoking
(n=2), immobility (n=7), overweight
(n=6), increased triglycerides (n=1),
history of surgery (n = 1), pregnancy
(n=2), trauma from surfing (n=1), and
hyperviscosity from diabetic ketoacidosis (n=1). Twenty-eight of 31 cases
(90%) had a known risk factor for
VTEs. Twenty-two of 31 cases (71%)
were tested for hypercoagulability; 10
were positive, including 2 cases
with factor V Leiden deficiency, 2 cases

with methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase deficiency, 1 case with methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase deficiency
with increased homocysteine levels, 1
case with the prothrombin gene mutation with methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase deficiency, 1 case with a prothrombin mutation and increased
homocysteine levels, and 2 cases of antiphospholipid syndrome. All 10 cases
with hypercoagulability had a known
risk factor for VTEs, including 7 with
a history of taking estrogen-containing birth control medications.
The PRR for 6- to 17-year-olds was 4.8
(␹2 =4.16, P=.04). The PRR for 18- to 29year-olds was 6.7 (␹2 =7.48, P=.006).
Both of these age groups met the screening criteria for signal detection.
Pancreatitis

There were 10 reports coded as pancreatitis in VAERS. One case was ultimately diagnosed with multiple ovarian cysts as the cause of the patient’s right
lower quadrant pain, leaving 9 reports
of pancreatitis. All of the cases had risk
factors for pancreatitis, including gallstones (n = 2), alcohol use (n = 1), increased triglycerides (n=1), viral infection (Coxsackie) (n = 1), estrogen use
(n=2), and mild obesity (n=2). All cases
were hospitalized, meeting the FDA definition of a serious AEFI. Three cases presented after dose 1, 3 after dose 2, and 3
after dose 3. Two of the individuals who
presented after dose 1 had resolution of
symptoms but experienced subsequent
exacerbations after doses 2 and 3. It was
not possible to do any statistical comparisons because of low numbers.
Autoimmune Disorders

There were 51 reports of autoimmune
disorders to the VAERS system, including 26 reports of autoimmune disorder (not otherwise specified), 1 report
of scleroderma, 1 report of dermatomyositis, 18 reports of systemic lupus
erythematosus, 13 reports of rheumatoid arthritis, 1 report of Sjögren syndrome, and 4 reports of mixed connective tissue disease. Fifty-one of these
reports (88%) were associated with
qHPV vaccine alone.

Pregnancy

There were 236 VAERS reports of qHPV
given shortly before or during pregnancy. Twelve of the AEFI reports were
coded as serious; 10 required hospitalization due to miscarriage and 2 cases
included a life-threatening illness (1
deep vein thrombosis and 1 severe vaginal hemorrhage after emergency dilation and curettage). Two hundred
twenty-eight reports (97%) were received from the manufacturer through
the Merck Pregnancy Registry.
One hundred forty-three of the reports were coded as miscarriage (spontaneous abortion), including 1 molar
pregnancy. There were 75 reports of
elective termination of pregnancy following administration of qHPV. None
of the reports described receipt of qHPV
having influenced the decision to terminate the pregnancy. There were 13
deliveries of normal, healthy infants; 3
ectopic pregnancies; and 2 unknown
pregnancy outcomes.
Deaths

There were 32 VAERS reports of death
following qHPV vaccination (Table 2).
Eight of the reports were second-hand
reports that could not be verified. Four
were manufacturer reports with no
identifying information for confirmation or medical review. Twenty of the
reports (62.5%) could be verified
through clinical review of medical records and autopsy reports. Of these
cases, 14 (70%) were after qHPV alone.
The other 6 cases reported qHPV as well
as a variety of other vaccines. Nine cases
occurred after dose 1, 5 after dose 2, and
6 after dose 3.
Mean age was 18 years (median, 17
years; range, 12-26 years). There was
no clustering by age. The mean time
from last qHPV immunization to AEFI
onset was 39 days (median, 14.5 days;
range, 2-288 days). The mean time from
last qHPV immunization to death was
47 days (median, 14.5 days; range, 2 to
405 days).
Causes of death included 4 unexplained deaths, 2 cases of diabetic ketoacidosis (1 complicated by pulmonary embolism), 1 case related to

prescription drug abuse, 1 case of juvenile amyotropic lateral sclerosis, 1
case of meningoencephalitis (Neisseria meningitidis serogroup B), 1 case of
influenza B viral sepsis, 3 cases of pulmonary embolism (1 associated with
hyperviscosity due to diabetic ketoacidosis), 6 cardiac-related deaths (4 arrhythmias and 2 cases of myocarditis), and 2 cases due to idiopathic
seizure disorder.
The PRR for deaths in 6- to 17-yearolds was 1.4 (␹2 =0.42, P=.52). The PRR
for deaths in 8- to 29-year-olds was 1.2
(␹2 =0.01, P=.92). Neither of these met
the screening criteria for signal detection.
COMMENT
Our review of 12 424 reports of AEFIs
following receipt of qHPV after licensure found that most did not meet the
FDA definition of serious. The safety
profile described by these data for frequent AEs is consistent with prelicensure data, with the exception of syncope and VTEs. This review summarizes
passive surveillance data from more
than 23 million doses distributed in the
United States. Such postlicensure monitoring allows for the potential detection of rare AEFIs as more people
are vaccinated. As expected with
increased numbers of immunizations in
the postlicensure setting, rare AEFIs
were observed more often than in the
prelicensure review.
Ongoing monitoring will help assess whether the serious reports to
VAERS, as well as the few serious AEs
identified during prelicensure trials, require further evaluation.22 The Vaccine Safety Datalink is providing additional surveillance through the use of
rapid cycle analyses to monitor for seizures, syncope, anaphylaxis, appendicitis, GBS, and VTEs.23 Important identified concerns from either VAERS or
the Vaccine Safety Datalink can be investigated using well-designed, systematic, hypothesis-driven studies.
Reported deaths with available records, autopsy reports, or death certificates describe causes other than recent vaccination. Two of 3 VTE death

reports described the use of oral contraceptives, which can increase the risk
of VTE 3- to 6-fold.24 Because the population of young women who frequently use hormonal contraceptives
overlaps with those receiving the qHPV
vaccine, coincidental occurrences of
VTE among qHPV recipients may be
anticipated. Nonetheless, close monitoring continues for VTE reports to
VAERS following qHPV and other vaccines.
Vasovagal syncope is among the most
frequently reported AEFIs following
qHPV. When it results in falls, significant traumatic injuries can occur.25,26
The ACIP and Red Book have published guidelines to prevent vasovagal
syncope and related injury following
vaccination.27,28 After several newly licensed adolescent vaccines (qHPV;
quadrivalent meningococcal conjugate vaccine; and tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis vaccine) were added to the
routine immunization schedule, the
number of postvaccination syncope reports to VAERS increased, primarily
among females aged 11 to 18 years.29
This age group also has a higher background rate of syncope than other age
groups. The predominance of females
could be related to an actual difference between the sexes or could represent reporting bias since the qHPV
vaccine is currently licensed for females only. With the increased use of
adolescent vaccines, we strongly urge
vaccine providers to diligently implement the ACIP recommendations for a
routine 15-minute waiting period following vaccination. There have been reports in the literature documenting seizure-like activity during syncope in
children.30,31 Some reports to VAERS of
seizures may be anoxic seizures resulting from syncopal episodes.
Reports of VTEs after qHPV immunization should be interpreted with caution due to the multiple limitations of
a passive reporting system and the potential effect of widespread media coverage stimulating reporting. These cases
occurred over a wide time interval after immunization, and 90% reported a
756

known risk factor for VTEs. It is difficult to establish a potential window of
biological plausibility since the time
frame between risk factor exposure and
clot formation is unknown. We did not
detect any signal for VTEs through data
mining or in the Vaccine Safety
Datalink. Continued monitoring will be
done for cases in VAERS, the Vaccine
Safety Datalink, and potential future
studies.
Our review of definite and possible
GBS reports revealed a lower RR (0.3/
100 000 estimated person-years based
on dose distribution) than the background incidence rate of GBS in 9- to
26-year-old females (1.57/100 000 person-years). We did not detect any signal for GBS through data mining or in
the Vaccine Safety Datalink, although
the extent of underreporting to VAERS
is not known.20
Because there are no adequate and
well-controlled studies in pregnant
women, and animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human
response, qHPV is not recommended
for use in pregnant women.1 Exposures to qHPV during pregnancy have
been identified in VAERS. As agreed
with the FDA at the time of licensure,
the vaccine manufacturer established a
voluntary pregnancy registry to monitor outcomes among women vaccinated with qHPV during the month
prior to conception or during pregnancy.1 This pregnancy registry is more
complete than VAERS reporting and includes continued follow-up of cases.
Although VAERS shares inherent
limitations of all passive surveillance
systems, it is national in scope and can
provide important signals that may require further attention. 8 However,
VAERS data need to be interpreted with
caution, because not all reported events
are systematically validated, and many
may have only coincidentally followed vaccination. In addition, data
limitations include underreporting, inconsistency in the quality and completeness of reported data, stimulated
reporting due to extensive news coverage, and reporting biases.7 The VAERS
reporting rate for qHPV is triple the rate

for all other vaccines combined, perhaps reflecting greater public attention to HPV than the usual increased
reporting following licensure of a new
product (“Weber effect”).32,33 AEFI reporting rates also need cautious interpretation, because vaccine distribution data do not allow calculation of
age-specific reporting rates and do not
provide the numbers of doses actually
administered.
A further limitation of VAERS reports after qHPV is that a large proportion (68%) come from the manufacturer and most of these reports (89%)
do not include sufficient identifying information to allow medical review of the
individual cases. For example, when additional clinical information was available for review, approximately onehalf of the cases of GBS and transverse
myelitis were not confirmed.
Postlicensure safety surveillance of
qHPV supplements data from the prelicensure randomized clinical trials. Ongoing VAERS monitoring also complements 2 large ongoing postlicensure
observational safety studies: the CDCsponsored Vaccine Safety Datalink
“rapid cycle analysis” and a phase IV
study agreed on by the manufacturer
and the FDA at the time of vaccine
licensure. 1,34 The latter study will
provide data on the safety of simultaneous use of qHPV with other recommended vaccines, as well as autoimmune and serious AEFIs reported
after qHPV vaccination. The pregnancy registry will continue for at least
5 years.
CONCLUSION
Vaccination with qHPV has the potential to decrease the global morbidity and
mortality of HPV-associated diseases,
including cervical cancer. After hepatitis B vaccine, which can prevent liver
cancer, qHPV is only the second vaccine licensed with an indication to prevent cancer. The postlicensure safety
profile presented here is broadly consistent with safety data from prelicensure trials. Because VAERS data must
be interpreted cautiously and cannot
generally be used to infer causal asso-
