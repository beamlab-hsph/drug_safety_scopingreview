Abstract: The pharmacovigilance databases consist of several case reports
involving drugs and adverse events (AEs). Some methods are applied consistently
to highlight all signals, i.e. all statistically significant associations between a drug
and an AE. These methods are appropriate for verification of more complex
relationships involving one or several drug(s) and AE(s) (e.g; syndromes or
interactions) but do not address the identification of them. We propose a method
for the extraction of these relationships based on Formal Concept Analysis (FCA)
associated with disproportionality measures. This method identifies all sets of
drugs and AEs which are potential signals, syndromes or interactions. Compared
to a previous experience of disproportionality analysis without FCA, the addition
of FCA was more efficient for identifying false positives related to concomitant
drugs.

1. Introduction
Detecting unexpected relationships between drugs and adverse events (AEs) from a
pharmacovigilance database is a real challenge. Automated signal detection consists in
application of data mining algorithms to help identification of signals, i.e. all
statistically significant {drug, AE} couples, which are numerous and should be reduced
to the most plausible [1]. Indeed, these potential signals extracted from a database are
only assumptions; they should lead to more complex and expensive pharmacological
studies. Therefore, it’s important not to ignore any relationships but avoid an excess of
studying situations.
Several types of relationships can be identified from the database: (i) {drug, AE}
couples that data mining algorithms have mainly focused on; (ii) Relationships between,
two drugs and an AE which are potential drug interactions, (iii) Relationships between
several AEs and a drug which are potential syndromes, (iv) Relationships involving
several drug(s) and AE(s) which are frequently observed in protocols. Among
relationships between several drugs, cases where the drug association strengthens a
signal compared to both single drugs may be classified as a potential interaction. Cases
where there is no signal between one of the drugs and the AE are more difficult to

interpret and may be related to concomitant drugs: the first drug is responsible for the
AE but the second drug is only an innocent bystander which was associated to the first
drug by chance or due to a frequent therapeutic association.
Automated methods for detecting drugs-AEs relationships are based on calculation
of disproportionality measures. The statistical approach includes the Proportional
Reporting Ratio (PRR) [2], χ² often coupled with the PRR, and the Reporting Odds
Ratio [1]. The Bayesian approach consists of the Multi-item Gamma Poisson Shrinker
algorithm [3] and the Bayesian Confidence Propagation Neural Network [4]2. Recently,
van Puijenbroek et al have used these methods in the detection of drug interactions [5]
using a model based on logistic regression. These methods are appropriate for
verification of more complex relationships involving several drugs and/or AEs (e.g;
syndromes or interactions) but do not address the identification of them. A syndrome
detected by case review involving Terbinafine and three AEs (arthralgia, urticaria and
fever) was verified using this model [6]. A couple of articles addressed verification of
already known drug interactions based on pharmacological knowledge. No systematic
research and verification of relationships involving several drugs and/or syndromes
was described in the literature with data mining algorithms.
Our new approach detects all kinds of drugs-AEs relationships thanks to an
exhaustive exploration of a pharmacovigilance database. It helps identifying situations
where drugs are prescribed together whereas a previous method [7] generated several
false positives due to the innocent bystanders. It is based on Formal Concept Analysis
(FCA) [8] combined with disproportionality measures. This article introduces briefly
FCA and its use in pharmacovigilance, and then presents the results of an application of
this method to an extract of the French pharmacovigilance database. We finally
conclude with a discussion of the results.

2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Fundamentals of Formal Concept Analysis (FCA)
The central notion in Formal Concept Analysis [8] is a hierarchical structure called
Concept Lattice where objects are classified following the attributes they own. The set
of objects ( ) and attributes ( ) together with their relation to each other (
)
is called a formal context
. Table in figure 1(a) defines a formal context for
adverse drug event exploration, where
is a set of patients and is the set of
attributes: sex (male and female), drugs that patients took (D1, D2, D3, D4, D5) and
adverse events (AE1, AE2). Two derivation operators, both denoted by ' link objects
and attributes. Let
and
then
and
. Two compound operators both noted " are defined by the
composition of the two ' operators (i.e. " = ' o '). They are closure operators over
(":
O→O) and
(": A→A). A pair of '-connected sets is called formal concept:
is a formal concept iff
and
.
and
are respectively the
extent and the intent of the concept. The set
of all concepts of the context is

concept lattice.
In the context given figure 1(a),
but, following the previous
definition, the formal concept built by closure is
. The lattice
has one top concept which extent groups all the objects of the context and,
by duality, one bottom concept which intent groups all the attributes of the context.
Objects in the extension of a concept are inherited from the bottom to the top of the
lattice. In a dual way, attributes are inherited from top to bottom. Figure 1(b) is the
concept lattice of the context (a). The concept
is named in
the lattice.

2.2. FCA and Adverse Drug Event Exploration
The intent of some formal concepts shows that some patients took a same set of drugs
and had the same set of AEs. In , four patients
took the drug
and
have the adverse event
. We also observe in the context that
, among others,
also took
but
is the only drug that the four patient
took. Thanks
to the closure operators used to build the concepts, the lattice gives all the drugs-AEs
relationships that exist in the data and no more. Among all the concepts, we distinguish
potential signals, when the intent includes only one drug and one AE (see
and );
potential drug interactions, when the intent includes two drugs and one AE (see
and ); and potential syndrome, when the intent includes one drug and several AEs
(see ).
Compared to extraction of {drug, AE } couples without FCA, the lattice – with its
formal concepts built using the closure operators – reduces the number of situations
drugs-AEs to study. In figure 1(b), patients
share the attributes
.
While disproportionality measures would propose two potential signals to study
(
and
), the lattice keeps only one (
) as
is not

shared by any group of patients. Of course, thresholds used in disproportionality
measures are not meaningful on such a small example.
All formal concepts are not relevant for adverse drug event exploration. Either they
do not describe a drug-AEs relationship or the described relationship is not statistically
significant. To keep statistically significant concepts when the intent includes drugs
and AEs, we combine the lattice with criteria used by the British Medicines and
Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA): χ² > 4, PRR > 2 and the number of
patients (the support) is greater or equal to 3 (see [2] for χ² and PRR calculation). The
a,b,c and d parameters for χ² and PRR calculation are calculated from the extent of
concepts in the lattice. We tested this method to a subset of 3249 cases from the French
database on AEs. Drugs where encoded as active ingredients and AEs where encoded
following the WHO-ART terminology. In that way, our database contains 527 drugs
and 639 AEs. First, the lattice has been built using the Galicia software and then, for
any concept whose support is higher than 3, we calculated both PRR and χ² values.

3. Results
The whole lattice has 13,178 concepts. For 842 of them, the intent includes at least one
drug and one AE. Relationships are investigated using MHRA criteria in a horizontal
strip of the lattice (see black circles in figure 2b). This remaining strip is delimited in
the upper part according to the meets, which are the first concepts of the lattice starting
from the top including both drugs and AEs in their intent. Delimitation in the lower
part is according to the support of concepts because we keep concepts including at least
three patients in their extent.

Table 1 shows five different kinds of drug-AEs detected relationship. 181 among
the 360 concepts expressing a potential signal are not restricted to a given population
(their intent do not include any patient properties, neither age nor sex) We evaluated a
sample of 95 of them: 61 signals where already known, for example {Abciximab,
Thrombopenia}; 34 were not described in the literature, for example {Lidocaine,
Tachycardia} and need further investigations. Among the 56 potential syndromes, 53
consisted of two AEs and three consisted of three AEs.

The lattice helps to identify 110 pairs of drugs that might be classified as drug
interactions. Among 57 pairs related to drugs commonly prescribed in therapeutic
associations, 34 were dedicated to anti-HIV prescriptions. In 8 cases the associated
drugs were likely to be prescribed successively rather than at the same time for
example heparin was prescribed first then replaced by enoxaparin.

4. Discussion and conclusion
We evaluated in this article the properties of the concept lattice for generating
potential relationships between one or several drugs and AEs. Sample size was
sufficient for generating several signals. Syndromes mainly consisted of two AEs. No
database on syndromes is available to verify their plausibility but we were able to
detect known patterns such as hypersensitivity to abacavir. FCA also highlighted more
complex relationships that are more difficult to interpret because they are associations
of more than two drugs and AEs. This could help the generation of signals related to a
whole protocol instead of single drugs. Due to sample size few drug interactions were
detected and the interest of the lattice was more focused on the identification of false
positives and concomitant drugs.
In a previous experience [7], disproportinality measures extracted 523 statistically
significant {drug, AE} couples with many false positives due to concomitant
prescription. The new approach generates only 360 signals. Indeed many signals
generated with the previous approach are now clustered in concept nodes of the lattice
that present higher order relations, i.e. several drugs and/or AEs. FCA helps to reduce:
1. The number of signals to review. For example the medicinal product
consisting of tiemonium + colchicine + opium generated a single signal for the
whole association whereas the previous method generated three different
signals related to each single active ingredient.
2. The number of false positives related to several active ingredients in the same
medicinal products. In previous method a signal of diarrhoea was generated

with opium whereas this active ingredient is added in small proportions to
colchicine in order to reduce the diarrhoea episodes. Compound active
ingredients are clustered by the current method and it is easier to interpret
diarrhoea as related to colchicine.
3. The number of false positives related to concomitant drugs. For example
sucralfate was no longer associated to thrombopenia while all patients taking
sucralfate were also prescribed heparin.
We showed how FCA may be combined with disproportionnality measures for the
identification of three kinds of relationships of great interest in pharmacovigilance:
signals, drug interactions and syndromes. Building formal concepts by closure with
FCA ensures that resulting relationships (signals, interactions and syndromes) are
relevant relationships present in data. Thus in the case of signals, the count of
associations the expert has to evaluate is reduced from the number of signals that
would be generated by a classical signal detection method.
The method we presented performs exhaustive search of the three kinds of existing
relationships in data. This suggests new relationships for evaluation by experts,
especially in the case of interactions and syndromes, present in data with no a priori of
the domain.
