Aim: To describe spontaneously reported cases of erectile dysfunction (ED) in association with
angiotensin II type I blockers (ARB) and other antihypertensive drugs.
Subjects and methods: All spontaneously reported cases of ED submitted to the Swedish
Medical Products Agency (MPA) between 1990 and 2006, where at least one antihypertensive
drug was the suspected agent, were scrutinized. Patient demographics, drug treatment and
adverse reactions were recorded. Using the Bayesian Confidence Propagation Neural Network
(BCPNN) method, the information component (IC) was calculated.
Results: Among a total of 225 reports of ED, 59 involved antihypertensive drugs including ARB
(9 cases) as suspected agents. A positive IC value was found indicating that ED was reported more
often in association with antihypertensive drugs classes, except for angiotensin-converting enzyme
inhibitors, compared with all other drugs in the database. Positive dechallenge was reported in 43
cases (72%).
Discussion: All classes of major antihypertensive drugs including ARB were implicated as
suspected agents in cases of ED. Few risk factors were identified. The relatively high reporting of ED in association with ARB is in contrast with previous studies, suggesting that ARB
have neither a positive nor any effect on ED. This discrepancy suggests that further studies are
warrnted on this potential adverse reaction to ARB.

Erectile dysfunction (ED), ie, the consistent or recurrent inability of a man to attain
and/or maintain penile erection sufficient for sexual activity,1 is a common disorder
with a reported prevalence between 13% and 46% in the general population and with
an exponential increase in occurrence from 60 years of age.2 Various medical, psychological and lifestyle factors have been implicated in the pathogenesis. Diabetes,
hypertension, hyperlipidemia, obesity, smoking, and lack of physical activity are
established risk factors for ED.3
Drugs can have adverse effects on sexual function in several dimensions: central
effects by sedation and loss of libido, central and peripheral effects by influencing
neurotransmitters and receptors.4 Use of antihypertensive drugs has been associated
with ED5 although the relationship has been disputed.6 Diuretics and adrenergic
beta-antagonists (beta-antagonists) have been reported to have negative outcomes on
various endpoints regarding sexual function. Calcium channel blockers (CCB) and
angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have not been associated with major

negative impact on ED. It has also been suggested that angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers (ARB) would affect sexual
function less than other antihypertensive treatment.2,7 Some
data even suggest that sexual function and ED may improve
during treatment with ARB.8–10
In view of the fact that studies are lacking, limited information is available from daily clinical practice, and ARBs
may differ in this respect from other antihypertensive drugs,
we wanted to study spontaneous reports of ED for different
groups of antihypertensive drugs. In addition, we wanted to
characterize cases of ED in terms of risk factors.

Methods
To study reports from clinical practice on ED during treatment with antihypertensive drugs, we reviewed spontaneous
reports in the Swedish adverse drug reaction (ADR) database
(SWEDIS). The groups of antihypertensive drugs were identified according to their ATC code (Anatomic Therapeutic
Chemical classification) as defined by the WHO Collaborating Center for Drug Statistics Methodology. ATC C03A
(thiazide diuretics), C07 AA and AB (beta-antagonists),
C08 (CCB), C09A (ACE inhibitors), and C09C (ARB)
were included. According to the Swedish Medical Products
Agency’s (MPA) code of statutes, it is mandatory for health
care professionals to report serious reactions, new and unexpected reactions and also those ADRs that seem to increase
in frequency. For new drugs reporting of all adverse effects
except those labeled as common in the Summary of Product
Characteristics (SPC) is encouraged. An ADR is defined by
the World Health Organization (WHO) as “a response to a
drug which is noxious and unintended, and that occurs at
doses normally used in humans for the prophylaxis, diagnosis,
or therapy of disease or for the modification of physiological
function”.
All cases of suspected ED associated with antihypertensive drugs reported to SWEDIS during the period 1990 to
2006 were identified and studied. In SWEDIS the following
information can be obtained in addition to the suspected drug
and the ADR: age, sex, concomitant medication, treatment
dates, indication for treatment, concurrent diseases, dosage,
and outcome of the reaction. Most reports also have a narrative. Drugs can be listed as being suspected of having caused
the reaction, as interacting with another prescribed drug, or as
concomitant medication not related to the ADR. Each report
can include more than one ADR and/or suspected drugs. The
causality of the suspected ADR is classified using WHO criteria (WHO Technical Report no 498, 1972). The reports are
handled at regional centers situated at six university hospitals

by an expert panel consisting of clinical pharmacologists and
specially trained nurses and pharmacists. Thereafter the cases
are re-evaluated at a national level by the MPA.
From the case reports the following information was
collected when available: sex, age, reporting date, suspected
drug(s), indication for treatment, duration of treatment,
concomitant medication, outcome of the reaction, and type
of reporter. Diabetes was identified when mentioned as
concurrent disease in the narrative or when an antidiabetic
drug was listed as concomitant.
Sales figures expressed as the number of defined daily
doses (DDD) for Sweden for the corresponding period were
obtained from the MPA. The DDD is the assumed average
daily dose for a drug prescribed for its main indication in
adults. The number of DDDs reflects the total sales, and not
for men only. The number of sold DDDs was transposed to
number of DDD years, one DDD year equalling the quantity
used to treat one person with one DDD daily for one year.
Using the Bayesian Confidence Propagation Neural Network (BCPNN) method, the strength of the statistical association between a suspected drug and an ADR in a database can
be calculated. This analysis provides a statistical indicator, the
information component (IC), which in this study was used
to assess the disproportionality between the observed and
the expected number of reports, given the number of reports
concerning the drug and the number of reports concerning the
ADR in question.11,12 The IC is a logarithmic measure, and a
positive IC-value with a positive (0) lower 95% confidence
limit indicates a statistically significant disproportionality. The BCPNN method has previously been described in
detail11 and has been thoroughly tested and evaluated.13,14
Moreover, the method has been found effective in identifying early drug safety signals.11 Due to the tentative nature
of the dataset, the method is used for hypothesis generation
rather than for hypothesis testing. In this study, the BCPNN
method was applied to SWEDIS reports concerning males
between 1990 and 2006.

Results
Among a total of 23,176 adverse drug reactions reported in
men during the 17-year study period, 225 (1%) reports of ED
were identified. Of these, 59 (26%) occurred during treatment
with antihypertensive drugs (Table 1). Most reports were
found for CCBs whereas thiazide diuretics were the least
reported. Concomitant antidiabetic drugs were mentioned in 4
(7%) reports. The median age was under 60 years for all ATCgroups, except for thiazide diuretics where the median age
was 65. All cases were reported by physicians. Hypertension

was listed as the indication for treatment in 43 (73%) of the
reports. Sixteen patients (27%) were treated with a combination of antihypertensive drugs from different ATC-classes.
In one case a beta-antagonist as well as a thiazide diuretic
was reported as suspected. In this report ED started when a
thiazide diuretic had been added to metoprolol, and improved
when metoprolol was withdrawn. This report is represented
in both the beta-antagonist group and in the thiazide group.
In the remaining reports only one antihypertensive drug was
reported as a suspected drug. One report describes a patient
that developed ED after generic substitution with metoprolol
(not represented in Table 1).
In one case, treatment was changed from felodipine to
enalapril, and in another report, treatment was changed from
ramipril to losartan, in both cases the change of therapy had
a beneficial effect on the ED. No concomitant medication

was mentioned in 15 (25%) reports, whereas information
on concomitant medication was missing or unknown in 9
(15%). In the group with beta-antagonists one patient was
treated concomitantly with tadalafil, a phosphodiesterase
type 5 (PDE5) enzyme inhibitor, and in the ACE inhibitor
group, one patient was treated with citalopram, a selective
serotonin reuptake inhibitor, a drug known to be able to
induce sexual dysfunction,15 both as concomitant medication
(both represented in Table 1).

Sweden was launched in 1994 and the first report on ED was
submitted in 1997, three reports were sent in 1999 and one
in each year 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003 and 2005, respectively.
All anti-hypertensives except ACE inhibitors demonstrate
statistically significant IC-values, indicating a higher number
of reports for ED than expected for these drugs. The highest
IC-values were observed for CCBs and thiazide diuretics
(Table 2).

Discussion
ED was reported in 1% of all ADR-reports for male subjects
during the study period. The different drug classes of antihypertensive drugs, including ARB, were all represented in
the reports. As the risk to develop ED increases with age, it
is noteworthy that the patients described in the reports were
quite young. However, the impact of cardiovascular disease
is greater among younger men with a higher probability of
ED.16 According to sales statistics for 2006 from the National
Board of Health and Welfare 55 to 60% of male users of thiazide diuretics, beta-antagonists, CCB, and ACE inhibitors are
over 65 years of age. For ARB 49% of the male users were
older than 65 (Official Statistics in Sweden, 2007 http://www.
socialstyrelsen.se/Publicerat/2007/9789/2007-46-4.htm
[in Swedish]). Surprisingly, a concomitant antidiabetic
medication was reported in only 4 out of 59 reports (7%).
This might reflect a reporting bias in terms of an increased
willingness to report ED if other risk factors such as high
age or diabetes are absent. A vast majority of the patients
were treated for hypertension, and ED is a known marker
for hypertension.6
ARB was launched in Sweden during the study period,
but we found no consistent reporting pattern, described as
the Weber effect,17 for suspected ARB induced ED. This is in
accordance with a previous study where no consistent reporting pattern was found for the overall reporting rate for ARB.18
ARB demonstrates the highest reporting rate of ED per million DDD years in comparison with other antihypertensive
drugs studied. This must however be interpreted in the light
of the overall ADR-reporting rate which was also highest for
this drug group (data not shown). There was a statistically
significant IC-value for all groups of antihypertensive drugs,
except ACE inhibitors, indicating a higher than expected
reporting rate of ED for these drugs. This is an interesting
finding in view of results from other studies suggesting a
positive effect of ARB on ED. In a study by Llisterri and
co-workers a group of uncontrolled hypertensive men with
sexual dysfunction was studied. After 12 weeks of treatment

with losartan the reported rate of ED decreased from 75%
to 12%.9 The claim that ARB have a positive effect on ED
can to a certain degree be supported by experimental data
showing that the human penile cavernous muscle tone is
partly balanced by angiotension II induced contraction,19
and by the suggestion that the ARB valsartan reversed ED
in diabetic rats.20
A number of limitations should be acknowledged when
interpreting data from spontaneous reporting systems. Information in the reports is often incomplete making it difficult
or impossible to establish causal relationships between the
reported event and the drug. Moreover, there is a substantial
underreporting of adverse events and the reporting is not
homogenous.21 The reporting rate is affected by numerous
factors. The severity of the reaction, whether the reaction is
a labeled ADR or not, and if the reaction is associated with a
newly launched drug, has been identified as important factors
for determining whether or not to report an ADR.22 In Sweden
ED is listed in the SPC (http://www.fass.se [in Swedish]) for
the majority of thiazide diuretics, beta-antagonists, CCB, and
ACE inhibitors. With the exception for irbersartan (Aprovel®;
Sanofi-Aventis), ED is not listed in the SPC for ARBs and
this may affect the willingness to report suspected ED for
ARBs in accordance to the rules for reporting in Sweden.
Moreover, there is also a possibility that ARBs are prescribed
selectively to men with a probability to develop ED. A further
problem with spontaneous reporting is to distinguish ADRs
from the symptoms and the natural history of underlying
diseases. Moreover, increased reporting of ED in association
with newer drugs may be due to the fact that sexual health has
been better recognized as a consequence of the introduction of
PDE5 enzyme inhibitor. When treatment is available asking
about sexual functions is likely to increase.23

Conclusion
All classes of major antihypertensive drugs including ARB
were implicated as suspected agents in spontaneously
reported cases of ED to the Swedish pharmacovigilance
system. Of all reports few risk factors such as high age and
diabetes were identified.The relatively high reporting of ED
in association with ARB is in contrast with previous studies
suggesting that ARB have no or a positive effect on ED. This
discrepancy suggests that further studies are warranted on
this potential adverse reaction to ARB.
