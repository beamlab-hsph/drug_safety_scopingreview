Abstract
Purpose:

The objective of our study was to conduct a data mining analysis to identify poten-

tial adverse events (AEs) following MENACWY‐D using the tree‐temporal scan statistic in the
Vaccine Safety Datalink population and demonstrate the feasibility of this method in a large distributed safety data setting.

Methods:

Traditional pharmacovigilance techniques used in vaccine safety are generally

geared to detecting AEs based on pre‐defined sets of conditions or diagnoses. Using a newly
developed tree‐temporal scan statistic data mining method, we performed a pilot study to evaluate the safety profile of the meningococcal conjugate vaccine Menactra® (MenACWY‐D),
screening thousands of potential AE diagnoses and diagnosis groupings. The study cohort
included enrolled participants in the Vaccine Safety Datalink aged 11 to 18 years who had
received MenACWY‐D vaccination(s) between 2005 and 2014. The tree‐temporal scan statistic
was employed to identify statistical associations (signals) of AEs following MENACWY‐D at a
0.05 level of significance, adjusted for multiple testing.

Results:

We detected signals for 2 groups of outcomes: diseases of the skin and subcutane-

ous tissue, fever, and urticaria. Both groups are known AEs following MENACWY‐D vaccination.
We also identified a statistical signal for pleurisy, but further examination suggested it was likely a
false signal. No new MENACWY‐D safety concerns were raised.

Conclusions:

As a pilot study, we demonstrated that the tree‐temporal scan statistic data

mining method can be successfully applied to screen broadly for a wide range of vaccine‐AE associations within a large health care data network.

Diagnosis tree

The tree‐temporal scan data mining method is conducted based on a
predefined tree structure. In this study, we used a hierarchical tree
structure defined by the Multi‐Level Clinical Classification Software
(MLCCS) (https://www.hcup‐us.ahrq.gov/toolssoftware/ccs/ccs.jsp).
The MLCCS is a diagnosis and procedure categorization scheme for
ICD‐9 codes. Four levels exist in this version of MLCCS. The first and
broadest of the 4 levels contains 18 body‐system categories. We added
a fifth level containing the individual ICD‐9 diagnosis codes. The fourth
MLCCS level was linked to particular ICD‐9 codes. In other words, we
used a hybrid of the structure imposed by both ICD‐9 and MLCCS.

Conditional tree‐temporal scan statistic

The conditional tree‐temporal scan statistic12 was used to identify any
potential AEs following MENACWY‐D vaccination in any potential risk
window. With this method, under the null hypothesis, conditioned on

The ratio of observed to expected (O/E) of AE outcome occurrences was also derived using this method. The analysis was implemented using treeScan software.16

the total number of cases for each AE in the follow‐up period, we
assume all AEs have the same probability of occurring on any particular
day. The probability for an AE to occur on a day equals the total number of AEs on that day divided by the total number of AEs during the
entire follow‐up period. This method makes within‐person comparisons, and therefore all time‐invariant confounders (such as race, sex,
site, etc.) were self‐adjusted. The conditional tree‐temporal scan test
statistic is analogous to a Poisson generalized log likelihood ratio
(LLR) test statistic. The formula is presented as
LLR ¼ Iðc>uÞ ðc ln½c=u þ ðN−cÞ ln½ðN−cÞ=ðN−uÞÞ
where n is the number of observed cases for a specific AE, c is the number of observed cases in the risk window for that AE, and N is the total

Signal evaluation and validation

We conducted post‐hoc tree‐temporal scan analyses for AEs following
well‐care visits as control outcomes when MENACWY‐D was not
administered. The rationale behind this is that common minor symptoms such as skin or eye‐related problems are often revealed and generate referrals during the same well‐care visits for adolescents, whether
or not MENACWY‐D is administered. If we found a signal for an AE following well‐care visits when MENACWY‐D was not given, this AE was
excluded in the primary analyses. In other words, we can use signals
following well‐care visits without MENACWY‐D administered to better
understand the baseline expectation for AEs that were detected.

of observed cases is greater than the expected, or 0 otherwise.
This test statistic was calculated for each AE and each possible risk
interval. Because the distribution of the test statistic is unknown
analytically, there is no mathematical formula available to calculate a
P‐value. Instead, we used Monte Carlo simulation to generate
99 999 random datasets to obtain the empirical distribution of the test
statistic under the null hypothesis. Datasets were generated in a way
that the total number of AEs on any specific day, summed over all
ICD‐9 codes, in each dataset was the same as in the real data set. Randomization was conducted by randomly permuting the days and the
ICD‐9 code, keeping the total number of AE cases fixed on each
day.12,15 For each generated dataset, we calculated the LLR for each

RESULTS

A total of 1 253 403 first doses of MENACWY‐D were included in the
analysis. Results for AEs following MENACWY‐D are presented in
Table 1. Out of 2 209 116 (4046 AEs × 546 risk intervals) AE‐risk interval combinations, 38 were significant with P‐values <0.05. Based on
the MLCCS tree structure, those 38 significant outcomes belong to
these broad groups: (1) disease of the nervous system and sense
organs (Figure 2; branch 6); (2) disease of the skin and subcutaneous
tissue (Figure 3; branch 12); (3) signs and ill‐defined conditions and factors influencing health status (Figure 4; branch 17); (4) diseases of the
respiratory system (Figure 5; branch 8); and others (including infectious
and parasitic disease, diseases of digestive system, disorders of lipid
metabolism, and other abnormal clinical findings). Among the 38 significant outcomes, a majority had a ratio of observed to expected (O/E)
AE outcome occurrences between 1 and 3, except for unspecified erythematous condition (ICD‐9 code 695.9) with an O/E ratio of 23.62,
cellulitis, and abscess of upper arm and forearm (ICD‐9 code 682.3
and its corresponding upper level MLCCS code 12.1.1.3) with an O/E
ratio of 19.42, and other ill‐defined and unknown causes of morbidity

DISCUSSION

In this study, we demonstrated that the tree‐temporal scan data mining
technique can be successfully used in a large electronic database, such
as the VSD, to monitor vaccine safety. We examined more than 1.2
million recipients of first dose of MENACWY‐D and identified 3
