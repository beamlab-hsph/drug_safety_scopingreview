ABSTRACT
Objective: The objective of the study was to identify possible toxic signal induced by cisplatin and carboplatin treatment by searching database
from Canadian Adverse Reaction Monitoring Program (CADRMP).

Methods: A total of 10429 reports of patients between January 1970 to March 2010 were downloaded from Canada Adverse reaction Monitoring
Program website. These reports contained information of adverse events associated with all other drugs inclusive of platinum compounds. Adverse
drug reaction (ADR) signal detection were determined by proportional reporting ratio (PRR), reporting odds ratio (ROR), PRR calculated by chisquare statistics, 95% confidence interval of PRR, observed to expected (O/E) ratio and De Mouchel method calculated PRR. Information component
(IC) was given by Bayesian confidence propagation neural network. (As per regulatory criteria, PRR ≥ 2 , ROR ≥ 1, chi -square statistics calculated
PRR ≥ 4 and lower bound of 95% CI of PRR ≥ 1 to consider particular adverse drug reaction as a signal. Further by BCPNN method, if IC − 2SD ≤ 0
then that drug-ADR pair considered as no signal; if 0<IC − 2SD ≤1.5, then that drug-ADR pair considered as weak signal; if 1.5<IC−2SD ≤ 3.0, then
that drug-ADR pair considered as middle signal; if IC − 2SD>3.0, then that drug-ADR pair considered as strong signal).
Results: A total of 28 reports of cisplatin-induced ototoxicity and 122 reports of carboplatin-induced pruritis were obtained from CADRMP
database. For cisplatin, the PRR was found to be 53.44 and by the Du Mouchel Method it was 20.7977. Further, the PRR calculated by chi-square
statistics was 544.70 whereas the lower and upper limits of 95% CI of PRR was found to be 3.67 and 4.57, respectively. The O/E ratio was found to
be 20.9130 and ROR was found to be 55.03 for cisplatin-induced ototoxicity. For carboplatin, the PRR was found to be 7.04412 and by the Du
Mouchel Method it was 16.4360. Further, the PRR calculated by chi-square statistics was 623.36645 whereas the lower and upper limits of 95% CI
of PRR was found to be 2.9167 and 3.6475, respectively. The O/E ratio was found to be 16.43854 and reporting odds ratio was found to be 7.6065
for carboplatin-induced pruritis. The value of IC-2SD was 2.9141 indicates middle signal for cisplatin-induced ototoxicity. However, the value of IC2SD is 2.1995 indicates middle signal for carboplatin-induced pruritis.
Conclusion: The signal of ototoxicity coupled with cisplatin and of pruritis coupled with carboplatin was found significant enough to induce
ototoxicity and pruritis respectively in the Canadian population.
Keywords: Cisplatin, Carboplatin, Signal detection, Ototoxicity, Pruritis.

INTRODUCTION
Cancer is a leading cause of death worldwide, accounting for 7.6
million deaths (around 13% of all deaths) [1]. Only 5–10% of all
cancer cases can be attributed to genetic defects, whereas the
remaining 90–95% have their roots in the environment and lifestyle.
The lifestyle factors include cigarette smoking, diet (fried foods, red
meat), alcohol, sun exposure, environmental pollutants, infections,
stress, obesity, and physical inactivity. The evidence indicates that of
all cancer-related deaths, almost 25–30% are due to tobacco, as
many as 30–35% are linked to diet, about 15–20% are due to
infections, and the remaining percentage are due to other factors
like radiation, stress, physical activity, environmental pollutants
etcetera [2]. Platinum analogues have become the mainstay of
treatment for many tumors including ovarian cancer, lung cancer,
germ cell tumors, head and neck cancer, bladder cancer and to a
lesser degree breast cancer and gastric cancer. Cisplatin was
introduced into clinical practice with a toxicity profile characterized
by nausea and vomiting, renal dysfunction and neurotoxicity and
ototoxicity. Carboplatin was the second clinically important
platinum analogue. Carboplatin is less nephrotoxic and less
emetogenic than cisplatin and neurotoxicity and ototoxicity are
virtually absent. Myelosuppression is the major toxic effect of
carboplatin and combining carboplatin with other cytotoxic agents
may be complicated [3, 4].

Number of adverse event reports (AERs) has been submitted to the
US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to confirm a relation
between platinum agents and hypersensitivity reactions. This
database created on the basis of reports to the FDA by health
professionals, consumers, and manufacturers. This system is

referred to as the Adverse Event Reporting System (AERS). These
results were evaluated quantitatively by signal detection, where a
signal means a drug-associated adverse event [5]. Signal-detection
algorithms (SDAs) are recognized as major tools in
pharmacovigilance. However, their performance characteristics are
generally unknown. By leveraging a unique gold standard recently
made public by the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership
(OMOP) and by conducting a unique systematic evaluation, we
provide new insights into the diagnostic potential and
characteristics of SDAs that are routinely applied to the US Food and
Drug Administration (FDA) Adverse Event Reporting System (AERS)
[6]. The objective of the study was to identify possible toxic signal
detection (SD) of cisplatin and carboplatin by searching database
from Canadian Adverse Reaction Monitoring Program (CADRMP).
MATERIALS AND METHODS

Data collection from public database
The CADRMP is the Health Canada post-marketing surveillance
program which collects and assesses suspected adverse reaction
reports for Canadian marketed health products such as cisplatin and
carboplatin. Date was extracted from Canadian Adverse Drug
Reaction Monitoring Program. For extraction following sections
were serially accessed from health Canada website (http://www.
hc-sc. gc. ca/index-eng. php): Drug and health products and Med
Effect Canada Adverse Reactions [7]. Finally, in the section of Canada
vigilance program, the CADRMP online database was extracted.
Procedure followed for signal detection in this study

Individual Case Safety Reports (ICSRs) in this database were

Singhal et al.
Int J Pharm Pharm Sci, Vol 7, Issue 6, 405-411
collected from the official website of health Canada. The text freely
available was converted into a structured format. On the structured
format statistical methods were applied to calculate an actual
measure of signals. Therapeutic class-specific SD calculations were
then carried out as shown in fig. 1. Signal detection analysis were
performed by different methods. These methods of calculations
were selected following a systematic literature review [8-10]. In the
present study attempt was made to maintain the originality of data
collected from CADRMP database while computing actual standard
deviation (SD).

a = Targeted event (Y) associated with targeted drug

b = Other adverse drug reactions (ADRs) associated with targeted drug
c = Targeted event (Y) associated with other than targeted drug

d = Other adverse drug reactions (ADRs) with other than targeted drug

The Chi-square (χ2) statistic calculated PRR

The Chi-square statistic was applied to test the independence of
categorical variables [9]. χ2 was used as an alternative measure of
heterogeneity in the contingency table which built with the
medicinal product X and the adverse event Y. PRR calculated by chisquare statistics was calculated as follows:

95% confidence interval of the PRR calculation
The standard error of the natural logarithm of the PRR was
estimated based on the following formula:

Fig. 1: Procedure followed for signal detection by statistical and
quantitative methods
Calculation of signal detection
Disproportionality
These are the frequency or relative frequency of a particular drug–
event pair. The signal would be considered significant if the statistics
from different calculations such as Proportional Reporting Ratio
(PRR), Reporting Odds Ratio (ROR), PRR calculated by chi-square
statistics (χ2), the 95% confidence interval for PRR (lower limit and
upper limit), the observed-to-expected (O/E ratio) and Du-Mouchel
method calculated PRR exceeded a certain value ((As per regulatory
criteria, PRR ≥ 2 , ROR ≥ 1, chi -square statistics calculated PRR ≥ 4
and lower bound limit of 95% CI of PRR≥ 1 to consider particular
adverse drug reaction as a signal. Further by BCPNN method, if IC−
2SD ≤ 0 then that drug -ADR pair considered as no signal; if 0<IC −
2SD ≤1.5, then that drug -ADR pair considered as weak signal; if
1.5<IC−2SD ≤ 3.0, then that drug-ADR pair considered as middle
signal; if IC − 2SD>3.0, then that drug-ADR pair considered as strong
signal), then the signal would be considered significant [9].
PRR calculation

As shown in table 1 and table 2, a 2*2 contingency table was
prepared to capture the incidences (targeted event Y) of Ototoxicity
(for cisplatin) or Pruritis (for carboplatin) and all other events for
the targeted drug X, i.e., Cisplatin or Carboplatin, in the database to
calculate PRR [8]. After that, the PRR was calculated as follows:
a = Targeted event (Y) associated with targeted drug

b = Other adverse drug reactions (ADRs) associated with targeted drug
c = Targeted event (Y) associated with other than targeted drug

d = Other adverse drug reactions (ADRs) with other than targeted drug

ROR calculation

The procedure is followed to calculate ROR was similar to that of the
PRR method [8]. The same contingency table (table 1 and table 2)
prepared for PRR, was also followed in the case of ROR calculations.
The ROR was calculated as follows:

A = Targeted event (Y) associated with targeted drug

B = Targeted event (Y) associated with other than targeted drug

C = Targeted event (Y) and other adverse drug reactions (ADRs)
associated with targeted drug

D = Targeted event (Y) and other adverse drug reactions (ADRs)
associated with other than targeted Drug

The 95% CI for ln (PRR) was then estimated as ln (PRR)±1.96SE, and
its exponential was taken [12]. The 95% confidence interval of the
PRR can be calculated as per below equation:
Lower and upper limits of 95% CI for PRR = {PRR/exp (1.96SE),
PRR/exp (1.96SE)} [5]
The observed-to-expected (O/E) ratio calculation

The O/E was [11] calculated as follows:
A = Targeted event (Y) associated with targeted drug

B = Other adverse drug reactions (ADRs) associated with targeted drug
C = Targeted event (Y) associated with other than targeted drug

D = Other Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) with other than targeted drug
Du Mouchel Method for PRR calculation

This method was based on 2*2 contingency table values as well as
the ratio of values of A and expected A was taken into consideration
for calculations. The PRR as per Du Mouchel Method was calculated
as per below equation:
A = Targeted Event (Y) associated with Targetted Drug

B = Other Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs) associated with Targetted
Drug
C = Targeted Event (Y) associated with other than Targetted Drug

D = Other Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs) with other than Targetted
Drug
N = Total sum of adverse drug reactions associated with drug and
other than Targetted Drug

Signal detection by bayesian confidence propagation neural
network method (BCPNN)
BCPNN has been chosen for ADR signal detection which realized
through calculating the Information Components (IC) compared the
calculating IC value with the BCPNN corresponding evaluation
standard of signal detection to judge if the signal established or not
[11]. The specific algorithm of BCPNN as follows:
Ncomb (Ci) = A= Targeted Event (Y) associated with Targetted Drug

Ndrug (Cj) = A+B= Targeted Event (Y) and Other Adverse Drug
Reactions (ADRs) associated with Targetted Drug
Nadr(Ck) = A+C = Targeted Event (Y) associated with drug and other
than Targetted Drug

Ntot(C) = A+B+C+D= Total sum of adverse drug reactions associated
with drug and other than Targetted Drug
And considering: λ = 1, α = β = 1, ɳ = δ = 2. Following different
formulas used for signal detection by BCPNN methods
IC = log2 ((Ncomb+0.5)/(Nadr/Ntot*Ndrug+0.5))

γ = λ(N+δ)(N+ɳ)/(Cj+α)(Ck+β)

E(IC) = log2 (Ci+λ)(N+δ)(N+ɳ)/(N+γ)(Cj+α)(Ck+β) = log2 Ɣ(Ci+λ)/(N+γ)

V(IC) = N-Ci+γ–δ/(Ci+λ) (1+N+λ)+N-Cj+δ–α/(Cj+α) (1+N+δ)+NCk+ɳ-β/(Cj+β) (1+N+ɳ)

Statistical calculation

The statistical significance of PRR, ROR, Chi-square calculated PRR,
O/E ratio, Du-Mouchel calculated PRR and information component
statistics by BCPNN method was based on regulatory guidelines [9].
RESULTS

Proportional reporting ratio (PRR) and Reporting odds ratio
(ROR)
The total of 10429 patient’s reports were extracted from CADRMP.
970 reports of adverse event associated with cisplatin inclusive
ototoxicity and 1442 reports of adverse event associated with
carboplatin inclusive pruritis were noted. The relevant details for
calculation of PRR and ROR are mentioned in table 1 and table 2 and
table 3 and table 4. The signal detected with the help of
“Proportional reporting ratio” for ototoxicity associated with
cisplatin was found to be 53.44 and “Reporting Odds Ratio” for
Ototoxicity associated with cisplatin was found to be 55.0370.
However, the PRR with the help of Du Mouchel Method was found to
be 20.9130.

For carboplatin, the signal detected with the help of “Proportional
reporting ratio” for Pruritis associated with carboplatin was found
to be 7.04412 and “Reporting Odds Ratio” for Pruritis associated
with carboplatin was found to be 7.6065. However, the PRR with the
help of Du Mouchel Method was found to be 16.4360.

As per above results for cisplatin and carboplatin, the value of PRR
was ≥ 2 and value of ROR was ≥ 1 indicate toxic signal for ototoxicity
associated with cisplatin and pruritis associated with carboplatin.

and 2010 and however highest cases of pruritis were reported
between 1996 to 2000.

Males were prone to cisplatin-ototoxicity whereas females were
prone to carboplatin associated with pruritis. The results of agestratified cases of cisplatin-induced ototoxicity and carboplatininduced pruritis were mentioned in table fig. 4 and fig. 5,

Statistical analysis
As per statistical analysis by SAS version 9.2 software, the chi-square
value was observed 544.70 for cisplatin and 486.62 for carboplatin
which was further supported by p value 0.001 which showed
significant signal of ototoxicity associated with cisplatin and pruritis
associated with carboplatin.
DISCUSSION

The Canadian Adverse Drug Reaction Monitoring Program (CADRMP)
of the Marketed Health Products Directorate (MHPD) of Health Canada
collects reports of suspected adverse events to health products
(including pharmaceuticals, biologics, natural health products, and
radiopharmaceuticals) marketed in Canada. Adverse events include
adverse reactions and medication incidents. Adverse reactions are
noxious and unintended responses and include any undesirable
patient effects suspected to be associated with the use of health
products. Medication incidents are preventable events that may cause
or lead to inappropriate use or patient harm, and are the most
common (known) single preventable cause of patient injury [12].
Pharmacovigilance analysis aims to search for previously unknown
patterns and automatically detect important signals, i.e., drugassociated adverse events, from such a large database. Recently
developed data mining tools for pharmacovigilance have been
successful at detecting signals that could not be found by individual
case reviews and that warrant further investigation together with
continuous surveillance. For this reason, data mining tools are being
routinely used for pharmacovigilance, supporting signal detection
and decision-making at companies, regulatory agencies, and
pharmacovigilance centers [13-19]. Despite of limitation to report
spontaneously, the CADRMP is the wealthy resource and the data
mining tools provide a string means of identifying potential
associations between drugs and adverse events.

Cancer chemotherapeutic drugs like cisplatin have a very high
potential for drug toxicity [20]. However, the number of ADR reports
from the cancer wards to the pharmacovigilance center of our
hospital was minimal. The reason for this paradox was not clear. It
could be either due to gross underreporting of adverse drug
reactions or due to effective preventive measures being adopted for
the patients receiving cancer chemotherapy. Platinum compounds
(cisplatin and carboplatin) are most commonly used drugs for
cancer chemotherapy. Cisplatin is a commonly used anti neoplastic
agent. Some of the well documented cisplatin-induced ADRs include
nausea, vomiting,renal toxicity, ototoxicity, peripheral neuropathy,
hypersensitivity reactions and electrolyte disturbances [20].

Cisplatin-induced nausea and vomiting are preventable ADRs due to
better predictability and thorough mechanisms to explain their
cause. However, ADRs such as ototoxicity, hypersensitivity reactions,
and electrolyte disturbances are not preventable due to the poor
predictability of the ADRs, poorly understood mechanisms and due to
lack of reporting of these ADRs.[20] However, as per previous certain
reports, it is concluded that cisplatin-induced ototoxicity is due to
genetic variants of thiopurine Smethyltransferase (TPMT) and
catechol O-methyltransferase (COMT) [21]. As per recent study in
India, 9.8 percentage of patients reported ototoxicity possibly due to
cisplatin [20]. Recent study at Cape Town, authors reported that
cisplatin shows associated with a high incidence of ototoxicity,
characterized by irreversible bilateral hearing loss and affecting 2350% of adults who receive the drug [22].

Hypersensitivity reactions (HSRs) are considered uncommon during
treatment with anticancer agents, platinum agents, taxanes,
procarbazine, asparaginase, and epipodophyllotoxins are thought to
increase the susceptibility to such reactions [23]. Previously
pharmacoepidemiological analyses were performed to confirm the
HSRs caused by these agents, using more than a million AERs
submitted to the FDA.[23] Carboplatin reported Hypersensitivity
reactions (rash, urticaria, erythema, pruritus, and rarely
bronchospasm and hypotension) in 2% of the patients [24]. The
clinical features of carboplatin-induced HSRs are highly variable and
difficult clinical management issue [25].

In this study, twenty eight reports of ototoxicity associated with
cisplatin and 122 reports of Pruritis associated with the carboplatin

were reported as per data received from CADRMP in 30 years
(01/01/1970–01/03/2010). Further, 17 reports of ototoxicity were
not associated with cisplatin whereas 381 reports of pruritis were
not associated with carboplatin.

For cisplatin, the values of PRR (53.44), ROR (55.03), PRR calculated
by chi-square statistics (544.70), 95% confidence interval of PRR
(3.67 & 4.57), O/E ratio (20.9130), PRR by Du-Mouchel Method
(20.7977) suggest toxic signal for ototoxicity. Further, the value of
IC-2SD value was 2.91 for cisplatin which also suggest middle
intensity for ototoxicity associated with cisplatin. For carboplatin,
the values of PRR (7.04), ROR (7.60), PRR calculated by chi-square
statistics (458.43), 95% confidence interval of PRR (1.93 & 1.97),
O/E ratio (16.43854), PRR by Du-Mouchel Method (16.4360)
suggest toxic signal for pruritis. Further, the value of IC-2SD value
was 2.19 for carboplatin which also suggest middle intensity for
pruritis associated with carboplatin.
Based on above analysis and available literature for cisplatininduced ototoxicity and carboplatin-induced pruritis. It is
recommended that treating physician should anticipate and counsel
the patient adequately prior to starting of therapy to minimize
above uncommon adverse effects.
