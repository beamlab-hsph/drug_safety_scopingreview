Abstract
Background and Objective With the rise in polypharmacy,
it is increasingly important to identify drug–drug interactions (DDIs) that cause serious adverse events in a timely
manner. The purpose of the study was to investigate the
utility of systematic data mining of the US Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) Adverse Event Reporting System
(FAERS) database for interactions between statins (HMGCoA reductase inhibitors) and other drugs that underlie a
higher risk for rhabdomyolysis.
Methods The strength of association for the reporting of
rhabdomyolysis with each statin–drug combination was
measured using Bayesian data mining scores, the Interaction Signal Score (INTSS), and simple proportions that
were calculated as the reporting odds ratio (ROR). Scores
[1.0 indicate disproportionately higher than expected

reporting. A manual case review highlighted strengths and
limitations of these measures.
Results As expected, clarithromycin and cyclosporine
produced high measures of disproportionate reporting of
rhabdomyolysis with lovastatin and simvastatin. Drugs
with no known predilection to contribute to statin myopathy produced scores \1.0 when paired with each statin. In
contrast, in some instances INTSS values were \1.0 when
measures of DDI with statin–drug pairs known to interact.
This might be due to masking by high numbers of reports
linked to the non-statin drug alone. The manual review
identified dose as an important risk factor; however, this
risk factor could not have been systematically identified
without informatics enhancements.
Conclusions While disproportionality methods represent a
promising tool for identifying a potential serious DDI,
opportunities remain for improvements in both data mining
algorithms and the acquisition of adequately informative
data.

Systematic data mining of large drug safety
databases, such as the US Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) Adverse Event Reporting
System (FAERS), has the potential to identify
potential ‘signals’ for emerging, clinically
problematic drug–drug interactions.
Our study highlights a need to comprehensively
enhance 3-dimensional data mining of the FAERS
database by facilitating automated access to and
processing of information that is embedded in each
report.

1 Introduction
Optimal management of novel adverse events (AEs) of
allopathic drug therapy includes the timely identification
and characterization of drug–drug interactions (DDIs) that
underlie toxicity, especially during a period in which there
has been a rising prevalence of polypharmacy [1–4].
Clinical trials performed prior to drug approval are not
intended to detect all possible clinically significant DDIs
that may occur in a large post-marketing treatment population in which concomitant exposures with many other
drugs are likely to occur. Moreover, many marketed drugs
have not been extensively studied in the elderly or in
patients with co-morbid illnesses, groups that are especially
vulnerable to serious DDIs [5]. Thus, post-marketing
surveillance must play an essential role in DDI detection
and assessment. For several decades, spontaneous reporting
systems have been the main source of post-marketing
safety information [6, 7]. Spontaneous reports of postmarketing AEs associated with drugs and therapeutic biologic products that have been submitted by domestic or
foreign pharmaceutical manufacturers, healthcare providers, and others to the US Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) are entered into the FDA Adverse Event Reporting
System (FAERS) database. Currently, this database contains over 12 million AE reports and receives over 1 million new reports annually. The rapidly expanding size of
FAERS and the complexity of the information contained in
the reports necessitate the development of new, automated
methods to reliably identify DDIs.
Systematic data mining (‘‘disproportionality analyses’’)
of large drug safety databases, such as FAERS, has the
potential to provide a screening mechanism for identification
of potential ‘signals’ for emerging, clinically problematic
DDIs that underlie serious AEs [8–11]. In order to investigate the utility of systematic screening of DDIs by different
data mining methods in the FAERS database, this study
analyzed a set of well-documented interactions between
3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA)
reductase inhibitors (‘statins’) known to cause serious muscle injury and rhabdomyolysis and a selected number of
concomitantly administered drugs that modify this risk.
Statin-induced rhabdomyolysis is a rare AE [12–14].
Importantly, the risk of this AE rises with increases in the
statin dose, a number of genetic polymorphisms and nongenetic susceptibility risk factors, and the concomitant use
of certain medications [15–18]. In an analysis of 35 randomized placebo-controlled trials of statins, 60 % of statinrelated rhabdomyolysis cases were attributable to DDIs
[19]. The importance of statin dosing and DDIs was
highlighted in an FDA drug safety communication
regarding simvastatin [20].

M. A. Muñoz et al.

Because each product has somewhat distinct pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties, certain statins
may be more likely to cause rhabdomyolysis secondary to
interactions with concomitant medications. Intracellular
reduction of prenylated proteins or other metabolites in the
HMG-CoA reductase biosynthetic pathway, or perturbations of mitochondrial functions in muscle cells have been
hypothesized to underlie statin-induced myopathy [21]. It
is not surprising that many concomitantly administered
drugs that are linked to an increased risk for statin-induced
rhabdomyolysis have been shown to reduce the uptake,
metabolism, and/or clearance of some or all statins by
hepatocytes through the inhibition of one or more organic
anion membrane transporters or cytochrome P450 (CYP)
isoenzyme activities [17, 22]. Simvastatin, lovastatin, and
to a lesser degree atorvastatin are metabolized by CYP3A4
and consequently have been associated with severe
idiosyncratic myopathic reactions in the presence of certain
CYP3A4 inhibitors. On the other hand, when combined
with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors, fluvastatin, pravastatin,
and rosuvastatin, statins that are not metabolized by
CYP3A4, would be less likely to interact and cause these
reactions [23–27]. Some co-administered drugs strongly
increase the risk of statin-induced rhabdomyolysis by
interacting with multiple proteins that regulate hepatocyte
disposal of statins. For example, gemfibrozil inhibits both
CYP2C8 and organic anion transporting polypeptide 1B1
(OATP1B1) and cyclosporine inhibits CYP3A4, P-glycoprotein, and OATP1B1.

2 Methods
The study was determined to be exempt from review by the
FDA’s Institutional Review Board. We utilized the FAERS
database to analyze disproportionality of reporting of
rhabdomyolysis associated with statins and a set of concomitantly administered drugs with varying potential to
increase the risk of this AE. In some analyses, FAERS
reports with three items or ‘dimensions’ that described coadministration of a specified statin and non-statin drug
combination with rhabdomyolysis as an outcome were
analyzed. Such analyses are referred to as ‘3-dimensional’
(3D) analyses. Reports included in the 3D analyses met the
following criteria: domestic reports (USA); AE included
the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities
(MedDRAÒ1) preferred term rhabdomyolysis; outcome
reported was a serious AE; and drugs were listed by the
MedDRAÒ terminology is the international medical terminology
developed under the auspices of the International Conference on
Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH).

reporter to MedWatch as either ‘suspect’ or ‘concomitant.’
Given substantial changes in the restrictions, contraindications, and dose limitations imposed on simvastatin in
2011, reports were limited to a date received by the FDA of
31 December 2010 [20, 28].
All US-marketed statins and statin-containing products
were included with the exception of cerivastatin (withdrawn from the market in 2001 due to reports of fatal
rhabdomyolysis) and pitavastatin (approved in August
2009). The non-statin drug products known to increase the
risk of rhabdomyolysis associated with some statins
included amiodarone, amlodipine, clarithromycin, cyclosporine, diltiazem, gemfibrozil, and ketoconazole. 3D
analyses with concomitantly used drugs that do not
increase the statin-associated risk of rhabdomyolysis,
including albuterol, ibuprofen, metoprolol, and sulfamethoxazole–trimethoprim, were employed as negative
controls.
The non-statin products associated with this increased
risk are well-established in the literature and are often
listed in the prescribing information of statins. Negative
controls were selected based on prescribing information,
the absence of known mechanisms associated with rhabdomyolysis, and lack of publications that point to such a
risk.
As a frame of reference, ‘2-dimensional’ (2D) analyses
of FAERS reports of rhabdomyolysis that listed one, not
both, drug from each of the statin/non-statin pairs that were
separately analyzed in the corresponding 3D analyses were
performed.
The strength of association in the reporting of rhabdomyolysis with each statin–drug combination was measured using both Bayesian data-mining scores (Interaction
Signal Score [INTSS]) and simple proportions that were
calculated as reporting odds ratios (RORs) [29, 30].
Bayesian analyses were conducted with Empirica SignalTM
software, which utilizes the Multi-item Gamma Poisson
Shrinker (MGPS) algorithm to produce Empirical Bayes
Geometric Mean (EBGM) scores of observed/expected
numbers of AE reports and their respective 90 % confidence intervals (CIs) (lower [EB05] and upper [EB95]
bound of the 90 % EBGM CI) [31, 32]. EBGMs with
accompanying EB05 and EB95 values were generated in
3D and corresponding 2D analyses. The EBGM incorporates Bayesian ‘shrinkage’ and stratification (sex, report
year, and age) to produce disproportionality scores toward
the null, especially when there are limited data and small
numbers of cases. The statistical modifications used in the
EBGM methodology reduce the number of false-positive
safety signals [8].
INTSS values generated from the 3D and 2D MGPS
analyses reflect the extent of non-overlap between the
lower CI of the 3D drug–drug–AE combination and the

329

highest drug–AE EB95 score (EB95MAX) among the
corresponding 2D single drug–AE pair. In the 2D measurement of the EBGM, the ‘expected’ frame of reference
is the measured rate of reporting of the interrogated AE in
the whole database. INTSS values were calculated as the
EB05 values of each 3D drug–drug–AE combination
divided by the EB95MAX among the pairs. By definition,
an INTSS score of B1.0 indicates no statistically significant interaction and is marked by partial or complete
overlap of the 90 % CIs of reports containing the drug–
drug–AE combination with CIs of reports listing corresponding single drug–AE pairs. As measured in the formula in Eq. (1), an INTSS score of [1.0 indicates nonoverlap of these CIs; the higher the score, the greater the
degree of non-overlap, indicating a potentially pronounced
DDI leading to the outcome of interest (in this case,
rhabdomyolysis).

reported), and d is reports of all other serious AEs with the
interrogated statin only (other drug not reported).
An ROR was considered higher than expected with
reference to the statin alone-associated AE levels if the
lower bound of the 95 % CI was [1.0.
2.1 Rhabdomyolysis Case Characteristics
To strengthen evaluation of the 3D analyses, all reports of
rhabdomyolysis associated with each statin and amiodarone, amlodipine, clarithromycin, cyclosporine, or diltiazem were manually reviewed. Duplicate reports, as well
as reports associated with cerivastatin, or causally linked
to an alternative etiology (e.g., trauma, exercise, etc.)
were removed. The temporal association between rhabdomyolysis and the administration of the statin and nonstatin drug was reviewed in the remaining reports. Drugs
were considered to be concomitantly administered if given
within 30 days of each other. An interaction between the
drug pair and AE was considered plausible if the concomitancy occurred within 30 days leading to the event
date or if there was specific mention in the report’s narrative of a close temporal association. The 30-day window

Clarithromycin, a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, produced
high measurements of disproportionate reporting of rhabdomyolysis (positive signals) with lovastatin (ROR: 11.7
[95 % CI 6.8–20.1], INTSS: 8.1) and simvastatin (ROR:
6.4 [95 % CI 4.9–8.4], INTSS: 4.6). Not surprisingly, the
EB05 scores of the corresponding drug–drug–AE combinations were all [30 (see Fig. 1). In the 3D drug combination with clarithromycin, the ROR was also above that
expected with atorvastatin (ROR: 3.2 [95 % CI 1.8–5.8]).
Cyclosporine showed significant interactions using both
methods with lovastatin (ROR: 15.3 [95 % CI 9.1–25.8],
INTSS: 7.1) and simvastatin (ROR: 9.6 [95 % CI
7.6–12.1], INTSS: 5.0). Additionally, the ROR for
cyclosporine was above that expected with atorvastatin
(ROR 2.0 [95 % CI 1.2–3.4]) and pravastatin (ROR: 2.5
[95 % CI 1.2–5.2]). There were no reported cases of
cyclosporine with fluvastatin resulting in rhabdomyolysis.
The EB05 of the gemfibrozil–rhabdomyolysis reports
(11.3), also shown in Table 2, was higher than any of the
2D statin–rhabdomyolysis pairs in Table 1. ROR values of
rhabdomyolysis associated with gemfibrozil and each
concomitantly administered statin were higher than
expected relative to statin-associated reports in the absence
of gemfibrozil. Consistent with this finding, the gemfibrozil-associated INTSS measures were also elevated
([1.0) with lovastatin, simvastatin, pravastatin, and fluvastatin. However, with atorvastatin the gemfibrozil-associated INTSS was only 0.5. In this instance, the EB05 of
rhabdomyolysis reports with the two-drug combination was
lower than the EB95 of the reports with gemfibrozil alone,
as graphically shown in Fig. 2. The gemfibrozil-associated
INTSS with rosuvastatin was 0.97. Even though this
measure was surprisingly \1.0 with the presence of overlapping CIs, the 3D EBGM of the statin–non-statin drug
combination was nonetheless higher than the 2D EBGMs
of rhabdomyolysis reports of rosuvastatin or gemfibrozil
not listing concomitant use of both drugs (see Fig. 2).
Not surprisingly, there were no drugs in the subset of
tested agents believed not to increase the risk of statininduced muscle injury that showed disproportionate
reporting when co-prescribed with statins, both by ROR
and INTSS measurements (ibuprofen [see Table 2; Fig. 3],
albuterol, metoprolol, or sulfamethoxazole–trimethoprim
[data not shown]).

spontaneous reporting system that often does not reliably
annotate exact dates of drug exposure. Information about
age, sex, race, weight, and statin dose was also collected
from each report.

3 Results
3.1 Measures of Reporting Odds Ratio Values
and Interaction Signal Scores
The number of FAERS reports of rhabdomyolysis associated with each statin, together with EBGM scores and CIs
are shown in Table 1. The EB05 values for all statins were
[2.0 for single drug–AE 2D analyses. Rosuvastatin was
associated with the highest EB05 value (6.65), while
atorvastatin was associated with the lowest (2.28). Of all
the statins analyzed, most reports of rhabdomyolysis submitted to FAERS prior to 2011 were associated with simvastatin (n = 2041; 49 %), while fluvastatin was
associated with the fewest (n = 63; 1.5 %).
Table 2 displays EBGM CIs from a 2D analysis of
rhabdomyolysis reports associated with the non-statin drug
and a 3D analysis of reports with two drugs (non-statin
drug co-prescribed with each statin) and their corresponding INTSS and ROR measures. In the 3D analyses of statins with amiodarone, a CYP3A4 inhibitor, there were no
drug pairs that produced an INTSS [1.0. In contrast, when
co-prescribed with amiodarone, simvastatin produced a
higher ROR than expected [1.6 (95 % CI 1.2–1.9)].
Amlodipine in combination with each of the statins produced INTSS values that were uniformly B1.0, while with
pravastatin the ROR was slightly higher than expected [1.6
(95 % CI 1.0–2.3)].

drug-event pairs, while little work has evaluated the
extension of these tools for detecting DDIs.
Our study results demonstrate that 3D data mining
analysis could be useful in detecting DDIs that increase the
risk of statin-induced rhabdomyolysis. However, a major
limitation in the interpretation of both INTSS scores and
ROR values is that they are predicated on calculations
generated from spontaneously submitted data. In the raw
FAERS datasets, scores linked to 2D analyses do not
necessarily reflect reports of rhabdomyolysis caused by
exposure to the individual drugs used alone. For example,
reports that were included in a computation of the EBGM
of the 2D simvastatin–rhabdomyolysis pair specifically
listed the statin on a MedWatch form as either ‘suspect’ or
‘concomitant.’ Unfortunately, without a pre-specified filtering step for their removal, these reports could also list
exposure to one or more other separately listed statin-interacting drug(s), such as gemfibrozil, that may have contributed to the AE.
A similar limitation due to the absence of a report filtering step became apparent in interpreting the EBGM of
the gemfibrozil–rhabdomyolysis pair. This computed
measurement was higher than the non-filtered 2D EBGMs
for each of the statin–rhabdomyolysis pairs (shown in
Table 1). It follows that without manual review of individual MedWatch reports and the removal of reports
marked by plausible interactions with other concomitantly

4 Discussion
With large numbers of MedWatch reports submitted each
day to FAERS, data mining offers a systematic approach to
identify potential safety signals in a timely fashion. In 2007
the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) was
amended to require regular, bi-weekly screening of FAERS
to identify potential safety signals and publication of these
signals quarterly on the FAERS website [33]. A review of
the FDA web postings from 2008 through 2010 determined
that 74 (48 %) of the 153 postings resulted in a label
change, three (4 %) of which were alterations to the drug
interaction section of the label [34]. A large body of studies
evaluating the usefulness of data mining analyses in
FAERS has focused on the disproportional reporting of

used statins or drugs that can increase risk for muscle
injury, it is misleading to conclude that gemfibrozil
monotherapy is associated with a robust signal for rhabdomyolysis that is strikingly higher than atorvastatin or
rosuvastatin used concomitantly with gemfibrozil. The

number of reports included in the 2D analysis of gemfibrozil-associated rhabdomyolysis was 2105, among which
1544 (73 %) were reports that also listed exposure to
cerivastatin and 655 were associated with other statins.
Subtracting tallies of reports associated with each of the

Data Mining Drug–Drug Interactions in FAERS

statins resulted in a negative number (-95) due to the
listing of multiple statins in some cases. Unfortunately, in
the current FAERS database there is no reliable automatic
method to filter out all reports in which a statin was concomitantly used from the gemfibrozil–rhabdomyolysis
reports prior to computing measures of disproportionality.
In this case, it is evident that a corrected EBGM of the
gemfibrozil–rhabdomyolysis 2D analysis without statin coprescription would be substantially lower. Inflated EBGM
scores and CIs used in the INTSS calculations of 2D
measures that should reflect single drug–rhabdomyolysis
associations could result in masking when measuring
whether atorvastatin or rosuvastatin interact with gemfibrozil with 3D analyses. Likewise, the 3D analyses might
include reports marked by concomitant exposure to a
number of additional risk-modifying drugs in conjunction
with the specific statin–drug combinations being evaluated.
These should also be identified and characterized in a risk
analysis.
Unlike the procedure currently used to measure INTSS,
ROR analysis can separate reports into distinct groups,
each defined by exposure to other statins and non-interactive non-statin drugs. Although these two measures of
disproportionality were often consistent with one another
as indicators of when thresholds of disproportionate
reporting were exceeded, in some instances ROR measurements of rhabdomyolysis–drug combinations were
[1.0 when the corresponding INTSS scores were not
elevated. In contrast, there were no examples in which
computations of INTSS scores were elevated in the presence of non-elevated ROR values. This finding suggests
that, overall, the ROR is a more sensitive measure of disproportionate reporting of rhabdomyolysis associated with
drug–statin interactions than the INTSS, as currently
measured. Among additional signals that were indicated by
ROR values[1.0, several are thought to indicate true DDIs
that cause rhabdomyolysis. These include ROR measures
that were linked to the combined prescriptions of amiodarone–simvastatin, gemfibrozil–atorvastatin, gemfibrozil–
rosuvastatin, cyclosporine–atorvastatin, and cyclosporine–
pravastatin. Although the amlodipine–pravastatin drug
combination also showed disproportionate reporting by
ROR measurement, whether this signal represents a true
DDI is unknown.
Establishing measures of sensitivity and specificity for
INTSS and ROR is problematic, as there is no gold standard or complete listing of combinations of drugs that
cause clinically significant drug interactions. Listed interactions in FDA-approved product labels can be useful as a
reference, but in some cases these are determined by circumstantial or indirect factors such as known effects linked
to other members of a drug class. In addition, product
labeling would not list interactions that have yet to be

335

identified. Other shortcomings of data mining analyses are
largely related to the inherent limitations of a passive
reporting system, which include incomplete and changing
secular trends in spontaneous reporting that can be influenced by publicity and litigation [35]. FAERS reports are
also subject to confounding by medical conditions and
exposure to other drugs that may underlie the AE. In
addition, variability in data completeness and quality in
FAERS reports is a limiting factor to being able to reliably
account for potential confounders. This is particularly
problematic, given the prevalence of missing information
such as dose, sex, and age of patients in FAERS reports. In
these reports a listing of other relevant concomitant medications may often have been omitted. Concomitant medications may not be included in FAERS reports, especially
if they are not recognized among healthcare providers as
contributing to the reported AE. Taking these limitations
into account, measurements of disproportionality of
reporting in FAERS do not reflect quantitative levels of
risk or definitively disprove an increased risk for a particular AE. Such measurements should be primarily used to
generate hypotheses surrounding strengths of associations
between specified drug combinations and these events.
These must then be confirmed or refuted, using other
methods and datasets.
There are differences among the statins in terms of their
propensity to cause rhabdomyolysis. Although statins
associated with a lower risk for this adverse drug reaction,
such as fluvastatin or pravastatin, are less potent in terms of
low-density lipoprotein (LDL) reduction, the risk of
myopathy is not directly correlated with potency [36]. The
FDA’s review of data from large clinical trials of high
doses of statins indicates that the incidence of myopathy
was approximately three times higher with the 80 mg dose
of simvastatin than with superior LDL-lowering doses of
rosuvastatin and atorvastatin [37]. Statin exposure based on
daily dosing as a risk factor was apparent when the reports
of rhabdomyolysis were manually characterized by dose
and further highlighted in context of domestic statin utilization data. Although the highest dosing strength of
simvastatin (80 mg) is less often prescribed than lower
dosing strengths, it was associated with the largest numbers
of reports [28, 38]. Evaluating concurrent drug utilization
data also allows for a crude assessment of the relevance
and potential impact of DDIs. Although lack of a disproportionate reporting signal for an AE in FAERS may be a
result of absence of increased risk with combined use of
two medications, an alternative explanation may be infrequent concomitant use of the combination.
Our study highlights a need to comprehensively enhance
3D data mining of the FAERS database by facilitating
automated access to and processing of information that is
embedded in each report. To achieve efficient and

336

systematic analyses of appropriately stratified report data, a
future generation of programming technology must incorporate significant improvements in the cataloging and
retrieval of key pertinent data as well as demonstrate
increased flexibility in analytic functions for assessing
DDIs. A full extraction of the demographic characteristics,
clinical features, drug exposure, and dosing information
present in each FAERS report, including the free-text
narrative, would improve analyses of the determinants and
modifiers of drug-related AE signals. With such a system in
place, measurements of disproportionality would be
equipped to filter duplicate reports as well as remove or
separate reports with concomitant drug exposures different
from those that are under evaluation but are also known to
increase the risk of the AE of concern. As demonstrated by
the results of our study, the systematized filtering of such
reports in FAERS is necessary in order to avoid masking
some clinically significant DDIs. Automated functions to
achieve these goals would replace the current requirement
for time-consuming manual inspection of multitudes of
FAERS reports.

5 Conclusion
While disproportionality methods represent a promising
tool for identifying a potential serious DDI, there remain
opportunities for improvements in both data mining algorithms and the acquisition of adequately informative data.
The automated consolidation of drug safety information
from other data streams such as clinical trials and epidemiological studies as well as pre-clinical and pharmacological studies will enable regulatory scientists to
evaluate the totality of evidence associated with a potential
treatment-related risk of concern. Advances in informatic
tools available for this purpose must coincide with the
development of biosystem algorithms to integrate and
interpret toxicological, biochemical and clinical AE data
[39, 40].
