ly associated with an increased risk of hepatotoxicity based
on the outcomemeasureof the reporting odds ratio (ROR).
The ROR, along with 3 other methods, including the proportional reporting ratio (PRR), the information component (IC), and the Gamma Poisson Shrinker (GPS), are
known as data mining algorithms (DMAs).1O·15 They are
computer-assisted signal detection techniques of adverse
drug reactions (ADRs), characterized by providing a fast
and cost-efficient way of detecting possibleADR signals,"
However, the only previously published study of these
techniques has been associated with several methodological limitations," First,the FDA's AdverseEventsReporting
System (AERS) data are collected and updated on a quarterly basis, which enables the DMAs to update and improve the estimations of the signal in light of more data.
However, Dore et al. did not start collecting data until 8
months after the approval of telithromycin and, more importantly, only 6 months of data were examined (ie, January-June 2(05). Therefore, the findings failed to provide
any information with respect to the status of the signal followingthe approval and the changes of the signalover time,
whichis essential to determine the timing of the signal being
detected. Second, only the ROR algorithm was applied to
detect the signal in the aforementioned study. In contrast
with the ROR, the IC and the GPS, with incorporation of
Bayesian methods, are believed to add stability to the estimates,especially for eventsof low frequency. Since none of
the 4 DMAs is considered as a gold standardfor signal detection, it is critical to examineand validate the signal across
the 4 methods to determine the robustness of the findings.
With these considerations in mind, we believed that it
would be of great interest to reanalyze the FDA AERS
data on a quarterly basis and apply the 4 DMAs to detect
whether a safety signal exists that suggests an association
between reports of hepatotoxicity and the use of telithromycin. In addition to quantifying the safety signal, the
robustness and the timing of signal detection were deter·minedby comparingthe findings across the 4 DMAs over
time.This study will help us gain a better understanding of
the signal of hepatotoxicity associated with telithromycin,
as well as the potentials of these techniques for active
pharmacovigilance.

Methods
DATABASE

ADR signal detections were performed based upon the
AERS, which has been collecting nationwide spontaneous
ADR reports sincethe 1970s and hasrecently become one of
the primary data sources for identification of drug safety signals.The AERS contains34.5 yearsof data, including over
25 millionreports acrossall marketed drugs and biological
products, and increases in size yearly by 300,000 reports!' It

consists of 4 major sections including demographics, medications,adverseevents, and therapies. Each section is connected by a primary link field witha unique 7-digitnumber.
The period of the AERS in this study is from the first
quarter of 2004, when telithromycin was approved in the
US, to the second quarterof 2006.
IDENTIFICATION OF HEPATOTOXICITY ANDTHE USEOF
TELITHROMYCIN

Since November 1997, all events in the AERS have
been coded for data entry in accordance with the standardizedterminology, knownas Preferred Terms,in the Medical
Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA).ts The hierarchical classification of MedORA is organizedby System
Organ Class (total 26), which consists of high-levelgroup
terms (334), high-level terms (1682), preferred terms
(16,976),and lower-level terms (62,950).In this study,the
preferred terms indexed in the MedORA(version 9.1) were
searchedfor the identification of adverseevents associated
withhepatotoxicity, which included jaundice, hepatitis, hepatotoxicity, hepatic failure, hepatic necrosis, coma hepatic, and
acutehepatic failure. Sincethereis no consistent codingsystem for drug products in the AERS,15 both the brand name
(Ketek) and the generic name (telithromycin) were used to
identify the number of reports withthe useof telithromycin.
COMPUTATIONS OF DMAS

Once the reporting of hepatotoxicity and the use of
telithromycin were identified, multiple 2 x 2 contingency
tables from the first quarter of 2004 to the second quarter
of 2006 on a quarterly basis were generated. The DMAs
detect drug-event combinations (DECs) with a frequency
that is disproportionately higher comparedwith baselineor
the generality of the database. In the 2 x 2 table, the frequencies of telithromycin and hepatotoxicity combinations
(represented by A) were compared with any other reports
in the AERS including the number with descriptions of
hepatotoxicity and with the use of any drugs except
telithromycin (B), the number of reports with the use of
telithromycin and with description of any events except
hepatotoxicity (C), and the number of reports with the use
of any drugs except telithromycin and the reportingof any
eventsexcept hepatotoxicity (0).
The computations of the 4 DMAs are demonstrated in
Table 1. The ROR is similar to the concept of odds ratio,
calculating the odds of exposure of the suspected drug in
patients who had events divided by the odds of exposure
of the suspected drug in those without events." The ROR
- 1.96SE (standarderror) greater than 1 is oftenused as a
signaling criterion," Computation of the PRR is the same
as computation of the relative risk estimated in a cohort
study in epidemiology. The proposed criteria of the PRR

among 490 reports on the use of telithromycin recorded in
the AERS due to whatever adverse events, 91 (18.6%) were
related to hepatotoxicity (Table 2).
The estimations of the PRR with the X2 value, the ROR
- 1.96SE, the IC - 2SD, and the EB05 of the GPS are
demonstrated in Table 3. Based on the signaling thresholds
listed in Table 1, the safety signal was detected in the first
quarter of 2005 by the ROR and the IC, indicating that the
use of telithromycin may be associated with an increased risk
of hepatotoxicity. The signal was flagged by the PRR and the
GPS in the second and fourth quarters of 2005, respectively.

Bayesian methods are used to cope with the variability of
the estimation of relative rate (RR), which is defined as the
ratio of the observed number of cases to the expected number of cases. The improved estimation of RR, known as
the geometric mean of empirical Bayesian (EBGM), and
the lower confidence interval (CI), known as EB05, are
calculated using the methods described by DuMouchelP
In our study, the 4 DMAs were estimated and updated
on a quarterly basis. The signal thresholds used to indicate
the presence of a safety signal included ROR - 1.96SE > 1
for the ROR, PRR ~ 2 with X2 ~ 4, and the presence of at
least 3 case reports for the PRR, EB05 ~ 2 for the GPS,
and IC - 2SD > 0 for the IC. The computations were performed using SAS version 9.0 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).

Discussion
In this study, a safety signal was consistently indicated
across the 4 DMAs based on the AERS data, suggesting
that the use of telithromycin might be associated with an
increased risk of hepatotoxicity compared with the use of
any other agents in the AERS. These findings were consistent with current beliefs and previous observations. In the
Dore et a1.9 study, an 82% increased risk of hepatotoxicity
was identified in users of telithromycin based on the spontaneous data collected from the first half-year of 2005. In
our study, 2-year data immediately following the approval
of the drug were analyzed. With the increased number of
reports, the low limit of CI of the ROR significantly increased, from zero in the first quarter of 2004 to 4.97 by
the second quarter of 2006. Based on the signal threshold
of the ROR, a telithromycin-related hepatotoxicity signal
was detected in the first quarter of 2005, which is almost
within the same timeframe as when the first death was reported to the FDA. Compared with Dore et al.'s findings,

ReSUlts
From 2004 to 2006 a total of 226 case reports describing hepatotoxicity and the use of telithromycin were collected in the AERS. Among the 198 cases with sex reported,
70 (31.0%) were female. Age of the patient was reported in
128 cases: 21 (9.3%) were 16-30 years old, 28 (12.3%)
were 31-45 years old, 48 (21.2%) were 46-60 years old, 25
(11.0%) were 61-75 years old, and 5 (2.2%) were older than
75 years. No telithromycin-related hepatotoxicity case was
reported in the AERS in the first quarter of 2004. The first
Case was reported and the number started to increase coincidentally with increased use of the drug following its intro-

we identified only a 62% increased risk by the second
quarter of 2005. The observed 20% difference might be
due to the difference in the selection of control populations. In the study by Dore et al., some control diagnoses,
which were believed to be independent of the use of
telithromycin, were selected as background for comparison, while our study selected any other reported adverse
events in the AERS except hepatotoxicity. In addition,
similar trends were found for the PRR, IC, and GPS. By
the second quarter of 2006, the value of the PRR was 5.32
with a total of 226 cases, indicating that the reporting of
hepatotoxicity among patients using telithromycin was
over 5 times the number of reports of hepatotoxicity
among those taking any other drugs.

Although the signal was detected by all 4 DMAs, the
timing of signal detection was slightly different. The signal
was first detected by the ROR and the IC in the first quarter of 2005, then by the PRR in the second quarter of 2005,
and finally by the GPS in the fourth quarter of 2005. Many
factors could have contributed to the observed differences,
such as the selection of signaling thresholds or the profiles
of suspected DECs. To the best of our knowledge, no previous studies have been published that directly compare
these 4 algorithms in terms of the timing of signal detection. In our study, it seemed that the ROR and IC might
have performed better in terms of timing of signal detection compared with the PRR and GPS. Further studies are
indeed warranted, given that the timing of signal detection

respect to the concepts,underlying statistical models,procedures of computations, and application and interpretation of
reSUlts, as well as their strengths and limitations.IO•15,20.24
Overall, estimations of the IC and the GPS are oftenbelieved
to providemore stable estimationsof risk than do the ROR
andthe PRR,especially whendealing withDECs with small
frequency, but the estimationsrequirecertain mathematical
knowledge and complicatedcalculations. In contrast to the
Ie and GPS, the PRR and ROR are relatively easy to understand and the involved computations are far lessintensive.
The findings of our study should be considered within
the context of its limitations. First, our findings may have
been affected by bias and confounding. Due to the nature
of the spontaneous reporting system,underreporting occurs
frequently within the AERS. In addition, the reporting of adverseevents and the use of drugs derived from the spontaneousreportingsystem are often affectedby reportingbias.
Anydisclosure of drug safetyinformation may causehealthcare providers and consumers to becomemorevigilant of potential adverse effects, leadingto overreporting of associated
dmgsand events. In a recentstudy, Pariente et al.25 foundthat
the disproportionality in the spontaneousreporting system
significantly increasedfollowing a safety alert. This signal
variation mightnot be due to a modification in the riskof occurrence of events, which remains unchanged after safety
alerts,but rather to the changes in behavior of recognition
and reporting of events.Given the consideration that the labeling oftelithromycinwas revisedon June 29, 2006,to add
the contraindication, we analyzed only data reportedpriorto
June2006to control for the reporting bias.Second,the signal
of hepatotoxicity associated with the use of telithromycin
couldbe affected by unmeasuredconfounding factors,such
as concomitant use of alcohol or other drugs that may cause
increased riskof liver injury, Thoseconfounding factors were
not able to be controlled for by DMAs, since they are un~11Sed

available in the AERS. Therefore, the findings of DMAs
shouldbe appropriately incorporated with clinical judgment
and product/therapeutic knowledge and interpreted with caution. Finally,although great efforts have been made by the
FDA to improve the coding system, there is no consistent
and standardized codingsystemfor the medications reported
in the AERS.15

Conclusions
As shown by our consistentfindings across the 4 DMAs
evaluated here, a safety signal might be indicated linking
the use of telithromycin with an increased risk of hepatotoxicity. Given the wide use of telithromycin and serious
consequences of hepatotoxicity, clinicians should be more
cautious when selecting this drug for the treatment of infection, althoughfurther observational studies are required
to evaluate the signal and its relationship to hepatotoxicity.
The 4 DMAs may also prove to be useful for the early detection of other serious and potentially life-threatening
drug-induced adverse events, as a complementary activity
to other traditional signal detectionapproaches.
