Abstract
Purpose: Some studies have suggested that the use of benzodiazepines in the elderly is associated
with an increased risk of dementia. However, this association might be due to confounding by
indication and reverse causation. To examine the association between benzodiazepine anxiolytic
drug use and the risk of dementia, we conducted data mining of a spontaneous reporting database
and a large organized database of prescriptions.
Methods: Data from the US Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System
(FAERS) from the first quarter of 2004 through the end of 2013 and data from the Canada Vigilance
Adverse Reaction Online Database from the first quarter of 1965 through the end of 2013 were
used for the analyses. The reporting odds ratio (ROR) and information component (IC) were
calculated. In addition, prescription sequence symmetry analysis (PSSA) was performed to identify
the risk of dementia after using benzodiazepine anxiolytic drugs over the period of January 2006 to
May 2014.
Results: Benzodiazepine use was found to be associated with dementia in analyses using the FAERS
database (ROR: 1.63, 95% CI: 1.61-1.64; IC: 0.66, 95% CI: 0.65-0.67) and the Canada Vigilance
Adverse Reaction Online Database (ROR: 1.88, 95% CI: 1.83-1.94; IC: 0.85, 95% CI: 0.80-0.89).
ROR and IC values increased with the duration of action of benzodiazepines. In the PSSA, a
significant association was found, with adjusted sequence ratios of 1.24 (1.05–1.45), 1.20
(1.06–1.37), 1.23 (1.11–1.37), 1.34 (1.23–1.47), 1.41 (1.29–1.53), and 1.44 (1.33–1.56) at intervals
of 3, 6, 12, 24, 36, and 48 months, respectively. Furthermore, the additional PSSA, in which patients
who initiated a new treatment with benzodiazepines and anti-dementia drugs within 12- and
24-month periods were excluded from the analysis, demonstrated significant associations of
benzodiazepine use with dementia risk.
Conclusion: Multi-methodological approaches using different methods, algorithms, and databases
suggest that long-term use of benzodiazepines and long-acting benzodiazepines are strongly
associated with an increased risk of dementia.

Introduction
An increase in the prevalence of dementia has
become a serious social problem due to an aging
society. Dementia is currently the main cause of
dependency in older individuals and a major public
health concern affecting approximately 36 million
people worldwide. The prevalence of dementia
rapidly increases from approximately 2-3% among

individuals aged 70-75 years to 20-25% among those
aged 85 years or more [1], and the number affected by
dementia is expected to double between 2020 and
2040 [2].
Anxiolytics are frequently used for the treatment
of mood or anxiety disorders and depression in the
elderly in many countries, and benzodiazepines are

Int. J. Med. Sci. 2016, Vol. 13
commonly prescribed for this purpose [3, 4].
However, it is inconclusive as to whether their
long-term use is effective and safe. Among the elderly,
user prevalence as high as 25% has been reported [5].
Recently, some studies suggested that the use of
benzodiazepines in the elderly is associated with an
increased risk of incident cognitive decline or
dementia [6-9]. Zhong et al. reported in a
meta-analysis of nested case-control or prospective
cohort studies that long-term benzodiazepine users
have an increased risk of dementia compared with
never users [10]. Billioti de Gage et al. systematically
reviewed published observational studies assessing
the relationship between benzodiazepine use and
dementia and concluded that exposure to
benzodiazepines was associated with a 1.5- to 2-fold
increased risk of dementia [11].
On the other hand, some studies suggested that
the observed association between benzodiazepine use
and dementia might be due to confounding by
indication and reverse causation. Certainly, anxiety
can be a prodromal symptom of dementia and is the
main indication for prescribing benzodiazepines [12].
Therefore, this association might be considered an
early marker of a condition associated with an
increased risk of dementia rather than a cause of the
dementia itself. Overall, the possibility of an increased
risk of dementia is still a matter of debate.
Recently, data mining of medical databases
including spontaneous adverse drug reaction
databases, claims databases, and prescription
databases was reported [13, 14]. Some different
methodologies and algorithms have been applied to
identify safety signals within these medical databases.
The aim of this study was to examine the association
between benzodiazepine use and dementia using
different methodologies, algorithms, and databases.

Methods
Spontaneous adverse drug reaction databases
Data sources
The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) and the
Canada Vigilance Adverse Reaction Online Database
are computerized information databases designed to
support post-marketing safety surveillance programs
for all approved drugs and therapeutic biological
products. The FAERS contains all reports of adverse
events reported spontaneously by health care
professionals,
manufacturers,
and
consumers
worldwide. The Canada Vigilance Adverse Reaction
Online Database contains all domestic reports of
adverse events reported spontaneously by health care
professionals, manufacturers, and consumers. The

826
FAERS consists of seven datasets that include patient
demographic and administrative information (file
descriptor DEMO), drug and biologic information
(DRUG), adverse events (REAC), patient outcomes
(OUTC), report sources (RPSR), start and end dates of
drug therapy (THER), and indications for
use/diagnosis (INDI). A unique number for
identifying a FAERS report allows all of the
information from different files to be linked. Raw data
from the FAERS database can be downloaded freely
from the FDA website (http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/
InformationOnDrugs/ucm135151.htm). Data from
the first quarter of 2004 through the end of 2013 were
included in this study. A total of 4,866,160 reports
were obtained. Reports with a common CASE number
were identified as duplicate reports, which we
excluded from the analyses. Finally, a total of
65,146,507 drug-reaction pairs were identified from
4,081,582 reports.
The Canada Vigilance Adverse Reaction Online
Database consists of 11 data files that include
information on reports and patients (Reports.txt),
drug names and their codes (Drug_Product.txt), the
active ingredients associated with all drugs
(Drug_Product_Ingredients.txt), the reaction terms
associated with the report (Reactions.txt), outcome
presentation text associated with the outcome code
(Outcome_LX.txt),
gender

text
associated with the gender code (Gender_LX.txt),
report type presentation text associated with the
report type code (Report_Type_LX.txt), report
seriousness presentation text associated with the
report seriousness code (Seriousness_LX.txt), report
source presentation text associated with the report
source code (Source_LX.txt), linked/duplicate reports
presentation text associated with the code
(Report_Links_LX.txt), drugs associated with specific
reports (Report_Drug.txt), and indications associated
with specific reports (Report_Drug_Indication.txt).
Raw data from the Canada Vigilance Adverse
Reaction Online Database can be downloaded freely
from
the
Health
Canada
website
(http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/dhp-mps/medeff/databas

1965 through the end of 2013 were included in this
study. A total of 4,019,652 drug-reaction pairs were
identified from 381,822 reports.

code of N05C were defined as benzodiazepine
anxiolytic drugs in this study (Table 1). A drug name
archive that included the names of all preparations,
generic names, and drug synonyms marketed
worldwide was created using the Martindale website
(https://www.medicinescomplete.com/mc/login.ht
m). Benzodiazepine anxiolytic drugs were identified
by linking this archive with the FAERS database and
the Canada Vigilance Adverse Reaction Online
Database (Table 1). All records including
benzodiazepine anxiolytic drugs were selected, and
the relevant reactions were then identified.

one another in that the ROR is frequentist
(non-Bayesian), whereas the IC is Bayesian. For the
ROR, a signal is detected if the lower limit of the 95%
two-sided confidence interval (95% CI) is >1 [15]. For
the IC, a signal is detected if the IC025 metric, the
lower limit of the 95% CI of the IC, is > 0 [16]. In the
current study, these two methods were used for signal
detection, and the adverse events were considered to
be drug-associated if the two indices met the criteria
indicated above. Data management and analyses were
performed using Visual Mining Studio software
(version 8.1; Mathematical Systems, Inc. Tokyo,
Japan).

Definition of adverse events
Adverse events in the FAERS and the Canada
Vigilance Adverse Reaction Online Database were
coded using the MedDRA® PTs, which are
categorized by defined medical condition or area of
interest. Using the Standardized MedDRA® Queries,
we identified 82 PTs in the category of dementia.

Statistical analysis
The reporting odds ratio (ROR) [15] and the
information component (IC) [16] were used to detect
spontaneous report signals. These signal scores were
calculated using a case/non-case method [17, 18].
Cases are the reports involving the event of interest
(i.e., dementia) and the non-cases all other reports.
ROR and IC are widely used and employed by the
Netherlands Pharmacovigilance Centre and the
World Health Organization, respectively [15, 16]. All
of these algorithms were used to calculate signal
scores to assess whether a drug was significantly
associated with an adverse event or not from a
two-by-two frequency table of counts. However, these
calculations
or
algorithms,
so-called
disproportionality analyses or measures, differ from

Data source
A large organized database of prescriptions
constructed by a database vendor (Japan Medical
Information Research Institute, Inc. Japan [JMIRI])
was used in the study. The JMIRI prescription
database consists of prescriptions collected from
approximately 700 pharmacies in Japan. The database
includes approximately 92,700,000 prescriptions for
approximately 10,300,000 patients from January 2006
to May 2014. For the PSSA, we identified cases
extracted
from
this
database
for
whom
benzodiazepine anxiolytic drugs (Table 1) and
anti-dementia drugs (donepezil, galantamine,
rivastigmine, and memantine) were prescribed at
least once during the study period. The data included
encrypted personal identifiers: month/year of birth
and gender of the patient, drug name, unique drug
code and generic name, and prescribing date. Data on
drugs dispensed in hospitals were not included. This
study was approved by the Ethics Committee of
Kindai University School of Pharmacy.

Study design
The PSSA was performed to test the hypothesis
that benzodiazepines increase the risk of dementia.
The PSSA method has been described in detail in
several published studies investigating the
associations between the use of certain target drugs
and potential adverse events [19, 20]. Briefly, the
PSSA evaluates asymmetry in the distribution of an
incident event (e.g., prescription of another drug)
before and after the initiation of a specific treatment.
Asymmetry may indicate an association between the
specific treatment of interest and the event. PSSA is
based on a situation in which drug A is suspected of
causing an adverse event that itself is treated by drug
B [19]. In this study, anti-dementia drugs were used as
markers of dementia caused by benzodiazepines, and

http://www.medsci.org

Int. J. Med. Sci. 2016, Vol. 13
the association between benzodiazepines and
anti-dementia drug uses was analyzed.
The ratio of the numbers of patients with a
prescription for anti-dementia drugs after versus
before the initiation of benzodiazepines was defined
as the crude sequence ratio (SR). A SR > 1 indicated an
increased risk of benzodiazepine-induced dementia.
The SR is sensitive to prescribing trends over time.
Therefore, the SRs were adjusted for temporal trends
in benzodiazepines and anti-dementia drugs using
the method proposed by Halls [19]. The probability
that benzodiazepines were prescribed first, in the
absence of any causal relationship, can be estimated
by the so-called null-effect SR [19]. The null-effect SR
yielded by the proposed model may be interpreted as
a reference value for the SR. Therefore, the null-effect
SR is the expected SR in the absence of any causal
association, after taking the incidence trends into
account. By dividing the crude SR by the null-effect
SR, an adjusted SR (ASR) corrected for temporal
trends is obtained. A slightly modified model was
used to account for the limited time interval allowed
between the benzodiazepine prescription and
treatment of dementia [20]. The major advantage of
the SR is that it is robust for confounders that are
stable over time. Significant confounding factors
including age, gender, and frequency of visits did not
cause
an
asymmetrical
distribution
of
benzodiazepines and anti-dementia drugs [20].

Data analysis
PSSA was undertaken to identify the new use of
anti-dementia drugs, which served as a marker of
benzodiazepine-induced dementia. All incident users
of benzodiazepines and anti-dementia drugs were
identified from January 2006 to May 2014. In this
study, patients included in the database were
followed up until May 2014, and therefore different
patients had different follow-up periods. Incidence
was defined as the first prescription of target drugs.
To exclude prevalent users of target drugs, the
analysis was restricted to users who presented their
first prescription on July 2006 or later, that is, after a
run-in period of 6 months. To ensure that our analysis
was restricted to incident users, we also performed a
waiting time distribution analysis [21]. An identical
run-in period was also applied to patients enrolled in
the cohort after July 2006 to exclude prevalent users of
the target drugs. The analysis was based on the
principle that by observing the first occurrence of a
prescription within a specific time window, prevalent
users of the drug will cluster at the beginning of the
observation period when the prescription is repeated
within a short time period. In contrast, incident users
will be distributed evenly throughout the observation

828
period. Incident users were identified by excluding
those patients who had received their first
prescription for the target drugs prior to June 2006.
All patients were identified who initiated new
treatments
with
both
benzodiazepines and
anti-dementia drugs within 3-, 6-, 12-, 24-, 36- and
48-month periods. Patients who had received their
first prescriptions for benzodiazepines and
anti-dementia drugs on the same date were not
included in the determination of the SR.
Results are expressed as the means ± standard
deviation (SD) for quantitative data and as
frequencies (percentage) for categorical data. The 95%
CIs for the ASRs were calculated using a method for
exact CIs for binomial distributions [22].

Additional analysis
The additional PSSA was performed in order to
address the problem about confounding by indication
and reverse causation bias. If indication and reverse
causation bias is responsible for the association
between benzodiazepine use and dementia, the
association for recent users should be stronger than
that for past users [23]. Therefore, patients who
initiated a new treatment with benzodiazepines and
anti-dementia drugs within 12- and 24-month periods
were excluded from the analysis to minimize the
effect of this confounding.

Results
FAERS database analyses
A total of 1,971,750 drug-reaction pairs for
dementia were found in the FAERS database. The
statistical results from the FAERS database analyses
are presented in Table 2. The signal scores suggested
that benzodiazepines were associated with dementia
(ROR: 1.63, 95% CI: 1.61-1.64; IC: 0.66, 95% CI:
0.65-0.67). In addition, classes of short-, medium-,
long-, and ultra-long-acting benzodiazepines were
also associated with dementia. The ROR and IC
values increased with the duration of benzodiazepine
action (Figure 1A). In the analyses of individual
benzodiazepines, significant associations with
dementia were found for etizolam, clotiazepam,
lorazepam, alprazolam, bromazepam, diazepam,
cloxazolam,
chlordiazepoxide,
medazepam,
clorazepate, loflazepate, oxazolam, and prazepam.

Canada Vigilance Adverse Reaction Online
Database
A total of 141,451 drug-reaction pairs for
dementia were found in the Canada Vigilance
Adverse Reaction Online Database. The statistical
results from the analyses using this database are
presented in Table 3. The signal scores suggested that
http://www.medsci.org

Int. J. Med. Sci. 2016, Vol. 13
a class of benzodiazepines is associated with dementia
(ROR: 1.88, 95% CI: 1.83-1.94; IC: 0.85, 95% CI:
0.80-0.89). In addition, medium- and long-acting
benzodiazepines were also associated with dementia.
The ROR and IC values of long-acting
benzodiazepines were higher than those of
medium-acting benzodiazepines (Figure 1B). In the
analyses of individual benzodiazepines, significant
associations with dementia were found for
lorazepam, bromazepam, diazepam, chlordiazepoxide, and clorazepate.

PSSA
The characteristics of the study population of the
PSSA are summarized in Table 4. The number of
prescriptions including those for benzodiazepines
during the study period was 9,332,070. Of the 577,099
benzodiazepine users, 145,496 incident users were
identified. The mean age of the incident users was
59.5 ± 18.7 years.

The associations between benzodiazepine and
anti-dementia drug use are shown in Table 5. Of the
145,496 incident users of benzodiazepines, 3,384 were
also identified as incident users of anti-dementia
drugs, before or after the initiation of the
benzodiazepines. A significant association between
benzodiazepine and anti-dementia drug use was
found, with ASRs of 1.24 (1.05-1.45), 1.20 (1.06-1.37),
1.23 (1.11-1.37), 1.34 (1.23-1.47), 1.41 (1.29-1.53), and
1.44 (1.33-1.56) at intervals of 3, 6, 12, 24, 36, and 48
months, respectively. Interval-related change in the
ASRs of benzodiazepines and individual classes of
benzodiazepines are presented in Figure 2. The ASRs
of benzodiazepines increased with the interval
duration. The ASRs of long- and ultra-long-acting
benzodiazepines were higher than those of short- and
medium-acting benzodiazepines for the relatively
short intervals. However, at the 48-month interval,
remarkable differences were not observed among the
individual classes of benzodiazepines, and all classes
were associated with dementia.
A
significant
association
between
benzodiazepine and anti-dementia drug use was also
found in the additional PSSA (Table 6A, Table 6B).
Exclusion of the patients who initiated a new
treatment with benzodiazepines and anti-dementia
drugs within 12- and 24-month periods did not affect
the risk of dementia induced by benzodiazepines.
A summary of the signals detected for
benzodiazepine-associated dementia is presented in

Discussion
This study suggested that benzodiazepine
anxiolytic drug use is associated with the
development of dementia. In the analyses of short-,
medium-,
long-,
and
ultra-long-acting
benzodiazepines, all classes of benzodiazepines are
associated with an increased risk of dementia. In the
analysis of the FAERS database, the ROR and IC
values increased with the duration of benzodiazepine
action. In the Canada Vigilance Adverse Reaction
Online Database, the ROR and IC values of
long-acting benzodiazepines were higher than those
of medium-acting benzodiazepines. In the PSSA,
ASRs of ultra-long- and long-acting benzodiazepines
were higher than those of short- and medium-acting
benzodiazepines at relatively short intervals. Given
these considerations, it is reasonable to assume that
the
strength
of
the
association
between
benzodiazepine use and dementia was stronger for
long-acting than for short-acting benzodiazepines.
This finding is consistent with a previously reported
case-control study investigating the relationship
between the risk of Alzheimer’s disease and exposure
to benzodiazepines [24]. In addition, the ASR of
benzodiazepines increased with the interval duration,

suggesting that long-term use of benzodiazepines
might be associated with an increased risk of
dementia. Although we did not directly investigate
the relationships between the benzodiazepine
cumulative dose and treatment duration and the risk
of dementia, our findings obtained from the PSSA
supported the hypothesis that long-term use of
benzodiazepines was associated with an increased
risk of dementia.
The association between benzodiazepine use and
dementia might be an early marker of a condition
associated with an increased risk of dementia rather
than a cause of the dementia itself. Some studies
suggested that the frequency of symptoms is highly
correlated with an increase in benzodiazepine
prescriptions during the years preceding a diagnosis
of dementia [12, 25, 26]. Therefore, the observed
association between benzodiazepine use and
dementia may be due to confounding by indication
and reverse causation. If reverse causation is
responsible
for
the
association
between
benzodiazepine use and dementia, the association for
recent users should be stronger than that for past
users. Imfeld et al. reported increased risks of
developing Alzheimer’s disease and vascular
dementia in those who started benzodiazepines <1
year before diagnosis, but not for those who started
them 2-4 years before diagnosis [23]. On the other
hand, Zhong et al. recently reported in a
meta-analysis that long-term benzodiazepine users
have an increased risk of dementia compared with
never users [7], attenuating the likelihood that reverse
causation plays a role. In our study, the risk of
dementia for benzodiazepines increased with the
interval duration in the PSSA. Furthermore, the
additional PSSA, in which patients who initiated a
new treatment with benzodiazepines close to the
prescription of anti-dementia drugs were excluded
from the analysis, also demonstrated significant
associations of benzodiazepine use with dementia
risk. These findings suggested that confounding by
indication and reverse causation bias may not have a
serious impact on the study. However, from the
perspective of drug action duration, ultra-long- and
long-acting benzodiazepines showed declining risks
with an increasing interval duration, suggesting that
reverse causation might play a role in some cases
during the early phase of treatment. Although this
finding might support the likelihood of reverse
causation having an influence, significantly increased
risks were observed for all classes of benzodiazepines
at the 48-month interval. Therefore, it is reasonable to
consider that long-term use of benzodiazepines is
associated with an increased risk of dementia.

Analysis of spontaneous reporting databases is a
useful method for identifying risk signals; however,
there are several potential limitations that should be
taken into account when interpreting the results. First,
there is no certainty that the reported event was
actually due to the drug. Second, not every adverse
event or medication error associated with a drug
product gets reported to the regulating authorities.
Third, no individual database or algorithm has been
found to be sufficient for signal detection. Therefore, a
different methodology, PSSA of the JMIRI
prescription database, was used to confirm the
findings from spontaneous reporting databases. Of
course, there are several potential limitations
associated with such an analysis based on a database
of prescriptions collected from pharmacies. First,
anti-Alzheimer’s disease drugs were used as
surrogate markers for dementia. Therefore, to be
precise, the association between benzodiazepine use
and Alzheimer’s disease was evaluated in the analysis
of the JMIRI database. In addition, individual cases
were not reviewed, and other causes were not
considered; therefore, some patients may not in fact
have had dementia. Conversely, the PSSA is similar to
the case-crossover design, in which exposures during
a fixed period before the case date (date when the
target outcome occurred) are compared with certain
prior dates in the same individual [27]. These
within-subject comparisons can thus be fully
controlled for potential confounding due to
between-subject differences and time-invariant
characteristics, e.g., age, gender, genetic factors,
mental health status, and other unknown
confounding factors. PSSA has been employed in a
number of previous studies investigating the
associations between use of certain target drugs and
potential adverse events [13, 14, 19, 20, 28], and the
validity of the PSSA has been confirmed by previous
studies [29, 30].
Although
a
plausible
pharmacological
mechanism for dementia is unknown, several theories
have been reported. Benzodiazepines have
deleterious effects on memory, and benzodiazepine
use induces both non-amnestic and amnestic mild
cognitive impairment [31, 32]. This effect may
precipitate dementia progression [33, 34]. Long-term
administration of benzodiazepines down-regulates
the levels of their binding receptors [35], resulting in a
cognitive decline [36]. We found that benzodiazepine
use, particularly long-acting drugs, might be
associated with increased risks of dementia. If these
observed associations are causal, benzodiazepines
should be used as briefly as possible to reduce
possible adverse reactions.

Conclusions
The results of a multi-methodological approach,
using different methods, algorithms, and databases,
suggest that benzodiazepine use, especially long-term
use and long-acting drugs, is associated with an
increased risk of dementia. Individuals prescribed
benzodiazepines should be considered to have an
increased risk of dementia. Although the biological
mechanism for this phenomenon remains unknown,
the risk of dementia associated with benzodiazepine
use is a very important finding in clinical practice.
Patients using benzodiazepines should be closely
monitored for the development of dementia in clinical
practice, and further studies are needed to confirm
our findings and elucidate the mechanisms
underlying benzodiazepine-induced dementia.
