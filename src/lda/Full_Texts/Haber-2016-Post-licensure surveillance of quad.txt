Quadrivalent inactivated inﬂuenza vaccines

a b s t r a c t
Background: Quadrivalent inactivated inﬂuenza vaccines (IIV4) were ﬁrst available for use during
2013−14 inﬂuenza season for individuals aged ≥6 months. IIV4 is designed to protect against four
different ﬂu viruses; two inﬂuenza A viruses and two inﬂuenza B viruses.
Methods: We searched the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) for US reports after IIV4 and
trivalent inactivated inﬂuenza vaccine (IIV3) from 7/1/2013–5/31/2015. Medical records were requested
for non-manufacturer reports classiﬁed as serious (i.e. death, hospitalization, prolonged hospitalization,
life-threatening illness, permanent disability). The review included automated data analysis, clinical
review of all serious reports, reports of special interest, and empirical Bayesian data mining.
Results: VAERS received 1,838 IIV4 reports; 512 (28%) in persons aged 6 months–17 years of which 42
(8.2%) were serious reports; 1,265 (69%) in persons aged >18 years of which 84 (6.6%) were serious reports;
two in children <6 months and 59 in persons of unknown age. Injection site erythema (24%), fever (14%)
and injection site swelling (17%) were the most frequent adverse events among persons aged 6 months–17
years, while injection site pain (16%), pain (15%) and pain in extremity (13%) were the most frequent
among persons aged 18−64 years given the vaccine alone. Among non-death serious reports, injection
site reactions, constitutional symptoms, Guillain-Barré syndrome, seizures, and anaphylaxis were the
most frequently reported adverse events. Data mining detected disproportional reporting for incorrect
vaccine administration with no associated adverse events. Adverse events following IIV4 reported to
VAERS were similar to those following IIV3.
Conclusions: In our review of VAERS reports, IIV4 had a similar safety proﬁle to IIV3. Most of the reported
AEs were non-serious. Our ﬁndings are consistent with data from pre-licensure studies of IIV4.

1. Introduction
In 2013, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended
inclusion of a second type B inﬂuenza virus in quadrivalent
inactivated inﬂuenza vaccines (IIV4) for the 2013−2014 inﬂuenza
season (WHO) [1]. However, one of the quadrivalent vaccine was
approved during 2012 and distributed in the subsequent inﬂuenza
season of 2013−14 [2]. On February 27, 2013, three IIV4 products
were approved for use in the general population and were available for the 2013−14 inﬂuenza season[3]: Fluarix® Quadrivalent,

(GlaxoSmithKline, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina) which
on December 14, 2012 was approved for use in persons ≥3 years of
age [2]; Fluzone® Quadrivalent (Sanoﬁ Pasteur, Swiftwater, Pennsylvania) which on June 7, 2013 was approved for use in persons ≥6
months of age [4]; and FluLaval® Quadrivalent GlaxoSmithKline,
which on August 16, 2013 was approved for use in persons ≥3
years of age [5]. In September 2013, The Advisory Committee
on Immunization Practices stated that although IIV4 includes a
second B virus, there is no preferential recommendation over IIV3
[6], and vaccination should not be delayed if only IIV3 is available.
In pre-licensure clinical trials, the most common adverse events
(AEs) were as follows: FluLaval Quadrivalent: local reactions,
muscle aches, irritability, headache, fatigue, and arthralgia [5]; Fluzone Quadrivalent: local reactions, irritability, drowsiness, malaise,

2508

anorexia, and myalgia, and headache [4]; and Fluarix Quadrivalent:
local reactions, irritability, muscle aches, headache, and fatigue [3].
We analyzed reports to VAERS following IIV4 from July 1, 2013
through May 31, 2015 to assess safety of IIV4 during the two initial
seasons, using IIV3 reports as a comparator vaccine.
2. Methods
2.1. Data source
VAERS is a national spontaneous reporting system, established
in 1990 and co-administered by the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention (CDC) and FDA that accepts reports of AEs following immunization [7,8]. VAERS accepts reports from vaccine
manufacturers, healthcare providers, vaccine recipients (or their
parents/guardians). The VAERS form collects information on demographic characteristics of the vaccine recipient, type of vaccine(s)
received and AEs experienced. A Report may be classiﬁed as serious based on the Code of Federal Regulations if one or more of
the following are reported: death, life-threatening illness, hospitalization, prolongation of hospitalization, or permanent disability
[10]. For serious reports from sources other than manufacturers,
medical records are routinely requested. Signs and symptoms of
AEs are coded using an internationally standardized terminology
from the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA)
[9]. Each report may be assigned one or more MedDRA Preferred
Terms (PTs); PTs are not conﬁrmed medical diagnoses.
We analyzed VAERS reports for individuals who received IIV4
from July 1, 2013 through May 31, 2015. We included reports
of persons who received Fluarix Quadrivalent, FluLaval Quadrivalent, or Fluzone Quadrivalent. We excluded reports with unknown
inﬂuenza vaccine name and/or vaccine manufacturer and non-US
reports. Duplicate reports were consolidated.
We compared the AEs reported after IIV4 with the corresponding IIV3 vaccines that were available during the same time
period: Fluarix, FluLaval, and Fluzone (excluding Fluzone HighDose and Fluzone Intradermal). Reports were sub-divided into two
age groups: 6 months–17 years, and >18 years.
2.2. Descriptive statistics
We calculated descriptive statistics including the mean and
median age of vaccinated individuals, AE onset interval (from vaccination date [day 0] to the reported onset of ﬁrst symptoms), and
the most common MedDRA PTs. We also reviewed reports pertaining to children <6 months of age (who would have received the
vaccine in error) and included persons of unknown or unspeciﬁed
age. We used SAS (version 9.3, SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC, USA) for
data analysis.
2.3. Clinical review
We conducted clinical review of reports which involved review
of all documentation (VAERS reports, medical records, autopsy
report) on the AE and an assessment of the clinical characteristics of the medical event, condition/s following vaccination which
motivated its reporting to VAERS. We also conducted clinical
review for non-serious reports in the following categories, which
were not mutually exclusive: (1) pre-speciﬁed conditions based on
previous studies or clinical judgment including Guillain-Barre syndrome [GBS], anaphylaxis, febrile seizures, and vaccinations during
pregnancy [11–19]; and (2) reports suggesting that IIV4 was administered “off label” or accidentally to individuals outside the age
indication for each vaccine. For the review of serious cases, we
ascertained the primary event (the event that appeared to be the

main reason for the report to VAERS) and categorized the case based
on the MedDRA System Organ Class (SOC) [9].
Cause of death was determined from information in the autopsy
report, death certiﬁcate or medical records. We did not assess
causality between the AE and the vaccine or whether a vaccination error contributed to an AE. Reports of GBS and anaphylaxis
were classiﬁed using the Brighton Collaboration criteria and in
addition we used physician’s diagnosis documented on the medical
records [12,13]. For GBS, we reviewed any available information
about nerve conduction studies, nadir of neurological symptoms,
physical exam ﬁndings (e.g. weakness, hyporeﬂexia), cerebrospinal
ﬂuid analysis, magnetic resonance imaging. For reports of anaphylaxis, we noted tryptase and radio-allergosorbent test results, if
they were available.
2.4. Disproportionality analysis (data mining)
We applied Empirical Bayesian (EB) data mining methods to
identify disproportionality [20,21] of vaccine-AE reporting, that is,
PTs that were reported more frequently than expected following
IIV4 vaccines compared with other vaccines (including IIV3), with
adjustment for age, sex, and other variables. We used published
criteria by Szarfman et al. [21] to identify, for each licensed IIV4
product, adverse events that were reported more frequently after
IIV4 than other vaccines (i.e. EB05 ≥ 2, where EB02 represents the
lower bound of the 90% conﬁdence interval surrounding the EB geometric mean). We reviewed reports and available medical records
for AEs that met or exceeded that threshold.
Because VAERS is a routine surveillance program that does not
meet the deﬁnition of research, it is not subject to Institutional
Review Board review and informed consent requirements.
3. Results
3.1. Descriptive analysis
During the study period, VAERS received a total of 1,838 US IIV4
reports, 521 during 2013−14 season and 1276 during 2014−15 season. Of these reports, 512 (28%) were in persons aged 6 months–17
years which included 36 non-death serious reports and six death
reports; 1,265 (69%)) in persons aged >18 years, which included
78 non-death serious reports and six death reports; two were
children <6 months and 59 were in persons of unknown age
(Table 1a and 1b). Among adult reports, 199 (11%) were in persons
aged ≥ 65 years. Characteristics of these reports were similar to that
of adults 18−64 years and the most common PTs were pain in the
extremity (19%), injection site erythema (17%), fever and injection
site pain, both (15%).
Report characteristics and the most frequent MedDRA PTs for
IIV4 reports during the 2013−15 inﬂuenza seasons compared with
IIV3 reports during the same two seasons are summarized in Table
1a and 1b.
3.2. Clinical review
3.2.1. Death reports
We identiﬁed 12 death reports after IIV4, six in children and six
in adults. Most of these reports (10; 83%) listed IIV4 as the only vaccine administered on that date. Nine individuals had an underlying
chronic condition or other complex medical history. There was no
evident clustering in the causes of death, pre-existing comorbidities, age, or interval from vaccination to death.
3.2.2. Non-death serious reports
The two most frequently reported categories of non-death serious SOCs were nervous system disorders (33, 25.9%) and general

disorders and administration site conditions (32, 25.2%). The most
frequent speciﬁc AEs were injection site reactions, GBS, seizures,
and anaphylaxis (Table 2).
3.2.2.1. Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS). We identiﬁed 14 reports
of possible GBS after IIV4 during 2013−2015, of which 13 were
classiﬁed as serious. The median onset interval of symptoms was
13 days (range 0–24 days). Median age was 45 years (range 21
months–67 years); eight cases were female and six were male.
Twelve cases met the Brighton Collaboration case deﬁnition
[12] for GBS (six level 1, ﬁve level 2, one level 3), one did not
meet Brighton criteria but was diagnosed as GBS by a physician
according to medical records, and one non-serious case involved
treatment in an emergency department but did not include medical records so the diagnosis could not be veriﬁed. We attempted
to review nerve conduction studies, cerebrospinal ﬂuid analysis, and magnetic resonance imaging, but some reports did not
provide any documentation. Twelve reports listed IIV4 as the
only vaccine administered, two received also Pneumovax and one
Varivax. Two patients reportedly presented with upper respiratory

infection or inﬂuenza-like-illness within 7–14 days prior to vaccination. Based on the most recent information at the time the
VAERS form was submitted, 11 of the 14 reported cases had fully
recovered.
3.2.2.2. Anaphylaxis. We identiﬁed 19 reports of possible anaphylaxis. Brighton criteria [13] were applied to six reports: two
cases met the Brighton Collaboration criteria for level 1 and four
met level 2 criteria. Six reports - diagnosed anaphylaxis did not
meet Brighton criteria but were physician-diagnosed anaphylaxis.
Two reports of possible anaphylaxis did not have medical records
and could not be veriﬁed. The remaining ﬁve reports described
allergic-type reactions but did not meet Brighton criteria. We
attempted to review results of tryptase and radio-allergosorbent
testing, but the reports did not include this information. Of the 19
reports, six were classiﬁed as serious. Of the 19 reports, 12 required
epinephrine (10 anaphylaxis and two non-anaphylaxis allergic
reactions). In three reports, IIV4 was given with other vaccines,
thus impeding the ability to assess a possible relationship with
IIV4. None of the reports stated that the patient had a history of egg

allergy or allergic reaction to previous inﬂuenza vaccine. For each
IIV4 product compared with other vaccines, no disproportionate
reporting was found for either GBS or anaphylaxis.
3.2.2.3. Febrile seizures. We identiﬁed 18 reports of febrile
seizures; 12 were veriﬁed. Age ranged from 4 to 35 months; 11
reports were in males and seven in females. Median onset interval from vaccination to febrile seizure onset was 12 h (range 0–12
days). Four febrile seizures were classiﬁed as serious. In 14 (78%)
reports, IIV4 was given concurrently with other vaccines. All 18
children reportedly recovered.
3.2.2.4. Vaccination in pregnancy. We identiﬁed 36 reports of
pregnant women who received IIV4 with a median age of 32 years
(range 15–42 years); 34 received IIV4 alone. Twenty-three reports
speciﬁed the trimester of pregnancy: nine in ﬁrst trimester, nine
in second trimester, and ﬁve in the third trimester. Three reports
described an AE related to pregnancy: spontaneous abortion,
uterine bleeding, and trisomy (one report each). Twelve reports
described AEs that were not directly related to the pregnancy,
e.g. injection site reactions, allergic reactions, and musculoskeletal
symptoms. Twenty-one reports did not describe an AE.
3.2.2.5. Vaccine administration outside the recommended age.
VAERS received two non-serious reports in children aged <6
months who received Fluzone Quadrivalent; A 4-month-old female

experienced fever and watery diarrhea. A 2-month-old female was
vaccinated with IIV4, but no AEs were reported.
There were also 18 reports of children aged <3 years who
received Flu Laval Quadrivalent or Fluarix Quadrivalent, which are
both approved for use in patients 3 years and older. Two children,
aged 8 months and 13 months, each experienced vomiting, fever,
jerky movements, and dyspnea. A 6-month-old female experienced rotator cuff syndrome/injection site pain. All three reportedly
recovered. The other 15 reports did not mention an AE.
3.3. Data mining
During the 2013−2014 inﬂuenza season, empirical Bayesian
analysis did not detect any EB05 >2 for Fluarix Quadrivalent,
FluLaval Quadrivalent, or Fluzone Quadrivalent. For the 2014−2015
inﬂuenza season, data mining analysis revealed disproportional
reporting compared with other vaccines for the PTs “incorrect dose
administered” (n = 21) and “underdose” (n = 17) following IIV4 compared with other vaccines. These reports were non-serious, and
they did not describe any adverse effects per se.
4. Discussion
During the 2013−2014 and 2014−2015 inﬂuenza seasons,
approximately 70 million doses of IIV4 were distributed for use in
the United States (data shown with permission of GSK and Sanoﬁ).
Our review of AEs reported to VAERS following IIV4 did not identify any unexpected AEs or new safety concerns. This represents the
ﬁrst post-licensure safety assessment of IIV4 and adds to the existing body of evidence on the safety of seasonal inﬂuenza vaccines.
The AEs reported to VAERS following IIV4, whether administered
alone or with other vaccines, in the two age-groups were similar to
those reported after IIV3.
Approximately, 93% of IIV4 reports were non-serious and the
most common AEs were mild, self-limited conditions (e.g. injection
site reactions and fever) that were also observed during the prelicensure clinical trials [3–5].
GBS is an acute, immune-mediated demyelinating disorder of
the peripheral nervous system. Although the 1976 swine ﬂu vaccine was found to be causally associated with GBS [11], evidence of
a possible association of GBS with inactivated seasonal inﬂuenza
vaccines has been inconsistent [14,22–25]. Given this potential
association, GBS is closely monitored by CDC and FDA using VAERS
and other systems [26]. Our study veriﬁed 13 GBS reports with
symptom onset within 42 days of vaccination for a reporting rate of
0.19 cases per million doses of vaccine distributed, which is below
the estimated background incidence of GBS [25,27]. Our data mining analysis did not identify any disproportionate reporting for GBS
for any of the IIV4 products, compared with other vaccines.
Anaphylaxis may be causally associated with vaccination in rare
instances including with inﬂuenza vaccines [14,15]. For all three
of the IIV4 products, the contraindications include “severe allergic reactions (e.g. anaphylaxis) to any component of the vaccine,
including egg protein, or following a previous dose of any inﬂuenza
vaccine” [3–5]. We veriﬁed 12 cases of anaphylaxis reported to
VAERS after IIV4 with reporting rate of 0.17 per million inﬂuenza
doses distributed, which is below the expected rate of 1.35 per
million IIV3 vaccine doses [28]. Most recently, there is increasing
evidence the IIV is safe when administered to persons with egg
allergy, [29]. None of the anaphylaxis reports in this series mentioned an egg allergy or allergic reaction to previous vaccine. Thus,
this potentially life-threatening event can occur even in the absence
of any known or suspected hypersensitivity.
We veriﬁed 12 reports of febrile seizures in children; 80% of
children in these reports received other vaccines on the same visit.

P. Haber et al. / Vaccine 34 (2016) 2507–2512

During the 2010−2011 inﬂuenza season, a vaccine safety signal for
febrile seizures after trivalent inactivated inﬂuenza vaccine among
children aged 6−23 months was identiﬁed in VAERS [16] and subsequent studies supported the potential for an association during
this season [17,18]. In other years, an increased risk of febrile
seizure has not been found following sole administration of IIV3
[30].
Inactivated inﬂuenza vaccines are recommended at any time
during pregnancy, due to the risk of inﬂuenza-related complications among pregnant women [6,31]. Vaccination during
pregnancy with IIV3 has been found to be safe [32,33]. Our review
of VAERS data did not identify any safety concerns with regard to
IIV4 vaccination in pregnancy.
VAERS has many important limitations, including underreporting, incomplete information, varying quality of reports, and lack
of an unvaccinated comparison group [7,8]. Medical records of
serious reports obtained through follow-up may not contain important key clinical and/or laboratory information. Because of these
limitations, it is usually not possible to determine causal associations between vaccines and AEs from VAERS reports. However, as a
national surveillance system, VAERS can be used to rapidly detect
rare AEs and potential vaccine safety problems, which can be further explored in carefully designed epidemiological studies [34].
Our review of VAERS reports following IIV4 did not identify any
new safety signals, which are similar to the results of prior VAERS
study [35].

5. Conclusion
Inﬂuenza vaccination is the best way to protect against inﬂuenza
disease and its complications [6,36]. IIV4 vaccines provide protection against two inﬂuenza A and two inﬂuenza B viruses [3–6].
In our review of VAERS, we did not identify any safety concerns
for IIV4 vaccination. Most of the AEs reported to VAERS following IIV4 were non-serious and were similar to those reported after
IIV3.
