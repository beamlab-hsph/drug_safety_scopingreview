ABSTRACT

ARTICLE HISTORY

Objectives: Quantitative data mining methods can be used to identify potential signals of unexpected
relationships between drug and adverse event (AE). This study aims to compare and explore the use of
three data mining methods in our small spontaneous AE database.
Methods: We consider reporting odds ratio (ROR), Bayesian Confidence Propagation Neural Network
(BCPNN) and Gamma Poisson Shrinker (GPS) assuming two different sets of criteria: (1) ROR–1.96SE>1,
IC–1.96SD>0, EB05>1 (2) ROR–1.96SE>2, IC–1.96SD>1, EB05 >2. Count of drug-AE pairs ≥3 was considered for ROR and GPS.
Results: The Health Sciences Authority, Singapore received 151,180 AE reports between 1993 and 2013.
ROR, BCPNN and GPS identified 2,835, 2,311 and 2,374 significant drug-AE pairs using Criterion 1, and
1,899, 1,101 and 1,358 respectively using Criterion 2. The performance of the three methods with
respect to specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value were similar, although ROR
yielded a higher sensitivity and larger area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. ROR and
GPS picked up some potential signals which BCPNN missed.
Conclusions: The defined threshold used for ROR (Criterion 1) is a useful screening tool for our small
database. It may be used in conjunction with GPS to avoid missed signals.

1. Introduction
Continued safety monitoring of drugs through spontaneous
reporting of suspected adverse events (AEs) by healthcare professionals is an important element of pharmacovigilance as they
are reported based on clinical observations.[1] Spontaneous
anecdotal reports and case series contribute to help drug regulators and pharmaceutical companies in identifying rare AEs
that are too infrequent to be detected in clinical trials.
The standard procedure of identifying potential safety signals from spontaneous AE reporting usually involves regular
manual screening and detailed clinical review of reports.
Statistical methodologies to evaluate spontaneous AE reports
and identify rare AEs were first described in the 1960s and
1970s,[2,3] but the interest increased in the mid-1990s when
various quantitative signal detection methods of spontaneous
reporting systems were developed to search for patterns of
interest in the data. Many national drug monitoring centers in
various countries have evaluated the different signaling methodologies and utilize their AE databases to generate hypothesis, examine the drug–AE relationships, find trends, and
determine the need for additional analyses.[4–7] Quantitative
data mining methods on spontaneous AE reports are generally
based on the calculation of disproportionality measures. In the
area of pharmacovigilance, there are the ‘frequentist’ methods
such as the reporting odds ratio (ROR) and the ‘Bayesian’

methods such as Bayesian Confidence Propagation Neural
Network (BCPNN) and Gamma Poisson Shrinker (GPS).[8–14]
The analyses are based on observed reporting relationships
and aim to identify drug–AE association with a relative frequency that differs substantially from the overall reporting in
the database. These methods use total reporting as a surrogate denominator for examining particular AEs.
The Adverse Event Monitoring Programme under the
Vigilance and Compliance Branch of the Health Sciences
Authority (HSA), Singapore, has been receiving spontaneous
AE reports from medical doctors, dentists, pharmacists, nurses,
and pharmaceutical companies since 1993. In relation to AE
reporting, Singapore has an annual reporting rate of over 500
reports per million inhabitants since 2006. The total population in 2013 was close to 5.4 million.[15]
Data mining methods usually involve large databases that can
range from hundreds of thousands to millions of records.[16]
However, the size of our local population and the total number
of spontaneous AE reports database are considered small when
compared to other more developed regulators’ databases.
Although there is no consensus with regard to the minimum
number of reports and/or drug–AE pairs that are available in a
database before quantitative signal detection techniques can be
employed, data mining of small databases can result in statistical
instability associated with disproportionalities.

The objective of this study is to compare the performance
of three methods of quantitative signal detection and explore
the feasibility of their use when applied to a relatively small
spontaneous AE reports databases in Singapore.

2. Methods
2.1. Data processing
All reports received by the HSA over a 21-year period between
1993 and 2013 were included in the analyses. Pharmaceutical
companies are legally mandated to report AEs to HSA while
healthcare professionals report suspected AEs on a voluntary
basis and patients are encouraged to get their healthcare
professionals to report – no reports direct from consumers
are currently accepted. The reporter would submit a report
when there is a suspicion that the AE may be attributable to
the drug. An AE report is submitted on a standard reporting
form which records the patient’s details such as gender, age
and ethnic group, AE, health product(s) suspected of causing
the AE, patient’s outcome, reporter’s details including name,
institution, contacts, as well as other relevant information for
assessment. The form can be sent to HSA via fax, mail, or
electronically through the Internet or Critical Medical
Information Store (CMIS) system. The CMIS is a shared electronic repository of medical alerts and drug allergies developed
jointly by the Ministry of Health, Singapore, and the public
healthcare sector.[17] This reporting platform is available in
the public restructured hospitals and polyclinics to enable
healthcare professionals to enter drug allergies and AEs into
the CMIS at the point of care. The information is captured in
the patient’s electronic medical record, and this facilitates
information sharing among the public healthcare institutions.
Since 2006, the Vigilance and Compliance Branch has been
receiving information on drug allergies and AEs from the
public healthcare institutions in real time via CMIS and as a
result there was a surge in the number of AE reports.
All follow-up of reports, if any, were consolidated into the
original initial report and the data were captured using Oracle
database. The data entry was done by trained personnel and
the reports were reviewed by two pharmacists. Consistent
usage of standardized drug naming and reaction coding
were employed. The reports were codified according to the
WHO Adverse Reaction Terminology (WHO-ART).[18] For the
purpose of data analyses, WHO-preferred terms are used for
comparisons.

‘Bayesian’ approaches examine the ratios of the observed to
expected reporting for specific drug–AE pairs to detect a
potential signal of disproportionate reporting. BCPNN assumes
a prior belief that involves beta distribution, and the strength
of association between the drug–AE pair is defined by IC. GPS
assumes a prior belief that involves a mixture of two gamma
distributions, and the empirical Bayes geometric mean (EBGM)
of the posterior distribution compares the observed versus
expected count relative risk. The threshold is defined by
EB05, the fifth percentile of EBGM.
A measure of precision (i.e. confidence interval) is calculated around each estimate of drug–AE pair so as to reduce
reliance on point estimate and examine the level of certainty.
For the purpose of surveillance, the signal of disproportionate
reporting was considered to be statistically significant when
the lower confidence limit of the point estimate exceeded the
defined threshold value of the test statistics. This corresponded to a relative excess in number of reports for that
particular drug–AE pair against the background data. For
example, a positive value of IC for the BCPNN suggests that
the observed number of reports in the drug–AE pair is more
frequent than the expected number derived from all drugs
and AEs in the database, and this may indicate a potential
drug safety issue.
The ROR cannot be estimated when there is no report of
other AEs for the drug of interest or when the AE of interest
has not occurred with any other drugs. To overcome this
limitation, 0.5 was added to the observed frequency of each
cell when computing the ROR.[20] A criterion based on minimum count of drug–AE pairs (N ≥ 3) was imposed on the
analyses of ROR as small cell counts with one or two reports
can result in statistical instability associated with disproportionalities. The presence of the count threshold will also filter
out ‘noise’ or false positive associations.[21] It is generally
noted that more than one report is required to generate a
potential signal.[22] The criterion N ≥ 3 is not required for
BCPNN as this technique ‘shrinks’ the estimate based on prior
probabilities to account for low cell counts.[23] In our analyses, we used GPS with a criterion N ≥ 3 so that it becomes
comparable with ROR. Table 1 summarizes the thresholds for
various methods. Two sets of signaling criteria were used to
evaluate how the performance of the methods would be
affected by varying the thresholds. A more stringent threshold
was set for Criterion 2 as compared to Criterion 1. We further
compare the increase in signals generated across the years as
well as examine the disappearance of signals in relation to
previous year’s report. Data were extracted from the Oracle

2.2. Signal generation – data mining methods
Three methods were compared: (i) ROR, (ii) BCPNN with information component (IC) as a measure of association,[19] and
(iii) GPS which uses the empirical Bayes (EB) technique.
The analysis via ROR is based on 2 × 2 contingency tables
that tabulate reports according to the presence/absence of
the suspected drug of interest and the presence/absence of
the reaction of interest. Drug–AE pairs are constructed by
pairing each suspected drug with the observed AE term
reported. The disproportionality analyses assume that each
drug–AE pair occurs independently of the other pairs. The

2.3. Signal evaluation

Factors such as seriousness of AEs and whether the drug–AE
pairs are labeled are important in contributing to the selection
of drug–AE pairs for further evaluation. The drug–AE pairs were
considered as labeled if they were mentioned in the
Micromedex® [25] or current regulatory agency–approved
drug labels, including Singapore, the United States, Canada,
and New Zealand. It could be exact word-to-word matching
or synonymously labeled (same meaning). If the drug–AE pairs
were not mentioned in these references, they would be considered non-labeled. The AE terms were considered as serious if
they exist in the WHO critical terms list or medically significant
suspected serious adverse drug reaction by the US Food and
Drug Administration (FDA) or Important Medical Event Terms
(IME) list developed by the EudraVigilance Expert Working
Group.[18,26,27] The IME used the Medical Dictionary for
Regulatory Activities terminologies and we matched them to
WHO-ART. To compare the performance of the three methods
in detecting signals of spontaneous database, we evaluate their
sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value (NPV), and positive predictive value (PPV) using information from the
Micromedex®, and drug labels as gold standard and the formula
for the calculations are as shown in Table 2. The performance of
the three methods was also evaluated based on the receiver
operating characteristic (ROC) curves.

3. Results
A total of 151,180 AE reports from 133,860 patients received
by HSA over a 21-year period between 1993 and 2013 were
analyzed. This involves 1569 single or combination active
ingredients and results in 200,787 drug–AE pairs or 23,183
unique drug–AE pairs. The number of significant drug–AE
pairs picked up by ROR, BCPNN, and GPS using Criterion 1

were 2835, 2311, and 2374, respectively (Figure 1). The number of significant drug–AE pairs picked up by ROR, BCPNN, and
GPS using Criterion 2 were 1899, 1101, and 1358, respectively.
The signals of disproportionate reporting generated by BCPNN
were a subset of those generated by ROR and GPS regardless
of which criterion was used. When Criterion 2 was used, the
number of signals of disproportionate reporting generated by
BCPNN and GPS were both subsets of ROR.
In Table 3, we compared the increase in signals across the
years as well as examine the disappearance of signals in relation to previous year’s report. Generally, the results generated
by the three methods were comparable, with about 1–4% of
the signals disappear when new set of data were added. The
increase in signals from 1 year to the next ranged from 11–
22%. About 1–5% of the signals were new pairs not present in
the previous year.
We reviewed the seriousness of AEs and whether the
23,183 drug–AE pairs are labeled or non-labeled. In this
study, the percentages of serious and non-serious AEs
detected by each of the methods are similar for both labeled
and non-labeled AEs. Using signaling criteria with higher

thresholds as in Criterion 2 resulted in a higher percentage of
serious AEs being detected than Criterion 1 (Table 4). All the
serious AEs picked up by Criterion 2 were also picked up by
Criterion 1.
For the 60 potential signals of disproportionate reporting
missed by BCPNN, ROR, and GPS picked up 54 labeled signals
(14 serious) based on Criterion 1 (Figure 1). Further, of the six
signals which were non-labeled, two were serious. For the
three signals picked up by GPS alone, two were labeled as
serious and one non-serious. ROR alone picked up 411 labeled
signals (113 serious) and 53 non-labeled signals (17 serious).
The performance of the three methods with respect to
specificity, PPV, and NPV were similar with estimates hovering
around 97%, 90%, and 32%, respectively (Table 4). However, in
terms of sensitivity, ROR seems to yield slightly higher sensitivity as compared to BCPNN and GPS regardless of the criteria
used. Based on the ROC curves, ROR showed better sensitivity
for prespecified specificity as compared to the other two
methods regardless of which criteria were used (Figure 2).
The three methods performed better with Criterion 1 rather
than Criterion 2.

4. Discussion
This is the first study that explores the implementation of
quantitative signal detection methods using the Singapore
spontaneous AE database. Prior to applying these data mining
methods, standard procedures with multiple approaches to
identify potential safety signals from spontaneous AE reporting are routinely applied. Traditional manual review of all
reports is generally satisfactory when the volume of data is
manageable. With greater awareness of the importance of
pharmacovigilance and with the introduction of electronic
reporting channel via the CMIS system, the reporting rates
are now higher as compared to the start of the AE monitoring
program in 1993. There is, thus, a greater urgency for more
effective use of quantitative data mining methods.
Consistent with several studies,[28,29] we observed that
the signals of disproportionate reporting generated by
BCPNN were subsets of ROR and GPS. In particular, it had
detected substantially fewer potential signals than ROR and
GPS, and many of these were labeled suggesting a possibility
of under-detection by BCPNN. Although BCPNN has been used
as gold standard in some studies,[4,30,31] in the context in our
small database, we should not rely on BCPNN alone for detecting potential safety signals of spontaneous AE reports using
conventional threshold. The ‘shrinkage’ used by both Bayesian
methods will be less likely to produce signals with small values
of either observed or expected counts. This can be a desirable
property in triage of signals to reduce emphasis on those
based on more limited data.
Analyses based on our small database showed low sensitivity in all the three methods explored. This was similarly
observed in the MedWatch database of the US FDA in the
early years of 1970s and 1980s when the number of drug–AE
pairs were also small.[14] However, as we used Micromedex®
and drug labels as references, in contrast to the FDA report
which used only the drug labels, we observed marginally
lower sensitivity with our data.

Setting of statistical thresholds to define drug–AE signals is
arbitrary and requires some compromise. High threshold may
miss true signals while low threshold may give rise to many
false positive signals. There may not be a one-size-fits-all
threshold for databases of varying sizes. As such, we have
explored more stringent threshold based on Criterion 2 and
evaluated its impact on signal detection in our small local
database. As compared to Criterion 1, Criterion 2 exhibited a
lower sensitivity of 6.1–10.4%, and this may result in important
potential signals being missed.
While there is no real basis for setting a minimum count of
drug–AE pairs before a potential signal of disproportionate
reporting is declared, we explored ROR with a minimum
count of drug–AE pairs greater than three to reduce the
number of false positives. Other studies ran GPS without setting a minimum count of drug–AE pairs.[14] However, when
we did not specify N ≥ 3 for GPS, the method flagged out 553
drug–AE pairs with two counts which were not picked up by
BCPNN and ROR with N ≥ 3 based on Criterion 1. Of these 553
drug–AE pairs, 50% were non-serious AEs. It is comforting to

note that if we did not impose the restriction on minimum
count for ROR, it would also have picked up all of these signals
except the three identified in Figure 1. Potential signals based
on two reports may be too early to trigger a safety concern
and in order to facilitate comparison of methods, we include a
minimum count of drug–AE pairs (N ≥ 3) for GPS. It was noted
that whether we consider a minimum count of N > 3 or ≥3,
there was no difference in the number of potential signals
flagged by ROR or GPS.
ROR picked up some potential signals which BCPNN and to
a lesser extent GPS did not. This could be due to our small
database which also lacks diversity. It includes a non-negligible fraction of commonly reported drug classes/drugs such as
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (22%), beta-lactam antibiotics (15%), and paracetamol (6%). Further, the commonly
reported AEs by system organ classes include skin and appendage disorders (e.g. angioedema, pruritus, rash) which
accounts for 51% of the total number of AEs. Almenoff et al.
had suggested that the spontaneous AE report database
should be of adequate size and diversity for evaluating disproportionate reporting.[32] Holle and Bauchau had also
demonstrated the impact of the violation of hidden assumptions of the Bayesian methods when the drugs or AEs represented a substantial portion of the database. This may result in
low sensitivity of these methods which was also evident in our
results.[33] Norén et al. had indicated that the Bayesian shrinkage provided a conservative measure of association and
reduced the risk of highlighting spurious associations, in particular, for events with very low expected frequency.[19] Thus,
the observed-to-expected ratios as a measure of disproportionality would be useful, particularly, if the AEs are reasonably
rare.[34]
Nevertheless, quantitative signal detection methods can be
a valuable tool for national pharmacovigilance centers with
small spontaneous AE reports database to triage, detect, and
assess safety signals. The results are interpreted alongside clinical information and review. The Vigilance and Compliance
Branch is refining the operational processes to evaluate and
manage the drug–AE pairs generated from quantitative data
mining methods. The defined thresholds used in Criterion 1
would be a reasonable screening tool for our routine assessment of potential AE signals in view of the good PPVs, high
specificity, and higher sensitivity than Criterion 2. The team
seeks to evaluate new drug–AE pairs that are picked up by
the quantitative data mining methods as statistically significant

as well as existing drug–AE pairs when there are significant
changes in signal profiles. There are some AE reports which
require clinical review irrespective of the results of the quantitative data mining methods; these include reports with fatal
outcome and serious AE reports associated with traditional
medicinal products. For the latter, the products were sent to
the analytical laboratory for testing of possible adulteration
with other substances. A detailed description of the signal
management process is provided in Figure 3.
For the review of existing drug–AE pairs, there is no universal rule set for the magnitude of percentage increase in
signal profiles as the trigger point for review varies between
regulatory agencies. It could be a change in proportion of
reports by ≥8% compared to previous last quarter or an
increase in the test estimates of at least 2.[13,18] The frequency of generating data for reanalyses to look for new
potential signals and trend will depend on the manpower

AE reports received

resources and rate of new potential signals generated per
unit time. It could be weekly, monthly, or quarterly. Each
pharmacovigilance center will need to establish its own systematic approach to signal detection.
The Vigilance and Compliance Branch communicates safety
information to local healthcare professionals on drug safety
signals detected and regulatory decisions made. One of the
communication channels is the HSA Adverse Drug Reaction
News bulletin which is published thrice yearly. Going through
the past 6-year issues from 2008 to 2013, the following drug–
AE pairs were highlighted through manual screening and
review of reports: rosiglitazone and cardiovascular AEs, allopurinol and adverse skin AEs, carbamazepine and adverse skin
AEs, oseltamivir and neuropsychiatric events, bisphosphonates
and atypical fracture, zoledronate and osteomyelitis, BCG vaccine and lymphadenitis, and strontium ranelate and adverse
skin AEs. These drug–AE pairs were also flagged as statistically

significant by ROR, BCPNN, and/or GPS in our analysis. A
review of the HSA Adverse Drug Reaction News bulletins and
Dear Healthcare Professional Letters published from January
2014 to August 2015 based on overseas safety signal showed
that drug safety issues such as dabigatran and hemorrhage,
ketoconazole and hepatitis, ketoconazole and jaundice, simvastatin and myopathy, and metoclopramide and tardive dyskinesia were picked up as potential signals by ROR, BCPNN,
and GPS in 2013. However, we are mindful that statistical
disproportionality approaches do not account for the quality
of reports. Elevated statistical value indicating a potential
signal may not reflect a real causal relationship between the
drug and the occurrence of the AE while, on the other hand,
an absence of a signal does not rule out the possibility of an
association. They need to be interpreted with caution as there
could be other explanations or factors that affect the results.
There are limitations in data mining of spontaneous AE
reports databases. While we have attempted to construct a
gold standard of drug–AE associations using Micromedex® and
drug labels to establish the true positives and negatives, we
are mindful that the reference set of labeled AEs may be
subjected to changes with new information added. Besides,
not every labeled AE is subjected to formal epidemiological
assessment. In this study, we include spontaneous AE reports
received from 1993 to 2013; however, the information we
retrieved from Micromedex® may include AE information
updated after 2013. As physicians may not report AEs if they
are not aware of the association between the AEs and drug
consumption at the time of reporting, this could contribute to
the observed low sensitivity of the three methods in our study.
Voluntary reporting of AEs by healthcare professionals is
known to be associated with subjective judgment and underreporting, as generally only a fraction of all AEs is actually
reported to the regulatory agency.[35] Other factors such as
duration of drug availability in the market and the market size
may also affect the cumulative reporting rate of the AEs.
[36,37] However, the reporting bias will affect all drugs in
approximately equal extent and thus it is unlikely to greatly
bias the results. A review of the local reporting pattern by
healthcare professionals after each publication of the HSA
adverse drug reaction news bulletin containing drug safety–
related issues revealed that, in general, it had not led to an
increase in the reporting of drug–AE pairs.
The ‘frequentist’ disproportionate measures are very sensitive to small fluctuations in the number of reports. For
routine review, the ease and extent of the process of identifying duplicates will depend on the availability of key fields
such as unique identification number, patients’ demographics, suspected drug(s), and date of onset of AE. In
Singapore, all Singapore citizens and permanent residents
and children born in Singapore are assigned with unique
identification numbers. Foreigners who are issued with immigration and work passes are given foreign identification
numbers. Between 1993 and 2013, there was a small percentage of reports (2954 reports or 2%) without patients’ identification or record numbers. Further analysis to handle
suspected duplication by removing reports without patients’
identification or record numbers will be implemented in
future studies.

The coding of AE description with WHO-ART is an important component in the data mining process as poor or absent
supporting clinical information can lead to inappropriate use
of an AE terminology. Inter-reporter and intra-reporter variability in choice of coding terms can lead to systematic differences that affect subsequent data analysis.[34]
Another limitation of our study is that we did not examine
the pattern of AE reporting before and after the introduction
of CMIS, that is, a new reporting platform in the public restructured hospitals and polyclinics in 2006. Between 1993 and
2005, the average annual percentage of AE reports received
from public restructured hospitals and polyclinics was 65.1%
and after 2005 it raised to 97.3%.
While acknowledging the limitations of analyzing spontaneous AE reporting databases, measures of disproportionality
nevertheless provide a worthwhile comparison with regard to
the frequency of occurrence of AEs between drugs. Several
global initiatives were taken to explore data mining of hospitals’ electronic healthcare records. Electronic healthcare
records are becoming a valuable data source for active drug
safety surveillance.[38] The combination of both passive and
active safety surveillance systems will provide a stronger and
more effective system for drug regulators to monitor the
safety of health product. An efficient and effective active
safety surveillance system will require a concerted endeavor
between various stakeholders, with the adoption of technology platform for information management and data analytics
to sift through noise and pick up drug safety signals.

5. Conclusions
The defined threshold used in Criterion 1 for ROR is a useful
screening tool for our small database. It may be used in
conjunction with GPS to avoid missed potential signals of
disproportionate reporting.
