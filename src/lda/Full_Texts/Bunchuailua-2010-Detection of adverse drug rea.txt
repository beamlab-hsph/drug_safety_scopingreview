Detection of Adverse Drug Reaction Signals in
the Thai FDA Database: Comparison Between
Reporting Odds Ratio and Bayesian Confidence
Propagation Neural Network Methods
The study aimed to compare performance between the reporting odds ratio (ROR) and the
Bayesian confidence propagation neural network (BCPNN)methods in identifiing serious
adverse drug reactions (ADRs) using the Thai
FDA spontaneous database. The two methods
were retrospectively applied to identifi new, serious ADRs reported with antiretroviral therapy (ART) drugs using the data set between
1990 and 2006.We plotted the ROR and the
information component against time to compare the differential timing of signal detection

INTRODUCTION
Advances in antiretroviral therapy (ART), especially the use of highly active antiretroviral
therapy (HAART), have resulted in significant
reductions in morbidity and mortality associated with HIV infection (1-3). As a combination
regimen of three different classes of drugs (nucleoside analog reverse transcriptase inhibitors,
NRTls; nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, NNRTIs; and protease inhibitors),
HAART has the ability to effectively suppress
HIV-1 viral replication (4,5).However, the
treatment is associated with a number of adverse effects that have short-term and long-term
consequences ranging from mild to severe (6).
Adverse reactions were reported in up to 50%
of patients treated with ART, including gastrointestinal, metabolic, neurologic, and dermatologic effects (7). Moreover, some adverse effects
may result in increased morbidity and represent
additional risk factors for future complications
that require treatment interruptions along with
therapeutic drug monitoring for management
(8). Studies have indicated that adverse effects
of ART are a major cause of treatment discon-

and the pattern of signaling over time between
these methods. The ROR and the BCPNN
methods identified the associations between
ART drugs and serious ADRs at the same time.
Both methods were similar in detecting thefirst
signal of a potential ADR. However, the pattern of signaling seems relatively different with
each method. Additional analyses of different
drugs, AD&, and databases will contribute to
increase understanding of methods for postmarketing surveillance using spontaneous reporting system.

tinuation and patient nonadherence, which
may lead to drug resistance and treatment failure (9- 11).Although adverse effects have been
assessed in clinical trials, these trials have several limitations, including small sample size,
short duration of follow-up, and homogeneous
patient populations, which limit opportunities
to identify rare, serious, and long-term adverse
events (12). Spontaneous reporting systems
(SRSs) play a major role in postmarketing safety
surveillance and aim to detect drug safety signals as early as possible in an environment that
is representative of drug use outside of the clinical trial setting.
According to the WHO, a signal is defined as
"reported information on a possible causal relationship between an adverse event and a drug,
of which the relationship is unknown or incompletely documented previously." In SRS, a signal
is a statistical association between a drug and
an adverse drug reaction (ADR) that is considered important to investigate further, and that
may provide new information about an unknown association or additional information
about a previously known association (U,14).
Several statistical methods have been used to

screen and identify a signal in spontaneous reporting databases (15-18). These statistical
methods are based on the measures of disproportionality of reporting, and they detect drugADR pairs that are reported with higher than
expected frequency compared to the background (all ADRs reported with all other drugs
in the database). The most commonly used
methods are the Bayesian confidence propagation neural network (BCPNN), which has been
developed and used by the Uppsala Monitoring
Center in routine pharmacovigilance with its
WHO database (15) and the reporting odds ratio (ROR), which has been applied in the Netherlands Pharmacovigilance Foundation Lareb
(17) and also in Thailand.
In Thailand, SRS has been employed to monitor the safety of all pharmaceutical products in
the market since 1983.The Thai FDA utilizes the
ROR method to screen and detect drug safety
signals from its spontaneous reporting database. Criteria to identify potential signals for
further investigation include the strength of
the statistical association between a drug and
an ADR, consideration of the seriousness of the
event, the quality of reports, and public attention. However, whether ROR is the most suitable method for signal detection in the Thai
FDA database is unknown. The objectives of this
study were to compare signal detection performance of two signal detection methods: ROR
and BCPNN using ADR reports in the Thai FDA
spontaneous reporting database and to describe how the two methods can identify ADR
signals associated with ART drugs with respect
to timing and pattern of signaling over time.

MATERIALS A N D METHODS
The Thai FDA spontaneous reporting database,
which consists of more than 150,000 ADR reports and covers the period 1990 through
2006, was included in the analysis. These reports contain patient demographic information, ADR data, and medication data. Data concerning the ADRs and the drugs are coded
using the WHO-Adverse Reaction Terminology
(WHO-ART) (19) and the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classification system (20),

Bunchuailua et al.

respectively. In the ATC classification system,
the drugs are divided into different groups according to the organ or system on which they
act and their chemical, pharmacological, and
therapeutic properties. ART drugs used for HIV
infection were selected using ATC codes beginning with J05A. Reported drugs specifically suspected of causing the reported ADR were indicated as S (suspected) or I (interacting).
Concomitant drugs were coded as 0 (other).
We considered the ADR when the reported
ADR was marked as a Critical Term in the WHOART dictionary. WHO Critical Term ADRs are
adverse events that suggest a serious disease
state that may be fatal or life-threatening, or
may result in prolonged hospitalization or persistent disability (21).
REPORTING ODDS RATIO
We used the report as the unit of analysis for
calculating ROR. On the basis of case/noncase
analysis, ROR is the product of the exposure
odds among the reported cases of the ADR of
interest with respect to the exposure odds
among the reported noncases (22). The cases
are the reports describing the ADR of interest,
and noncases are all of the other ADR reports
included in the database. The exposure is defined as a report with the ART drug of interest.
The calculation of ROR is based on the 2 x 2
table (Figure 1). The ROR for each drug-ADR
pair and its 95% confidence interval were calculated by:
a/c

For this analysis, we used signal detection criteria of the Thai FDA consisting of ROR > 1, lower limit of 95% CI > 1, and three or more case
reports to identify a possible signal (23).

how the dependencies change with additional
data (15.24). A measure of disproportionality
called the information component (IC) is used
to measure the strength of the quantitative dependency between a drug and an ADR. The IC
value is based on the number of reports with a
particular drug, the number of reports with a
particular ADR, the number of reports with the
specific drug-ADR pair, and the total number of
reports in the database. A positive IC value indicates that a particular drug-ADR pair is reported in the database more frequently than statistically expected from the rest of the reports in
the database, while a negative IC value indicates that the drug-ADR pair is occurring less
frequently than statistically expected in the database. The higher the value of the IC, the more
the drug-ADR pair stands out from the background (24). New data may cause the IC to either increase or decrease. If a positive IC value
increases over time and the confidence interval
narrows, this shows a likelihood of a positive
quantitative association between a drug and an
ADR. The values for the IC and its variance were
calculated according to Bate et al. (15). In
Bayesian statistics we use SDs rather than SEs
since we refer to the posterior distribution of
the parameter and do not refer to parameter estimates. As the IC is the logarithm of the ratio of
the posterior and prior probabilities, it represents the change in probability on addition of
new data. It allows the calculation of the IC as a
distribution, rather than just a point estimate,
based on prior and posterior distributions. We
calculated the standard deviation (SD) for the
IC to assess the criterion for possible signal detection. A possible signal was considered if the

difference between IC and 2'SD (IC-2SD) was
greater than zero (15,24).
COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS
As we were interested in serious ADRs associated with ARV drugs, we evaluated the seriousness of the reactions of all ADRs reported with
ARV in the database and considered only serious reactions. For this analysis, we selected two
serious adverse reaction terms, "lactic acidosis"
and "hepatitis," for consideration as ADRs of interest. Lactic acidosis was chosen as a case
study ADR that represents a specificity of an
ADR associated with an ART drug. For hepatitis,
the ADR was chosen as a representative of an
ADR that can generally be associated with all
drugs. In addition, the related adverse reaction
terms "lactate blood increase" and "hepatitis
toxic" were selected and combined with lactic
acidosis and hepatitis, respectively. Associations between each ART drug and each of the
two ADRs were analyzed using the ROR and
BCPNN methods. ROR with its 95% CI, and IC
with its SD, were computed for ART drugs that
were reported with those ADRs of interest at
quarterly (3-month) time intervals. The signal
detection was performed not only on the suspected (S) or interacting (I) drug-ADR pairs but
also on the concomitant drug-ADR pairs (coded
as 0).Since reported drugs were assessed as being suspected of having caused the reaction, as
interacting drugs, or as concomitant medications according to the health professionals'
opinion on the relationship between the drug
and the reaction, we decided also to include
ART drugs that were reported as concomitant
drugs in this analysis. Moreover, we separately

analyzed drug-ADR pairs reported with combination drug products (eg, GPO-Vir) for each
single drug (ie, stavudine, lamivudine, and nevirapine) when a reported drug was a combination drug product.
We plotted ROR with its 95% CI, and IC with
its IC f 2SD, against time for each drug-ADR
pair to compare the differential timing of signal
identification and the change in values over
time between the two methods.

RESULTS
From January 1990 until December 2006. the
total numbers of reports of lactic acidosisAac-

tate blood increase and hepatitidhepatitis toxic in the database were 94 and 953, respectively.
Of these, 81 of lactic acidosisAactate blood increase and 277 of hepatitidhepatitis toxic were
reported for the ART drugs. The total number of
reports of lactic acidosisAactate blood increase
for all drugs and stavudine in each quarter is
presented in Table 1. For hepatitis/hepatitis
toxic, the total number of reports for all drugs
and nevirapine is presented in Table 2.
Of the reports of lactic acidosisAactate blood
increase, 77 (82%) were reported with stavudine. The first case of lactic acidosisAactate
blood increase with ART drugs was introduced
into the database in the fourth quarter of 2001,
corresponding to a case of stavudine. The development of the association between stavudine
and lactic acidosis is presented in Figures 2 and
3. The first occurrence of signal identification
was in the first quarter of 2002, when three cases of the association were included. At that time
the association was identified by both BCPNN
(IC 1.99; IC k 2SD 0.03 to 3.96) and ROR (ROR
2571.81; 95% CI 264.15 to 25039.84) methods.
For the BCPNN method, the IC value increased
considerably, and the confidence interval decreased over time (Figure 2). The signal was
clearly established as indicated by stabilizing IC
values from the third quarter of 2005, when the
IC was 4.59 (IC-2SD = 4.04) until 2006. In
contrast to the IC value, the ROR value increased from 2001 until the first quarter of
2002 when the association met the signal detection criteria and decreased until the second
quarter of 2003 (Figure 3). The ROR values
fluctuated between 2003 and 2004 and then
decreased continuously until 2006.
Among reports of hepatitidhepatitis toxic in
the database, 244 (26%) were reported in association with nevirapine. The strength of the association over time between nevirapine and
hepatitis is presented in Figures 4 and 5. The
first case of hepatitis/hepatitis toxic with nevirapine was introduced into the database in the
fourth quarter of 2002. In the first quarter of
2003, when the IC-2SD values were above zero
and the lower limit of 95% CI of ROR values
were greater than 1,the association was identi-

fied as a signal by both methods. At that time,
the IC value was 2.32 (IC k 2SD 1.33 to 3.32)
and the ROR value was 10.79 (95% C1 5.26 to
22.13) when eight cases of the association were
included. For the BCPNN, the IC value increased substantially and its confidence interval became narrow (Figure 4). The association
was clearly established as indicated by stabilizing IC values from the third quarter of 2004,
when the IC was 3.82 (IC f 2SD 3.44 to 4.19)
until 2006. Similarly, the ROR value increased
significantly and the 95% CI decreased over
time until the third quarter of 2004 (Figure 5).
Although there were fluctuating values of ROR
between 2004 and 2005, the signal appeared
stable from the first quarter of 2006.

DISCUSSION
This is the first published study of signal detection reporting using the Thai FDA database that
compares two methods of signal detection. We
chose lactic acidosis as a representative of specific ADRs and hepatitis as a representative of
common ADRs for the analysis.
Lactic acidosis is a rare but potentially fatal
complication of NRTl therapy for HIV infection
(25-29). Although all NRTls are associated with
lactic acidosis and hyperlactatemia, people taking stavudine seem to be at greater risk than
people taking other NRTls (28-30). The proposed mechanism for lactic acidosis and other
adverse reactions (eg, myopathy, neuropathy,
pancreatitis, and peripheral lipoatrophy) associated with NRTIs is suggested to be via inhibition of mitochondria1 DNA polymerase gamma,
resulting in impaired synthesis of mitochondrial enzymes that generate ATP by oxidative phosphorylation (6). Lactic acidosis is a recognized
adverse reaction that has been listed on the label of stavudine. However, the US FDA recently
revised the boxed warning label on stavudine as
a result of the increasing number of fatal lactic
acidosis cases (31).
Hepatotoxicity is a general term for liver damage. It includes such conditions as hepatitis,
hepatic necrosis, and hepatic steatosis (32). In
this study, we were interested in detecting signal for hepatitis specifically and not all hepato-

toxicity reactions. Hepatotoxicity can occur
with many medications and has been reported
with many antiretroviral drugs used in HAART.
Among NNRTls, nevirapine is the drug most
frequently associated with hepatotoxicity. The
occurrence of hepatotoxicity was 12.5-17% in
nevirapine-treated patients (33,34). Moreover,
safety warning information about the risk of severe, life-threatening hepatotoxicity, including
hepatitis, has been added to the product labeling for nevirapine (35). Two mechanisms have
been involved in nevirapine-associated hepatitis. The first mechanism is immune-mediated:
the second mechanism (with a delayed onset)
seems to reflect metabolic idiosyncrasy (36,37).
A retrospective analysis of spontaneous ADR
reports in the Thai FDA database showed the

The results support the evidence of risks of lactic acidosis and hepatitis associated with ART
drugs as indicated previously. A spontaneous
reporting system represents an essential and
cost-efficient way of detecting signals that may

refer to unknown association or additional information about a previously known association. However, it cannot be used to establish a
causal association between a drug and an adverse event: associations may be present because the reaction is more frequent or more of-

Although this study showed that both the

detect serious adverse reactions, a generalization cannot be made from this result. Particularly with HIV infection, causal associations be-

tween drugs and adverse events are so often
complicated by the multiplicity of treatments
that any drug might be the cause of toxic effects, and the disease is itself a risk factor for
the adverse event of interest.
We found that, using our criteria for signal
detection, BCPNN and ROR detect serious
known ADRs (lactic acidosis and hepatitis) associated with ART at the same time. There are
limited data on the differential timing of signal
detection when comparing between simple
(ROR) and Bayesian (BCPNN) methods. However, results from previous comparative studies
showed that simple method-proportional reporting ratio generates signals in advance of
Bayesian method multi-item gamma Poisson
shrinker by several years (38,39). This might explain the variation between signal detection
criteria, especially the minimum number of case
reports (cell a in the 2 x 2 table, Figure 1) required for signal identification. The ROR method would detect signals for both serious adverse
reactions, at the first time the drug-ADR pair
was introduced, in advance of BCPNN, regardless of the number of case reports (lower limit
95% CI ROR,,,,i, acidosis = 71, a = 1; lower limit
95% CI RORhepatitin
= 1.l3, a = 2). This means
that if we reduce the minimum number of case
reports, the ROR will be more sensitive than the
BCPNN. On the other hand, it may result in an
increase of false-positive signals.
Regarding pattern of signal development,
BCPNN showed an increase of the IC value over
time for stavudine-lactic acidosis and nevirapine-hepatitis associations as well. As the number of reports of drug-ADR pairs increases, and
as the number of reports of the drug and the
ADR increases, so the CI estimate of the IC decreases. Bate et al. have reported that "the confidence interval estimate of an IC becomes narrow as time passes is the property of all
drug-ADR time scan since the estimation is
based on more reports and the IC stabilizes.
Therefore, a stabilized positive 1C value for
drug-ADR association may imply an ever-increasing likelihood of a true signal as further
reports are added to the database" (15).
Although both the ROR and BCPNN methods

Bunchuailua et al.

identified the initial signals at the same quarter,
the pattern changes over time seem relatively
different with each method. The BCPNN values
increased over time, with decreasing 95% C1,
for both stavudine-lactic acidosis and nevirapine-hepatitis. However, the ROR value increased
over time for the nevirapine-hepatitis association whereas the ROR value for the stavudinelactic acidosis association decreased. The decreasing of the association over time for the
ROR method may be due to the nature of lactic
acidosis, which is rare and more likely specific
to ART. Moreover, when considering the reporting of stavudine, which also is reported with
many other adverse reactions, the association
may also be decreased if another reaction, specific to the drug, is more frequently reported,
thus diluting their association by increasing
the presence of the drug in the noncase reports.
The calculations of ROR and IC in this study
were performed without stratification since we
avoided the presence of any very small strata
due to the limited size of our data set. Although
stratification can be used to reduce confounding, overstratification might lead to decreased
sensitivity (40,41). However, it is possible to
perform the calculation with standard stratification (patient age, patient sex, and time of reporting) for future studies.
Since there is a lack of a gold standard for signal detection in SRS databases, we cannot judge
which disproportionality measure is better (or
worse) than another. Each method has advantages as well as disadvantages. The ROR is a
transparent measure, easy to interpret, and possible for different adjustments in logistic regression analysis (42). ROR is independent of
general underreporting for a specific drug or a
specific ADR (43,44).However, ROR calculation
is impossible when the denominator is zero (eg,
specific ADRs) and results may not be reliable
when small numbers are reported in the 2 x 2
table (Figure 1) (42).The BCPNN method is always applicable and large numbers of calculations can be made efficiently (42).This method
has been recognized to reduce the fluctuations
of disproportionate reporting associated with
low reporting frequency and can protect against

Detection of Adverse Drug Reaction Slgnals

generating multiple false positive signals d u e to
multiple independent comparisons (15,43,44).
As our analysis is based o n the spontaneous
reports, IC a n d ROR values are subject to t h e
biases of such reporting, including confounding by indication, where t h e disease is itself a
risk factor of the event of interest. Channeling
bias occurs when drug therapies within a similar therapeutic class are preferentially prescribed to patients with different levels of disease severity, which may lead them to be
associated with t h e risk of t h e event of interest.
“Innocent bystander” results from t h e detection
of a n apparent association of a drug with a n adverse event that is in fact caused by a frequently
coprescribed therapy (44).
Additionally, a number of factors may influence the reporting of ADRs, such as background knowledge of adverse reactions a n d t h e
drug, health professionals’ attitudes a n d behavior regarding reporting ADRs, public attention
(eg, media, “dear health care provider” letter),
the magnitude of drug use, a n d time t h e drug
has been o n t h e market.

CONCLUSION
In conclusion, we have reported ADR signal detection in t h e Thai FDA database using two
methods. Although t h e methods were similar in
detecting t h e first signal of a potential ADR, the
subsequent patterns of signaling over time were
different. Additional analyses of different drugs,
adverse reactions, a n d databases will contribute
to increased understanding of methods for
postmarketing surveillance using spontaneous
reporting systems.
