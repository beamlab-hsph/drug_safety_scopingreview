Abstract
Purpose Inappropriate medication criteria for the elderly have played an important role in ensuring the safety of medications for the elderly. Too few drugs included in the criteria cannot guarantee the safety of medication for the elderly. Too
many drugs included in the criteria will result in less selective medication for the elderly. This paper uses real-world data
to evaluate the relationship between antihypertensive drugs and falls, so as to provide references for experts and scholars to
revise the criteria of potentially inappropriate medications for the elderly and clinical safe medication.
Method We use the US Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FDA FAERS) to evaluate the association between specific antihypertensive drugs in six categories (alpha-1 receptor blockers (α-1 blockers), calcium channel
blockers (CCBs), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), beta-receptor
blockers (β-blockers), and diuretics) and falls by data mining algorithms, including the reporting odds ratio (ROR), the proportional reporting ratio (PRR), Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), and the empirical Bayes
geometric mean (EBGM) and compared with the relevant drugs included in the Beers Criteria and STOPP/START Criteria.
Result There are a total of 5,157,172 co-occurrences found in 973,447 reports aged 65 years or older from 2016 to 2019 in
the FDA FAERS database, and the number of co-occurrences of falls is 5917 for the six categories of 51 antihypertensive
drugs. Four kinds of mining methods overlap detection of 12 kinds of positive signal drugs, none of which are not included
in the Beers Criteria and 7 drugs are included in the STOPP/START Criteria; 1–3 kinds of mining methods overlap detection
of positive signal drugs, a total of 12 kinds, and one drug is included in the Beers Criteria and 5 drugs are included in the
STOPP/START Criteria; 22 drugs have fall adverse events, but no positive signal is detected, and 13 drugs are included in
STOPP/START Criteria; and 5 drugs have no fall adverse events and 3 drugs are included in the STOPP/START Criteria.
Conclusion The FAERS database was used to confirm the potential connection between some antihypertensive drugs and fall
adverse events through data mining algorithms. The Beers Criteria did not clearly indicate the antihypertensive drugs that
caused falls, and the antihypertensive drugs included in the STOPP/START Criteria were too extensive and did not include
β-blockers and diuretics. It is recommended that experts and scholars use real-world data (such as FAERS, EudraVigilance,
WHO VigiBase, and so on) to further explore the relationship between specific antihypertensive drugs and falls in the elderly,
so as to revise and improve the criteria for inappropriate medications for the elderly.

The incidence of chronic diseases in the elderly, and the
need to take medicine for life, is increasing. Many kinds
of drugs corresponding to many diseases and taking medicine for a long time have made the adverse reactions of the
elderly more and more serious and developed into public
problems [1]. Inappropriate medication use is one of the risk
factors for adverse drug reactions in the elderly [2]. Many
countries have issued potentially inappropriate medication
on standards for the elderly to provide clinical reference. The

American Geriatrics Society Beers Criteria(Beers Criteria)
for potentially inappropriate medication use in older adults
[3] and the University College Cork’s Screening Tool of
Older People’s Prescriptions and Screening Tool to Alert to
Right Treatment Criteria (STOPP/START Criteria) [4] are
widely used by clinicians, educators, researchers, medical
administrators, and regulators. Both are mainly concerned
about the safety of drug use in the elderly. They are based
on literature evidence, using the Delphi validation method to
evaluate the applicability of drugs, reach expert consensus,
and make a list of inappropriate drugs for the elderly.
Hypertension is a common cardiovascular chronic disease. Most elderly hypertensive patients need lifelong
medication, and the inappropriate medications use is more
serious. The evidence linking antihypertensive medications
to fall risk is inconsistent [5–11]. In the USA, falls are the
leading cause of accidental death and the 7th leading cause
of death in people age 65 or over [12]. Falls are associated
with increased morbidity and even death [13].
STOPP/START Criteria indicate that vasodilator drugs
(alpha-1 receptor blockers (α-1 blockers), calcium channel
blockers (CCBs), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors
(ACEIs), angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), long-acting
nitrates, diazoxide, minoxidil, and hydralazine) with persistent postural hypotension may cause falls. Beers Criteria do
not specify the types of cardiovascular drugs that may lead
to falls, but only indicate that α-1 blockers (terazosin, prazosin, and doxazosin) can lead to orthostatic hypotension in
the elderly. Orthostatic hypotension can increase risk of falls
[4]. In this study, like STOPP/START Criteria, we regard the
drugs that can cause orthostatic hypotension in the Beers Criteria as drugs that cause falls.
At present, a number of spontaneous reporting databases
[14] of adverse events have been established internationally,
including the US Food and Drug Administration Adverse
Event Reporting System (FAERS), the European Medicines
Agency’s adverse reaction database (EudraVigilance), and
the World Health Organization’s individual case safety report
database (VigiBase). FAERS was founded in 1969 [15]. It
sets a broad scope for the collection of adverse drug reaction
reports, including not only adverse drug reactions, but also
drug problems under abnormal use, ensuring the comprehensiveness of pharmacovigilance information collection.
At the same time, FAERS also provides a variety of ways
to report adverse reactions, thereby ensuring the richness
and comprehensiveness of the data, and can be effectively
used for post-market safety risk monitoring and evaluation
of drugs. In terms of data acquisition, FAERS provides two
public accesses to the data, which is convenient for users to
inquire in a friendly way, and expands the scope of FAERS
data to the general public. Taking into account factors such
as the size of the database and the availability of data, this
study believes that FAERS has a good representativeness and

13

European Journal of Clinical Pharmacology (2021) 77:1147–1156

is used as a research data source. Regarding the accuracy of
the coding of adverse events, this study chose the terms in the
Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) for
coding. Both the FAERS and the VigiBase use MedDRA as
the standard terminology for their adverse drug event reports.
At present, there are no studies that use real-world data to
verify the two criteria of potentially inappropriate medications in the elderly. In addition, there are few studies on the
relationship between a specific antihypertensive drug and risk
of fall adverse events, mostly on the safety signal of certain
drug classes. Psychotropic drugs can increase the risk of falls
by 50–70%, but evidence of the effect of cardiovascular drugs
on the occurrence of falls remains poor [16].
Therefore, the objective of this study is to use spontaneous adverse events reporting system FDA FAERS to mine
the risk signals between specific antihypertensive drugs in 6
categories (such as α-1 blockers, ACEIs, ARBs, CCBs, betareceptor blockers (β-blockers), and diuretics) and falls. Secondly, we compare the antihypertensive drugs that have risk
signals for falls in this study with the drugs that cause falls
in the Beers Criteria and STOPP/START Criteria to provide
a reference for the expert group to revise the criteria and the
clinical safe medication of medical and health care personnel.

Methods
Data sources
Data from the FAERS quarterly data file database between
January 2016 and December 2019 were downloaded from
the FDA website (https://​www.​fda.​gov/). A dataset consists of 7 data tables, including patient demographic and
administrative information (DEMO), drug/biologic information (DRUG), adverse events (REAC), patient outcomes
(OUTC), report sources (RPSR), drug therapy start and end
dates (THER), and indications for use/diagnosis (INDI).
The drugs in the DRUG table are assigned as any of primary suspect, secondary suspect, concomitant, or interacting. Adverse events in the REAC table are coded using the
preferred terms in the International MedDRA. Reports with
the drug code “Primary Suspect,” “Secondary Suspect,” and
aged over 65 years were included in this analysis.

Definition of drugs
We classified medicines according to the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classification system recommended
by the World Health Organization (WHO). Combination
antihypertensive products were considered in the analysis,
with each antihypertensive ingredient being considered as
an individual drug of interest. Antihypertensive drugs were
classified into the following 6 categories: a-1 blockers, CCBs,

Diuretics

ARBs, ACEIs, β-blockers, and diuretics. Secondly, we screen
specific drugs that are only marketed in the USA as the target
study drugs in this paper. Six categories of 51 target drugs
were identified (Table 1). For the combination antihypertensive product, we do not consider it as a drug of interest.

Definition of adverse events

We processed the data format as one drug for one adverse
reaction, for example, a report with 2 drugs and 3 adverse
events, then 6(2*3) lines of records.
The ROR is defined as

ROR= n11∗n00
n01∗n10
The PRR is defined as

The FAERS database uses the preferred term (PT) of the
MedDRA to encode adverse drug reactions. We use the
online MedDRA browser (MedDRA Version 23.0, https://​
biopor​ tal.b​ ioont​ ology.o​ rg/o​ ntolo​ gies/M
​ EDDRA) to regulate
the PT of the target’s adverse reactions. We extracted reports
of fall using the following PT: fall (PT code: 10,016,173).

Signal detection
R 3.6.3 language is used to mine the drug safety signal.
We mainly used the “PHVID” and “openEBGM” packages
[17] for data mining. The values for PRR (the proportional
reporting ratio), ROR (the reporting odds ratio), MHRA
(Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency),
and EBGM (the empirical Bayes geometric mean) were used
to assess whether a drug is significantly associated with an
adverse event or not. The four signal mining methods are all
based on the disproportionality method. A two-by-two contingency table shows the framework for analysis (Table 2).

PRR= n01∗n1.

The observed-to-expected ratio, n11/n11 (expected), is
used for the calculation of the EBGM. The expected number
of co-occurrences of interest, n11(expected), is defined as

For the ROR [18] and PRR [15], a signal is detected,
if the lower limit of the 95% two-sided confidence interval exceeds 1. For MHRA [19], a signal is detected if the
PRR is 2 or more with an associated 𝜒 2 value of 4 or more.
Finally, for the EBGM [20], the EB05 metric, a lower oneside 90% confidence limit of the EBGM, is used and a signal

benazepril, and lisinopril had reports of fall adverse events,
but no positive risk signals were detected. Fosinopril has no
fall adverse event.
Among the ARB category, the positive risk signals of
irbesartan-fall and candesartan-fall can be detected by four
methods. The risk signal values of valsartan and telmisartan with fall can only be detected by the ROR and PRR
methods.
Among the CCB category, nicardipine and isradipine
can detect fall-positive risk signals by the 4 methods. The
risk signal values of amlodipine with fall can be detected by
MHRA and EBGM. Diltiazem, verapamil, nifedipine, and
felodipine had reports of fall adverse events, but no positive
risk signals were detected; clevidipine and nisoldipine had
no fall adverse event reports.
Among the β-blocker category, the risk signal of acebutololfall, betaxolol-fall, bisoprolol-fall, and nebivolol-fall are relatively strong; it can be detected by the 4 methods. Both ROR and
PRR can detect positive risk signals of fall related to propranolol, timolol, and atenolol. Esmolol had no fall adverse events
reports.
Among the risk signals of diuretic drugs, the positive risk
signal of furosemide and fall is relatively strong. Hydrochlorothiazide and spironolactone can be detected fall positive
risk signals by the ROR, PRR, and EBGM method. Chlorothiazide had no fall adverse event reports.

is detected when the EB05 is greater than or equal to the
threshold value 2. The above 4 methods are based on the
number of co-occurrences greater than or equal to 3.

Results
Basic information on adverse event reports
A total of 5,157,172 co-occurrences were found in 973,447
reports from 2016 to 2019, where a co-occurrence was a
pair of a drug and an adverse drug event. The total numbers
of co-occurrences of α-1 blockers, ACEIs, ARBs, CCBs,
β-blockers, and diuretics are 4115, 50,749, 71,213, 46,923,
68,496, and 82,323, respectively. Among them, the numbers
of co-occurrences with fall adverse event are 46, 875, 1051,
861, 1328, and 1756, respectively. A total of 5917 antihypertensive co-occurrences with fall adverse events was found
in 3294 reports.

Signal detection for specific antihypertensive drugs
with fall from the perspective of drug classification
According to this research signal mining standard, 51 specific
antihypertensive drugs and a total of 24 drugs were excavated
to fall positive risk signals (Fig. 1; Table 3).
α-1 blockers such as prazosin can detect fall-positive risk
signals by the ROR, PRR, and MHRA methods. Terazosin
and doxazosin did not detect fall risk signals.
Among the ACEI category, quinapril is the most strongly
associated with the risk of falls, which can be detected
by 4 methods. In addition, perindopril and ramipril have
detected risk signals by four methods. Captopril, trandolapril,

be only used to detect fall-positive risk signals through the
ROR, PRR, and MHRA method, and no positive signals
doxazosin-fall and terazosin-fall are detected (Fig. 2).
There are 28 kinds of STOPP/START Criteria target study drugs. Among them, 12 kinds of drugs can be
detected with fall-positive risk signals, 13 kinds of drugs
with fall adverse event reports but no positive signals are
detected, and 3 kinds of drugs with no fall adverse event
reports are detected. The positive risk signals of quinapril,
perindopril, ramipril, irbesartan, candesartan, nicardipine,
and isradipine with fall all can be detected by four methods
(Fig. 2).
Target study drugs not included in the two criteria include
β-blockers and diuretics, a total of 23 kinds, of which 12
drugs can detect positive risk signals. Among them, acebutolol, betaxolol, bisoprolol, nebivolol, and furosemide have
the strongest signal of fall adverse events (Fig. 2).

Discussion
We examined 6 categories of potentially fall-risk medications that have been implicated in increasing the risk of falling. Within these broad categories of drugs, some drugs are
more commonly associated with falls. We analyze research
results from the following perspectives, and we put forward
some suggestions to reduce fall.

Beers Criteria: analysis of the detection results
of the target study drug
α‑1 blockers
In the α-1 blockers category, our results suggest that prazosin
has some influence on the risk for falls in old people. This
is not consistent with Cumming et al. [21], who through a

prospective study involving 1358 subjects over 65 years of
age pointed out that there is no potential correlation between
prazosin and repeated falls. However, data mining on α-1
blockers and fall-related adverse events (orthostatic hypotension and dizziness) in the JADER database from April 2004
to September 2016 [22] showed that there is a strong statistical significance between the adverse reactions related to falls
[ROR = 1.63, 95% CI (1.27 ~ 2.09)]. In addition, we searched
FDA@drug, orangebook, and drugs.com database, and the
results showed that the labels of prazosin, terazosin, and doxazosin all have orthostatic hypotension (the order of incidence:
very common (10% or more); common (1–10%); common
(1–10%)); however, all have no fall in their labels. All in all,
based on this study result, it is important to pay more attention
to prazosin which may predict cause of fall risk adverse events.

STOPP/START Criteria: analysis of the detection
results of the target drug
α‑1 blockers
Like the Beers Criteria, the STOPP/START Criteria also
include α-1 blockers, and the analysis results are as above.
ACEIs
Our results suggest that quinapril, ramipril, and perindopril
have a strong influence on the risk for falls in old people.
Captopril, trandolapril, benazepril, and lisinopril have no
positive risk signals. Cumming et al. [21] founded that there
was no association between the use of captopril and the risk
of falling. A prospective observational study was conducted
by Lipsitz et al. [23], which pointed out that ACEIs were
associated with a reduced risk of injurious falls. ACEIs can
maintain cerebral hemodynamics, reduce cerebral blood perfusion, and reduce the development of high-intensity brain
white matter, which is related to abnormal gait and falls [23].
Nine specific drugs have no falls in labels. Whether there is

13

a link between ACEIs and falls still needs further clinical
research. Based on the quantitative statistical results of this
study, it is known that the predictability of quinapril, ramipril, and perindopril causes the elderly to fall.
ARBs
Our results suggest that irbesartan and candesartan have
strong influence on the risk for falls in old people. it is supported by the previous studies of Shuto et al. [24],which
showed that taking candesartan cilexetil in the entire age
group and people younger than 75 years will increase the
risk of falls. Wong et al. [25] showed that elderly people
living in the community taking ARBs have a lower risk of
falls, and studies [26, 27] showed that ARBs are not associated with the risk of falls. In summary, most research results
believe that ARBs do not increase the risk of falling in the
elderly. However, based on the quantitative results of this
study, it is still necessary to pay attention to the risk of candesartan and irbesartan for 65 years old and above.
CCBs
Our results suggest that nicardipine and isradipine have
strong influence on the risk for falls in old people. And
amlodipine was also associated with an increased risk of
falls. But positive risk signals of diltiazem, verapamil,
felodipine, and nifedipine were not detected. Some studies
[23, 25] pointed out that a potential mechanism of calcium
channel blockers involved in preventing falls is by increasing cerebral blood flow and preventing ischemic brain
injury. Our findings are supported by the precious studies of
Cumming et al. [21], which also pointed out that diltiazem,
verapamil, and nifedipine are not potentially associated with
multiple falls. And a prospective study [28] based on a community population showed that there was no statistical significance between diltiazem and repeated falls. In addition,
Fisher et al. [29] adopted a multicenter, case–control study

European Journal of Clinical Pharmacology (2021) 77:1147–1156

involving 119 patients and showed that CCBs are not potentially associated with orthostatic hypotension and falls. A
prospective observational study [23] of 598 people aged
70–97 years showed that calcium channel antagonists can
reduce the risk of falls.

Drugs that are not included in Beers Criteria
and STOPP/START Criteria, but can detect signals
β‑Blockers
Acebutolol, betaxolol, bisoprolol, and nebivolol have a higher
risk signal of adverse reactions related to falls. Both ROR
and PRR can detect a positive risk signal of fall related to
propranolol, timolol, and atenolol, and the risk signal is
weak. Cumming et al. [21] pointed out that atenolol and propranolol are not potentially associated with multiple falls.
β-Receptor blockers can cause dizziness, excessive fatigue,
blurred vision, and bradycardia symptoms, thereby increasing the risk of falls in the elderly. Shuto et al. [24] showed
that elderly patients taking β-blockers experienced 0.34 times
the number of falls as those who did not take β-blockers. Ham
et al. [30] indicated that the use of non-selective β-blockers
is associated with an increased risk of falls. Pindolol and
nadolol have no positive signal with falls. Based on various
research conclusions, further research is still needed to determine the relationship between these drugs and fall.
Diuretics
Among the risk signals of diuretic drugs, the positive risk
signal of furosemide and fall is relatively strong. It is supported by the previous studies of Wells et al. [31], which
found that residents of nursing homes have more than doubled the relative risk of falling within 1 day after starting
or increasing the use of loop diuretics, and Sobel et al. [32]
pointed out that furosemide is potentially associated with
falls. Moreover, the results of a meta-analysis study [33]
showed that loop diuretics were significantly associated with
the risk of falls. Loop diuretics have a fast and powerful
diuretic effect, causing faster changes in extracellular fluid,
which may explain its relationship with the risk of falls.
A large prospective case–control study [24] found that
thiazide compounds are associated with an increased risk
of first falls. In this paper, hydrochlorothiazide and indapamide indicated a positive risk signal of fall adverse events.
The above results of this study are similar. Spironolactone
was potentially associated with falls. Inconsistent with other
research results, a case–control study [29] of elderly people over 80 years of age living in residential care facilities
showed that potassium-sparing diuretics were negatively
correlated with falls.

The ways to reduce adverse events
Falls in the elderly occur frequently and can lead to serious
and sometimes fatal health outcomes. As an aging society
is expected to have an increase in incidence and economic
costs of falls, falls are linked to a variety of factors, including changes in physical and physical functioning, as well as
the use (and abuse) of medications needed to treat a variety
of diseases. The following will discuss how to avoid falls in
elderly patients with hypertension from the following aspects.

Antihypertensive initiation
Butt et al. [34] demonstrated that antihypertensive drug
initiation during the first 45 days of treatment was associated with an increased risk of falls in community-dwelling
elderly. Shimbo et al. [35] indicate that the initiation and
intensification of antihypertensive medication are associated
with a short-term increased risk of a serious fall injury in
older adults. Berry et al. [36] stated that nursing home residents are at an increased risk of falls in the day following a
new prescription or increased dose of a loop diuretic drug.
Extra precautions should be taken immediately following a
loop diuretic drug change in an effort to prevent falls. One
study [27] provides evidence that thiazides are associated
with an increased risk of first falls and that this persists for
at least the first 3 weeks of exposure. Medical professionals
should be aware that starting a new medication can cause
falls. When starting or enhancing antihypertensive medication, they should discuss the short-term risk of falls with
older patients and ways to reduce this risk.

Dose adjustment
Higher doses of antihypertensive medications in older people
aged 60–86 was independently associated with falls, particularly in those with a history of previous stroke [10]. Lipsitz
et al. [23] conducted a 1-year prospective observational study
on falls after collecting baseline data from 598 hypertensive
patients aged 70 to 97 years, and found that the higher the
calcium channel blocker dose, the lower the risk of all falls;
high doses of ACEIs are associated with a significant reduction in the risk of outdoor falls. The effect of adjustment
of antihypertensive medication dose on falls in the elderly
requires further consideration. Health professionals can
reduce the incidence of falls by adjusting the total amount of
medication taken according to the patient’s actual situation.

Polypharmacy
Kaminska et al. [37] stated that the use of a higher number of
drugs, irrespective of their pharmacological group, contributes to a higher number of falls. Kojima et al. [38] stated that

13

1154

geriatric outpatients with polypharmacy were at a high risk
of falls, especially those receiving five or more drugs. Combination therapy may lower pill burden without an increase
in costs; it may also help in the synergistic enhancement of
drug effects and reduction in adverse effects, with positive
influence on safety and tolerability [39, 40]. Health professionals should also be cautious about using multidrug combinations to treat elderly patients with hypertension.

Pharmacist intervention
Pharmacists are members of the patient health care team
uniquely positioned to help assess and address fall risk.
Casteel et al. [41] found pharmacists’ recommendations for
safer alternatives to reduce fall risk without compromising
achievement of desired therapeutic goals. Given that medications are often the cause of falls, regardless of the practice
setting, pharmacists must actively address the risk of falls as
part of a cross-professional team, working with other clinicians to further classify and refer patients to services from the
information gathered in their fall-based assessments.

Individual therapy
Although the guidelines provide a direction for drug selection, individualized treatment is the best option to minimize
the incidence of iatrogenic geriatric syndromes, which are
prone to falls [37, 42]. Choosing specific drugs based on
risk benefits and patient preferences is the best choice for
each older person. Appropriate treatment options should be
considered and selected, such as appropriate treatment for
dizziness and hypertension, rehabilitation of stroke patients,
and avoidance of the side effects of certain medications.

Patients themselves
Patients themselves should learn to recognize any medical
conditions associated with falls and to take safety measures
to reduce the risk. In addition, in order to prevent the effects
of the specific antihypertensive drugs in this study on falls,
optimal levels of functional abilities, such as going outdoors,
should be maintained, and physical exercises, when appropriate, should be done to improve or at least to maintain
muscle strength and safe gait [43].

Computer technology
Xu et al. [44] stated that surface biomedical literature in
conjunction with self-reporting systems (such as FAERS)
can improve drug safety monitoring. Huang et al. [45] stated
that when computer-aided alarm is combined with an electronic prescription tool, it can effectively remind medical
workers to pay attention to the incompatibility of drugs.

13

European Journal of Clinical Pharmacology (2021) 77:1147–1156

Computer-assisted alerts coupled with electronic prescribing tools are a promising approach to lowering the risk of
falls as the use of information technologies expands within
healthcare.
We believe that the data provided in this study will help
elderly patients with hypertension to rationally use drugs and
reduce the risk of falling. Clinicians should be aware of the
drugs associated with the risk of falling when prescribing
drugs, and should consider the balance of risks and benefits
and recommend safer alternatives for drugs with high risk
of falling. Future intervention studies to reduce the efficacy
of drugs in preventing falls are still needed.

Limitations
This study had several limitations. It should be noted that the
signal generated by the quantitative signal detection method
does not represent an inevitable causal connection between
the drug and adverse drug reaction, and it needs to be determined from further clinical drug research and evaluation.
At the same time, some adverse drug reaction reports in
the database are random and biased. Underreporting and
incomplete content will also affect the results.

Conclusions
If the criteria do not include drugs that cause a high risk of
falling, it will cause a greater risk of medication for elderly
patients. However, there are many drugs included in the criteria, including some low-risk drugs, which will reduce the
choice of medication for elderly patients. The Beers Criteria
contain too few cardiovascular hypertension drugs that may
cause falls; the STOPP/START Criteria include too many
drugs, and do not include β-blockers and diuretics. When
expert panels revise the criteria in the future, they can make
some adjustments based on the following aspects.
1. For the 4 kinds of mining method overlap detection of
12 kinds of positive signal drugs (such as quinapril, perindopril, ramipril, perindopril, candesartan, nicardipine,
isradipine, acebutolol, betaxolol, bisoprolol, nebivolol
and furosemide), we suggest it into the Beers Criteria
and STOPP/START Criteria. Remind physicians to pay
attention to the risk of falling when patients take 8 antihypertensive drugs.
2. For the 1–3 kinds of mining method overlap detection
of positive signal drugs, a total of 12 kinds (such as
prazosin, enalapril, valsartan, telmisartan, amlodipine,
propranolol, metoprolol, timolol, atenolol, indapamide hydrochlorothiazide, and spironolactone), we also
suggest it into the Beers Criteria and STOPP/START
Criteria. A list to be studied should be established, and

European Journal of Clinical Pharmacology (2021) 77:1147–1156

experts and scholars should do more research to study
whether the drugs on the list are related to falls.
3. For drugs that were not detected by one or more method,
a total of 27 kinds (such as doxazosin, terazosin, trandolapril, and so on), we do not suggest it into the Beers
Criteria and STOPP/START Criteria. Among them,
clevidipine, nisoldipine, fosinopril, esmolol, and chlorothiazide have no fall adverse event. We searched the
drug labels, and none of them showed any adverse reactions to falls. According to actual conditions, physicians
should use these drugs as much as possible to ensure the
safety and accessibility of medication for elderly hypertensive patients.
The criteria of inappropriate medication use in older
adults have played an extremely important role in ensuring
the safety of medication for the elderly, and its combination with real world data (such as FAERS, EudraVigilance,
VigiBase, and so on) will better improve its guiding role and
ensure the selectivity of medication for elderly patients. The
relationship between antihypertensive drugs and falls also
needs further research.
