Abstract
What is known and Objective.: Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase Tyrosine Kinase
Inhibitors (ALK TKIs) are standard first-­line therapy for non-­small cell lung cancer
patients with ALK rearrangement. Although some cases of hepatotoxicity related to
these drugs have been reported, there is still a lack of investigation on severe hepatotoxicity, such as hepatic failure, with ALK TKIs.
Methods: We evaluated ALK TKI (crizotinib, alectinib, brigatinib, ceritinib and
lorlatinib)-­induced hepatic failure events (AIHFEs), by using the Reporting Odds Ratio
(ROR) and Bayesian Confidence Propagation Neural Network method for mining the
adverse event report signals in the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS)
database from Jan 2013 to Dec 2019.
Results and Discussion: The AIHFEs of “Hepatic failure,” “hepatitis fulminant” and
“hepatic necrosis” were defined as exposure event signals caused by ALK TKIs. The
RORs of “Hepatic failure” were 4.95 (2.36–­10.42) in alectinib, 3.77 (1.69–­8.40) in ceritinib and 2.45 (1.60–­3.76) in crizotinib, respectively. The ROR of “hepatitis fulminant”
was 7.86 (3.52–­17.54) in crizotinib. The Information Component value of “hepatic necrosis” was 1.97 (0.15) in alectinib. In reports of exposure-­event signals, the clinical
outcome of eventual death was common and could occur within 3 months. In the reports of “hepatic failure,” there was no significant difference in the number of reports
between men and women [OR=1.86 (0.94–­3.67), p = 0.09].
What is new and Conclusions.: By mining the adverse event report signals in the
FAERS database, we found the exposure event signals of AIHFEs in ALK TKIs were
“hepatic failure,” “hepatitis fulminant” and “hepatic necrosis”. AIHFEs were more likely
to appear in the reports of ceritinib, crizotinib and alectinib.
