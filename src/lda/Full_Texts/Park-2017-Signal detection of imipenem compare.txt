Purpose: To detect signals of adverse drug events after imipenem treatment using the Korea Institute of Drug Safety & Risk Management-Korea adverse event reporting system database (KIDS-KD).
Materials and Methods: We performed data mining using KIDS-KD, which was constructed using spontaneously reported adverse event (AE) reports between December 1988 and June 2014. We detected signals calculated the proportional reporting ratio,
reporting odds ratio, and information component of imipenem. We defined a signal as any AE that satisfied all three indices. The
signals were compared with drug labels of nine countries.
Results: There were 807582 spontaneous AEs reports in the KIDS-KD. Among those, the number of antibiotics related AEs was
192510; 3382 reports were associated with imipenem. The most common imipenem-associated AE was the drug eruption; 353
times. We calculated the signal by comparing with all other antibiotics and drugs; 58 and 53 signals satisfied the three methods.
We compared the drug labelling information of nine countries, including the USA, the UK, Japan, Italy, Switzerland, Germany,
France, Canada, and South Korea, and discovered that the following signals were currently not included in drug labels: hypokalemia, cardiac arrest, cardiac failure, Parkinson’s syndrome, myocardial infarction, and prostate enlargement. Hypokalemia was an
additional signal compared with all other antibiotics, and the other signals were not different compared with all other antibiotics
and all other drugs.
Conclusion: We detected new signals that were not listed on the drug labels of nine countries. However, further pharmacoepidemiologic research is needed to evaluate the causality of these signals.

Organization Uppsala Monitoring Centre (WHO-UMC) as a
“Reported information on a possible causal relationship between an adverse event (AE) and a drug, the relationship being unknown or incompletely documented previously.”1
Data mining, a signal detection method, uses a spontaneous
reporting system to detect AE signals and has had an important role in pharmacovigilance for the last four decades.2 Physicians, pharmacists and consumers are recommended to report AEs that are suspected to be AEs to a spontaneous reporting system.3 Quantitative analysis methods, such as the
reporting odds ratio (ROR), proportional reporting ratio (PRR),
and Bayesian confidence propagation neural network (BCPNN)
analysis, could reveal important signals by analyzing disproportionately collected reports about drugs and clinical events.4

Imipenem is a member of the carbapenem class of antibiotics. It is known to have a wide spectrum of activity, and therefore, has commonly been used for Gram-positive and -negative, aerobic, and anaerobic bacteria.5 In US Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) drug label information, imipenem presents severe adverse drug reactions (ADRs), such as potential
seizure (0.2%). It also presents common ADRs, such as nausea
(2.0%), vomiting (1.5%), diarrhea (1.8%), rash (0.9%), and so
on.6 The drug label information regarding imipenem ADRs
from the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety (Korea) is similar
to that of the FDA.7 In Korea, however, signal detection associated with imipenem using the Korean spontaneous AEs reporting system database has never been conducted. Therefore,
we first analyzed the Korean spontaneous reporting system
database regarding imipenem and compared it with the drug
label information of 8 other countries to detect signals that are
not currently listed in the labels.

sessment of patient’s underlying disease or medical records are
needed.8

Disproportionality measurement for signal detection
Disproportionality measurement is one of the techniques used
to detect adverse drug event signals, and Netherlands Pharmacovigilance Foundation, the UK Yellow Card database, and
WHO-UMC use this method to find AE signals.10 To make a
2×2 table, we classified rows with imipenem and other drugs,
except imipenem, and categorized columns with specific AEs
and all other AEs (Table 1).
We calculated the PRR, ROR, and information component
(IC) of BCPNN to detect signals. The criteria of signal detection
was a PRR and ROR of at least 2, chi-squared value of at least 4
and 3 or more cases,11 and that for IC was a larger than zero
lower limit of the 95% confidence interval of IC (Table 2).12

Statistical analysis

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Korea Institute of Drug Safety & Risk ManagementKorea adverse event reporting system database
The Korea Institute of Drug Safety & Risk Management-Korea
adverse event reporting system database (KIDS-KD) includes
AE data from December 1988 to June 2014. The data were screened for detection of input error, logical error and assigned
code by drug information and AEs before performing statistical
analysis. This database is managed by KIDS, and anyone authorized by KIDS can use the data, and it is composed of patient information, drug information, AE information, seriousness of AE, reporter information, primary causality assessment,
and disease history. These data have information about suspected AEs coded with the WHO Adverse Reaction Terminology (WHO-ART) codes-Preferred Term level (PT).8 These codes
were developed 30 years ago by the WHO and have been widely used.9 We use the combination of drug ingredients and WHOART PT codes (PT) to find signals. It should be noted that information from the KIDS-KD is reported regardless of causal
relationship. Thus, AE information from other countries and asTable 1. 2×2 for Measures of Disproportionality of Imipenem

We used three methods for signal detection. Nevertheless, there
is no ‘gold standard’ method for signal detection.13 We applied
three methods to target imipenem and all other antibiotics and
drugs. In general, the disproportionality calculating measure
compares imipenem with all other drugs.14,15
A signal was defined when it satisfied all three methods (PRR,
ROR, and IC). We also analyzed the number of AEs reported
from imipenem use, all drugs and all antibiotics per year and
the characteristics of imipenem AE reports. Finally, we compared the drug label informations from South Korea, Canada,
the USA, the UK, Japan, Germany, Switzerland, Italy, and France. All signals have the possibility for disease spill-over
(code of treated disease as ADRs), therefore, we considered the
clinical aspects.16 All statistical analyses were performed using
SAS (Release 9.4, SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC, USA) and Microsoft Excel 2010.

RESULTS
The total number of suspected AE reports to the KIDS-KD from
December 1988 to June 2014 was 807582. During the same
period, the number of AE reports with all antibiotics was 192510
and with imipenem was 3382. The number of reports continued to increase year after year (Table 3).
The characteristics of reports in KIDS-KD are presented in

ing institution (Table 4). All of the characteristics are different
between imipenem and all of the antibiotics, and between imipenem and all of the drugs (p value<0.001). Drug eruption accounted for highest number of AEs reported with imipenem,
353 (10.4%), followed by nausea (207 reports, 6.1%), sepsis (156
reports, 4.6%), and pneumonia (145 reports, 4.3%) (Supplementary Table 1, only online). We calculated imipenem AEs
signals compared with all antibiotics and drugs. Compared
with all antibiotics, the number of signals detected by the PRR
method was 58, 58 by ROR method, 154, and in more than 3
qualified cases by IC method, and 76 by IC method. Compared
to all of the other drugs, the number of signals detected by the
PRR method was 53, 53 by ROR method, 143, and in more than
3 qualified cases by IC method, and 71 by IC method. Finally,
58 and 53 signals satisfied all three methods.
We found imipenem signals, compared with all other antibiotics and drugs, in the KIDS-KD. Additionally, the signals that
satisfied all three indices in the KIDS-KD were compared with
the labels from 9 countries (Table 5 and 6).

DISCUSSION
This study describes signal detections after treatment with imipenem, based on KIDS-KD data. A great deal of research to
https://doi.org/10.3349/ymj.2017.58.3.564

detect individual adverse effects, such as seizure,5,17 digestive
side effects, electrolyte abnormality, and hematopoietic abnormality, including anemia, have been reported.18,19 Babinchak,
et al.20 indicated imipenem-associated cardiovascular system
AEs. In their study, one each case of angina pectoris and left
cardiac failure were reported among 12 imipenem AE cases.
Torres found that cardiac arrest occurred in one patient among
34 patients using imipenem.21 However, cardiac arrest, cardiac
failure, myocardial infarction, Parkinson’s syndrome and prostate enlargement were detected for the first time when the signal detection methods were used. The exact mechanism of
heart disease by imipenem is not clear, but electrolyte exchange,
a known ADR of imipenem, is a significant adjuvant marker of
acute myocardial infarction.22 Furthermore, seizure, a serious
ADR of imipenem, is associated with an increased risk of sudden cardiac death,23 and bradycardia or tachycardia is included in the drug label information in some countries. Therefore,
the ADRs associated with cardiac problems are thought to be
worthy of further study. In the present study, Parkinson’s syndrome and prostate enlargement, which have never been reported, were detected as signals, therefore, further AE studies
are needed to evaluate the causality of this signal.
The number of detected signals by IC was more than detected by the ROR or PRR criteria. This difference mostly results from the minimum number of cases included in the cri-

Signal Detection of Imipenem

teria. Lindquist, et al.24 developed the BCPNN method, which
detected signals with 44% positive predictive values and 85%
negative predictive values, indicating that BCPNN is a valuable tool to find early signals. ADR information was derived
from data obtained from preclinical studies and clinical trials,
however, it may not include rare ADRs, which are caused by
interactions with other existing drugs or ADRs observed after
a long exposure.25 Therefore, observational studies using a
large computerized database for a long time period after marketing should be encouraged.
Our present study employed disproportionality methods
not only to compare imipenem with all other drugs, but also
to compare it with all other antibiotics. We found that the results were different when using disproportionality methods
were used to compare impenem with the same drug class and
all other drugs. Compared with all other antibiotics, signals
detected were more than when compared to all other drugs.
However, since there is the possibility of a false positive, a validity evaluation is required.
This study has the following strengths. First, this study is focused on imipenem, which has been used in more than 26 million patients26 and is a part of the carbapenem family, whose
worldwide usage increased by 40 percent between 2000 and
2010. This is a large increase compared to all other antibiotics
used, which increased by 30 percent during the same period.27
For many complicated bacterial infections, the use of the carbapenem class of antibiotics is considered to be a “last resort”.28 Furthermore, this study is important, since the imipenem-associated adverse effects will likely continue to increase
in the future. Second, this is the first study to analyze imipenem signal detection using the KIDS-KD: this database contains all of the AEs spontaneously reported from December
1988 to June 2014 in Korea.
Like many other studies of AEs using spontaneous reporting systems, our present study has some limitations. First, by
using a spontaneous AE reporting system, the detected signals
may not have a causal relationship. KIDS-KD contains information of causality assessment. However, causality assessment
information of imipenem dealt only 53% and that of all drugs
only 47%. Therefore, it is difficult to evaluate causality of the
KIDS-KD in terms of content or format, and additional pharmacoepidemiologic (PE) studies are needed to evaluate the
causal relationship. Second, the present study has various degrees of underreporting, therefore, the true incidence of signals cannot be estimated.29 Third, delays in reporting and incomplete information are also factors that degrade the quality
of signals from spontaneous reporting systems.30 Fourth, the
WHO-ART codes (PT) and the actual disease may not match.
WHO-ART codes (PT) are selected as the preferred term by
the user.31 For example, symptoms with the same morphological aspect, but different clinical aspects cannot be processed
appropriately by the WHO-ART system.32 Fifth, there is no information about the total number of patients who prescribed

568

the drug. Thus, it is necessary to conduct PE studies, including
a cohort study, considering the actual number of patients who
prescribed the drug.
Early detection of signals is very important to secure patients
for drug safety. Recently, the number of reported AEs in South
Korea has grown explosively. Academies, pharmaceutical companies and institutions need to cooperate actively to effectively
detect signals using the KIDS-KD.
In conclusion, we found signals that have not been mentioned previously. If necessary, a causality assessment is required by conducting well designed PE studies, including a
cohort study, case-control study, or case crossover study. Clinicians and pharmacists are expected to be able to better care
for patients based on the scientific evidence unraveled in
these studies.
