Results | Of the 283 502 patients initiating treatment with infused chemotherapy between 2004 and 2014, patients receiving care in physician offices were older compared with those
receiving care in HOPDs (mean, 54 vs 51 years; P < .001) and
they had a statistically, but not clinically meaningful, lower comorbidity (comorbidity score of zero: 95% in offices vs 94%
in HOPDs; P < .001). The rate of commercially insured patients receiving infused chemotherapy in HOPDs increased
from 6 % of infusions in 2004 to 43% in 2014 (Figure 1).
Spending at the drug level was significantly lower in offices vs in HOPDs ($1466; 95% CI, $1457-$1474 vs $3799; 95%
CI, $3761-$3836; P < .001). Day-level spending was lower for
patients treated in offices ($3502; 95% CI, $3490-$3515 vs
$7973; 95% CI, $7927-$8019; P < .001). Total reimbursement
during the 6-month treatment–episode was also lower in offices ($43 700; 95% CI, $42 885-$44 517 vs $84 660; 95% CI,
$82 969-$86 352; P < .001) (Figure 2). Sensitivity analysis on
breast cancer patients found similar results.
Discussion | Shifting the provision of infused chemotherapy from
physician offices to HOPDs is increasing and is associated with
increased spending for chemotherapy services. The study’s
main limitation is the inability to identify whether the cost differential between physician offices and HOPDs is driven by facility fees. Owing to the limitation of claims data, we were not
able to assess the stage or grade of the cancer diagnosis or to
examine if the stage or grade of the cancer varies between sites.
This study was not able to measure quality of care, which may
vary by site of care. Potential targets for reduction of excess
spending and creation of a more efficient health care system
can come from private insurers following Medicare’s lead,
which has started to equalize payments across sites of care.6

Detecting Chemotherapeutic Skin Adverse Reactions
in Social Health Networks Using Deep Learning
Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) occur in nearly all patients undergoing anticancer therapy, contributing to morbidity, therapy
disruptions, and rising health care costs.1 Their identification
and characterization are hampered by clinical trials that are underpowered to detect rare events, the division of patients across
institutions, patient exclusion from trials, publication editorial delays, and lack of participation and planning in oncology clinical trials of medical disciplines outside of oncology.

Plots show cumulative post count (y-axis) at each date (x-axis) for time-to-detection
analysis. A and B, Papulopustular (acneiform) eruption and nail and finger changes
were first described in association with erlotinib (Tarceva; Genentech) in case
reports published in September 2005 and September 2006, respectively.4,5 Inspire
posts for these reactions appeared 5 and 3 months in advance of publication,
respectively. Collectively, for these epidermal growth factor inhibitor (EGFRi)–
associated reactions and for autoimmune blistering reactions and psoriasis flares

on programmed cell death–1 inhibitor treatment, Inspire forum posts describing these
ADRs preceded initial case reports by an average of 7 months (range, 3-9 months).
C, Twenty-three distinct users described hypohidrosis in a causal relationship with
erlotinib as early as 2006, with a significantly enriched proportional reporting
ratio (1.90), implicating hypohidrosis as a novel, missed, rare ADR. The line at
January 2017 indicates the initial clinical documentation. The vertical line at 2016
shows the last analyzed Inspire content.

Postmarket drug surveillance platforms, such as US Food and
Drug Administration (FDA) monitoring rely on voluntary, spontaneous reporting and lack temporal advantage over literature. Early recognition of ADRs could substantially improve
health outcomes and decrease societal costs. Internet community health forums provide a mechanism for several hundred
million individuals to discuss current health concerns and may
serve as a resource for computational detection of ADRs. However, the language in social media is highly informal, and expressed medical concepts are often nontechnical, descriptive,
and challenging to extract using dictionary-based methods.
Herein, we demonstrate proof-of-principle early detection of chemotherapeutic-associated skin ADRs from social
health networks using a deep learning–based signal genera-

tion pipeline to capture how patients describe cutaneous eruptions in their own words and use statistical methods to quantify the association strength of our target drug-ADR pairs.
Methods | We extracted mentions of common and rare cutaneous ADRs from 8 million posts in the Inspire health forum
(https://www.inspire.com/) related to the epidermal growth
factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitor, erlotinib, or the immune
checkpoint programmed cell death–1 (PD-1) inhibitors,
nivolumab and pembrolizumab.
To detect ADR mentions, we used DeepHealthMiner (DHM),2
a deep learning named entity recognition tool, and mapped extracted mentions to relevant concepts in the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS). To quantify the drug-ADR association

strength, a proportional reporting ratio (PRR) was calculated and
compared with drug-ADR pairs with no known associations to
calibrate the threshold at which the PRR represents true ADR
signal.3 To establish time-to-detection comparisons against literature, we reviewed extractions, excluding noncausal drug-ADR
mentions, and compared the frequency and timing of these detections against published clinical reports. An institutional review
board protocol was not required by Stanford University.
Results | Our system achieved a microaverage precision of 0.90
for named entity recognition of our target ADRs by manual validation. We report the PRR for each target drug-ADR pair and
the distribution of the PRR values for 81 drug-ADR pairs with
negative associations (median, 0.12; mean, 0.2; maximum, 1.4),
which served as experimental negative controls. The PRR for
more than 95% of negative drug-ADR pairs is less than 0.82;
thus, a drug-ADR pair with PRR greater than 1 is likely to be a
true-positive.
To temporally benchmark Inspire content against publications and clinical presentations, we compared causal drug-ADR
mentions of erythematous eruption and nail changes with erlotinib, and psoriasis flares and blistering reactions with immune
checkpoint inhibitors in the Inspire database with first-published
clinical reports. Known ADRs were reported at frequencies comparable with those of published reports but with significantly enriched PRR scores (Table) and an average lead time of 7 months
in advance of literature reporting4,5 (range, 3-9 months) (Figure,
A and B). In addition, we detected 23 novel cases of hypohidrosis in patients receiving erlotinib (Figure, C) with an enriched PRR
score of 1.90, which may represent a rare, missed ADR that has
been present in online discussion for more than 11 years. EGFR
is expressed in sweat glands and is involved in the hypohidrotic
ectodermal dysplasia phenotype,6 suggesting a mechanism by
which EGFR inhibition can produce hypohidrosis.
Discussion | Several hundred million individuals discuss healthrelated issues in online forums, offering a robust resource for drug
safety surveillance.5 Our deep learning pipeline extracts mentions of cutaneous ADRs with high precision from the highly
informal text in social health networks, detecting ADRs with an
average 7-month lead-time from clinical reports. In addition, it
uncovered a novel cutaneous ADR, not previously reported. We
demonstrate the capacity of deep learning–based methods to detect ADRs from online health forums, offering the potential for
real-time pharmacosurveillance with rapid discovery of ADRs
preceding FDA detection and published clinical reports.

Recurrence in Resected Gastroenteropancreatic
Neuroendocrine Tumors
Gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (GEP-NETs) are
widely heterogeneous malignant abnormalities.1 Their natural history is poorly described, with little understanding of recurrence patterns. Surveillance for resected GEP-NETs may include clinical review, laboratory tests, and numerous medical
and nuclear imaging modalities. These modalities can increase patient anxiety, may be associated with potential harm
(eg, exposure to ionizing radiation), and have not been shown
to improve outcomes. Current guidelines vary widely in recommendations, reflecting the lack of data.2,3 Information on the
natural history and recurrence of the disease may improve
patient-centered follow-up of this population. We hypoth(Reprinted) JAMA Oncology April 2018 Volume 4, Number 4
