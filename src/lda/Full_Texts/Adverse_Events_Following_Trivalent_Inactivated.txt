Background: The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices’ recommendations for influenza vaccination of children have expanded from
the long-standing recommendation to vaccinate high-risk children aged ⱖ6
months, to vaccinating all 6- to 23-month-olds (2004), 2- to 4-year-olds
(2006), and 5- to 18-year-olds (2008).
Objective: To identify new or unexpected adverse events (AEs) after
trivalent inactivated vaccine (TIV) in children.
Methods: We analyzed reports after TIV to the Vaccine Adverse Event
Reporting System from 1990 –2006 in children aged 2 to 17 years, and
from the 2008 –2009 influenza season in children aged 5 to 17 years.
Empiric Bayesian data mining techniques were used to identify new or
unexpected AEs during 1990 –2006.
Results: During 1990 –2006, the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System received 2054 reports of children aged 2 to 17 years with a peak in the
2003–2004 influenza season. In 2008 –2009, 506 reports describing 5 to 17
year olds were received. The serious reports of tests performed after TIV
were approximately 10% of all reports from 2001–2006, and 6% of the
reports in the 2008 –2009 season. Data mining showed an increased
proportion of medication errors and Guillain Barré Syndrome (GBS). The
findings of GBS could not be interpreted as causally related to vaccination.
Among 201 reports of medication error, 94% had no AE reported other
than the medication error itself.
Conclusion: In this analysis, we found no unexpected AEs. Our review of
medication error and GBS reports suggests that ongoing monitoring in
these areas is appropriate.

nfluenza virus infection causes substantial morbidity in children
with an attendant need for healthcare utilization, school absenteeism, and secondary illness in families.1– 4 Also, influenza virus
can rarely lead to death5,6 in children with underlying medical
conditions and in children who are otherwise healthy.6
Vaccination against influenza virus is the primary method
for preventing influenza and its complications.7 In 1983, the
Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommended annual trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (TIV) for
children ⱖ6 months of age with certain high-risk conditions.8
Almost 2 decades later, in the 2002–2003 influenza season, ACIP
began encouraging TIV vaccination in healthy children, starting
with those aged 6 to 23 months.9 Vaccination of 6- to 23-monthold children was recommended beginning in the 2004 –2005 influenza season.10 During the 2006 –2007 influenza season, ACIP
recommendations for TIV expanded to include all healthy children
aged 24 to 59 months and their close contacts.11 ACIP again
expanded its recommendation for annual influenza vaccination to
include children aged 5 to 18 years beginning in the 2008 –2009
influenza season.7 In addition, in 2003, Food and Drug Administration approved live-attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) currently for use in 2- to 49-year-old healthy nonpregnant individuals.
Thus, a proportion of the population in this age range is vaccinated
with the newer LAIV.
Studies evaluating TIV safety in children and adults have
found the vaccine to be safe; however, more safety data are
available for adults than for children.12–15 Safety has been assessed
more completely for children aged 6 to 23 months16 –18 than in
older children.
The objective of this review was to analyze reports of the
Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) between
1990 and 2006 and after the new recommendations in older
children in 2008 to identify new or unexpected adverse events
(AEs) after TIV in children aged 24 to 59 months and 5 to 17
years.

METHODS
Data Sources
VAERS is the largest vaccine postmarketing surveillance
database in the United States.19 –22 Since 1990, VAERS has been
operated collaboratively by the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention and the Food and Drug Administration. Serious AEs
reported to VAERS are defined by the Code of Federal Regulations23 as AEs that (according to the reporter) resulted in life-

threatening illness, hospitalization, prolongation of hospitalization,
persistent or significant disability, congenital anomaly/birth defect,
or death. Coding Symbols for Thesaurus of Adverse Reaction
Terms (COSTARTs) were used for coding in the 1990 –2006
timeframe and were used in this portion of our review. There was
a conversion of VAERS coding to the use of the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) in January 2007; therefore, MedDRA coding was used in the analysis of the 2008 –2009
data. The data for the 2 periods were not combined as the coding
dictionaries were not identical. With few exceptions such as
vaccine-associated polio after oral polio vaccine, VAERS cannot
assess whether a vaccination caused an AE, but can identify
possible vaccine safety concerns.24 –29 Note that “seriousness” is a
function, in part, of the judgment of the reporter, that is, if the
reporter considered an event “life threatening,” it is coded as such.
Additionally, events coded as “serious” may be coded with at least
some COSTART/MedDRA terms that may not appear “serious,”
for example, “rash” could have been reported (and therefore
coded) in a person who had a severe AE, including death.
Estimated influenza vaccination coverage data from the
National Health Interview Survey for age and season30 multiplied by the census estimates of the population31 (using the
same age groups and season) determined our estimates of
persons vaccinated.

Analysis
We reviewed all VAERS reports from January 1, 1990 to
June 30, 2006 of children aged 2 to 17 years, and from July 1, 2008
to June 30, 2009 of children 5 to 17 years (age range maintained
to be consistent with the 1990 –2006 review). The initial review
period ended in 2006 to provide a baseline assessment of TIV
safety in this age group before some of the recommendations for
vaccination in this age range changed. The second review period
used different coding terminology. This review was done to
investigate the initial effect of universal immunization in 5 to 17
year olds on reporting patterns in this age group. Children aged 6
to 23 months were not included in this review because they had
been previously studied16,17 and had different concomitant vaccine
exposures than older children. We divided the reports by the
subject age cohorts: 24 to 59 months and 5 to 17 years. TIV
recommendations were not published for universal use in older
healthy children aged 24 to 59 months11 or 5 to 18 years until after
the initial review period ended.7
Influenza seasons were defined from July 1 of the first year
to June 30 of the subsequent year. The date of TIV vaccination was
used to classify each report’s influenza season. Business Objects
software (Business Objects Americas, San Jose, CA) was used to
import data, and JMP (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) statistical package
was used for data analysis (http://www.jmp.com).
We performed an analysis using the COSTART codes in
our review of the 1990 –2006 time period. In some instances, we
grouped several related COSTARTs into diagnostic groupings to
achieve a better descriptive summary. For example, the seizure
group included convulsion, grand mal convulsion, and febrile
seizure. Note that each report can be assigned more than one
COSTART.
We assessed patterns of AEs according to age, influenza
season, gender, and time to onset of AE, and noted whether AEs
followed administration of a single TIV or multiple vaccines. One
of the review physicians/epidemiologists (R.D.M., A.W.M.,
K.R.B., Z.L., and P.H.) performed a detailed review of VAERS
reports and supporting documents for serious cases and those of
special interest.
We used data from the 1990 to 2006 period to perform
Empirical Bayesian data mining (WebVDME Version 5.2, Phase

e2

| www.pidj.com

Forward Inc., Waltham, MA, 2006) on the VAERS database to
identify AEs outside the pattern of those monitored by the authors
for the many years of VAERS surveillance, and to screen for
symptoms or conditions meriting additional clinical review. We
looked for AEs that had a higher proportion among children who
had reportedly received TIV compared with children who had not
reportedly received TIV. Reports in the comparison group excluded children who received TIV, but included those involving
LAIV, licensed in 2003 for use in healthy children aged ⱖ5.34 The
data mining analysis was performed using Empirica Signal software and the Multi-item Gamma Poisson Shrinker (MGPS)35,36
data mining algorithm. The MGPS quantifies reported vaccineevent associations by producing a set of values or scores that
indicate varying strengths of reporting relationships between vaccine and events. These scores, denoted as Empirical Bayes Geometric Mean (EBGM) values, are a measure of disproportionate
reporting of the AE of interest after receipt of the vaccine of
interest compared with other vaccines. These scores are calculated
using an observed to expected ratio using only data in VAERS (ie,
no information on doses administered is used). The observed ratio
is calculated as the number of reports with the AE and vaccine of
interest divided by the total number of reports with the AE of
interest for all vaccines in the analysis. The expected ratio is
calculated as the number of reports for the vaccine of interest
divided by the total number of reports for all the vaccines in the
analysis.33 MGPS adjusts for multiple comparisons and calculates lower and upper 90% confidence limits for the EBGM
values, denoted EB05 and EB95, respectively. The lower-bound
of the Empirical Bayesian 90% confidence interval (EB05)
cutoff of ⱖ2 was used to determine AEs32 that were worthy of
further clinical review.
In this analysis, EBGM values indicate the strength of the
reporting relationship between a particular vaccine and event, as
reported in VAERS. A vaccine-event combination having an EB05
⬎1 indicates 95% confidence that this vaccine-event combination
is reported more commonly than other vaccines and events in the
database. For example, if EB05 ⫽ 2 for a vaccine-event combination, then the vaccine-event occurred 2 times more frequently in
the database than expected when considering other vaccines and
events in VAERS database as the comparator, accounting for
variability in the database and multiple comparisons.

Analysis of Reports of Death
We used death certificates and autopsy reports to determine
both cause of death and the presence of chronic medical conditions. The reviewing physicians accepted the primary cause of
death reported on the death documents: looking first at the autopsy,
if available, then the death certificate, and finally, the VAERS
report itself. Any chronic conditions listed on the death documents
were noted and included in the analysis.

Guillain Barré Syndrome (GBS)
All reports with the COSTART GBS were reviewed and
categorized as verified or not verified. This determination was
based on documentation in the report of GBS diagnosis by a
neurologist, the medical chart review, or follow-up interview (with
a standardized questionnaire administered by, or under the direction of, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention personnel
关available upon request兴). Also, noted was whether the case reported an illness before GBS was diagnosed, defined as any acute
illness reported in the medical record or VAERS report, occurring
in the 3 months before the onset of GBS.

RESULTS
1990 –2006 Summary
Summary of Reports
From January 1, 1990 to June 30, 2006, VAERS received
2054 TIV reports in children aged 2 to 17 years; 819 (40%) reports
were in children 24 to 59 months of age; and 1235 (60%) in
children aged 5 to 17 years (Table 1). The number of reports to
VAERS after TIV increased over time in both age groups, with a
sharp peak in reports during the 2003–2004 season, followed by a
decrease concomitant with the TIV shortage during the 2004 –2005
season (Fig. 1).37,38 The estimated number of TIV vaccinations
was available starting in the 2004 –2005 influenza season. The
estimated number of vaccinations to 24- to 59-month-old children

TIV Safety in Children

approximately doubled from 2,481,771 in 2004 –2005 to 5,325,365
in 2008 –2009. Likewise, the estimates in 5- to 18-year-old children more than doubled from 5,100,647 in 2004 –2005 to
13,525,134 in 2008 –2009. The annual proportion of serious reports following TIV in children varied with the small numbers of
reports received in the early 1990s, but consistently approximated
10% in the years 2001–2006 (Fig. 2). Among all reports, injection
site reactions were the most frequent COSTART or group of
COSTARTs among both age groups (Table 2).

Serious Reports
Among serious reports concerning 24- to 59-month-olds (N ⫽
81), the most frequent COSTARTs were fever (n ⫽ 29), seizure (n ⫽
23), vomiting (n ⫽ 13), laboratory test abnormality (n ⫽ 12), and
cough increased (n ⫽ 8). Among serious reports concerning 5- to
17-year-olds (N ⫽ 148), the 5 most frequent COSTARTs or groups of
COSTARTs were fever (n ⫽ 42), vomiting (n ⫽ 30), headache (n ⫽
22), pain (n ⫽ 19), and seizures (n ⫽ 19).
All 12 children with the AE designated “abnormal laboratory test” had at least 1 clinical AE in addition to the
abnormal laboratory findings. Those AEs included anaphylaxis;
erythema multiforme; a congenitally infected child with HIV
who died; and neurologic, infectious, or renal diagnoses after
TIV. Of the 7 cases with reported AE onset information, all
occurred within 6 weeks of TIV.

Death Reports
There were 15 deaths reported, 10 among children 24 to 59
months of age (10/819 关1.2%兴) and 5 among children 5 to 17 years
of age (5/1235 关0.4%兴) (Table 3). In 14 of 15 of the death reports,
no concomitant vaccines were listed. Of the 13 death reports with
known time to death, the interval ranged from ⬍1 to 15 days after
TIV administration. Of the 11 death reports with a specified cause,
9 reports included underlying chronic medical conditions.

Disproportionality Analysis
We compared the proportion of reports in the VAERS database
from 1990 to 2006 concerning AEs in children aged 2 to 17 years who
received TIV alone versus those in the 2 to 17 year age cohort who

Guillain Barré Syndrome
There were 17 reports coded as GBS; 5 in children of 24 to 59
months of age, and 12 in children of 5 to 17 years. TIV was
administered alone in 15 cases. Eleven of 17 GBS cases were verified
(Table 4). In 6 of 11 verified cases, an elevation of cerebrospinal fluid
protein was documented or an electromyelogram was reported in the
available documents and found to be consistent with GBS. In the
other verified cases, active follow-up documented that a neurologist
had diagnosed GBS. Eight of the 11 verified cases of GBS had a time
to onset of GBS in the first 4 weeks after vaccination, 3 of 11 ⬎6
weeks after vaccination (Table 4). Among the 11 reports of verified
GBS, 6 had information regarding the presence or absence of preceding illness, with 4 reporting nonspecific preceding illnesses and 2 no
preceding illness (Table 4).
Medication Errors
There were 160 (159 nonserious, 1 serious) reports of
medication errors involving children aged 24 to 59 months and 41
(3% of 1235) in children aged 5 to 17 years. Among children aged
24 to 59 months and 5- to 17-year-old children, 96% and 37% of
reports, respectively, were because of use of vaccine outside the
recommended age range for the specific vaccine formulation
administered. Other medication errors included administration of
expired vaccine lots, dosing errors, and administering vaccine with
the incorrect device or route of administration. Among 201 medication error reports, 13 (6%) had an AE reported in addition to the
medication error itself: 6 had injection site reactions, 1 cellulitis, 1
ecchymosis, 1 fainting, 1 upper respiratory infection, 1 fever, 1
pneumonia, and 1 headache with neck pain.

2008 –2009 Summary
A review of the VAERS database from July 1, 2008 to June
30, 2009 for reports of TIV in 5- to 17-year-olds generated a total
of 506 reports. Of these, there were 34 serious reports (6.72%).
Among the serious reports, 35% had other vaccines given on the
same day. The median onset to symptoms of the AE for all serious
cases was 7 days. Six of the serious VAERS reports did not include
medical records.
Highlights of the serious reports follow. There were 2
deaths reported, both with confirmed influenza (autopsy with
culture or immunohistochemical confirmation of influenza virus)
as their cause of death. One death case occurred in a 14-year-old
boy with no medical history, who was diagnosed with influenza
type B with superimposed methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus
aureus pneumonia. The other death case occurred in a 10-year-old
girl with history of ventricular septal defect and patent ductus
arteriosus, who was diagnosed with influenza A. There were 2
reports of GBS and 1 report of infectious polyneuritis (interpreted
by our reviewers as GBS); all diagnosed as GBS by a neurologist
and treated with intravenous immunoglobulin. The intervals between vaccination and onset of symptoms of GBS were 9, 21, and
59 days. All 3 reports had a history within 2 weeks before the onset
of GBS of an intercurrent illness. There were no other vaccines
reported in any of these 3 cases. There were 3 reports of
anaphylaxis; all occurred on the day of vaccination. Two of
these 3 cases received other vaccinations on the day of vaccination and also had an underlying history of asthma. Egg
allergies were not reported in any of these cases. There were 2
reports of new onset nonfebrile seizures. First one was of a
15-year-old boy with no medical history, who also received
hepatitis A vaccine on the same day as TIV; his onset to
symptoms was 7 days. The other report was of a 14-year-old
boy who did not have any accompanying medical records;
however, the report states that he sought medical care for a
seizure on the day of vaccination after receiving TIV alone.

DISCUSSION
The safety of TIV in children is an important issue for
several reasons. In April 2009, the first cases of pandemic (H1N1)
2009 influenza infection were reported in the United States, Mexico, and several other countries.39,40 In July 2009, ACIP recommended that children and young adults aged 6 months through 25
years were a priority population to receive influenza A (H1N1)
2009 monovalent vaccine.41 Second, the United States has expanded its universal pediatric immunization program against seasonal influenza.7
We analyzed the largest US postmarketing surveillance
dataset available on pediatric TIV safety and did not identify any
new or unexpected AEs of concern. Among 2054 reports to
VAERS involving TIV during 1990 –2006, 10% of the reports
were medication errors. Overall, 11% of the 2054 reports were
serious. Interestingly, the proportion of serious reports seen in
2008 –2009 in 5- to 17-year-olds was half that seen in 1990 –2006,
possibly reflecting the healthier population of recipients in the later
period. Overall, this proportion of serious events reported to VAERS
is in the same range as that after other vaccines in younger populations.42,43 A small group of GBS cases after TIV were reported and
confirmed. Among all the TIV reports to VAERS in children aged 2
to 17 years, no new clinically concerning AE clusters were identified
beyond what has been noted on monitoring of the literature on the
safety of influenza vaccine in children to date.18
We observed that more AEs were reported over time in 2to 17-year-old children after the universal immunization recommendations for 6- to 23-month-old infants and children were
published, similar to the observation of McMahon et al.16 These
findings may result from increased rates of vaccination in children,
although some of the relevant data on vaccine coverage are not
available.
Fifteen pediatric deaths following administration of TIV
were reported to VAERS during the 16-year surveillance period,
and 2 during the follow-up period. All deaths reported during the
initial review period were among children with underlying chronic
medical conditions, which may have contributed to their death.
The 2 deaths from the 2008 to 2009 season were apparently in
relatively healthy children who died of influenza. Lack of information precluded detailed analysis of causality, or assessment of
vaccine-associated immunity before death. Although influenza
disease-associated deaths would not be consistently reported to
VAERS, that no such deaths were reported during the unusually
severe influenza season of 2003 to 2004 seems unusual.
In our review, more deaths occurred in children aged 24 to
59 months (N ⫽ 10; 1.2% of reports) than those in children aged
5 to 17 years (N ⫽ 5; 0.4% of reports). This finding is similar to
Silvers et al.44 As TIV was historically only indicated in children
with more complicated medical conditions, the higher number of
children with complicated medical conditions among the childhood TIV deaths might be explained at least in part by confounding by indication.
In our review, seizure was among the top 10 reported
serious AE in both 24- to 59-month- and 5- to 17-year-old
children. Of the 2054 reports from 1990 to 2006, 99 (4.8%) had
seizures noted as an AE after TIV; of these 42 (42.4%) were
serious. A higher proportion of the seizure reports in the 24- to
59-month-old children indicated fever compared with reports in 5to 17-year-old children; this is consistent with a majority of febrile
seizures occurring in this younger age group.45 Our findings are
consistent with an earlier review of VAERS reports in children
aged 6 to 23 months.16 Earlier population-based studies of TIV
using the Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD) found no significant

increase in seizures after vaccination of influenza in children aged
⬍18 years.17,18,46
Anaphylaxis occurs rarely after TIV and may be caused by
allergy to residual egg protein in TIV from the manufacturing
process.47,48 Reports of serious allergic reactions were rare in our
review and none of the 6 children with reported “anaphylaxis”
after TIV reported a history of egg allergy. Although 2 reports
were highly suggestive for anaphylactic reactions, there was not
sufficient data to verify the diagnosis.
Data mining was used as an additional review tool beyond
AE report review to search for potential signals in the VAERS
database. In the data mining analysis, the higher the EBGM score
(and accompanying EB05, EB95 confidence intervals) for a particular vaccine-event, the higher the strength of the association
between that vaccine and event, given the database being analyzed.
Note that this “association” is a result of the disproportional
reporting for various events among all vaccines in the database.
The data discussed here provide an indication of the association of
GBS and Medication Errors with TIV within VAERS. The exact
degree of this association (in all patients exposed to the vaccine
worldwide), however, cannot be elicited from an MGPS data
mining analysis alone, because the association scores (EBGM
values) from such an analysis are generated from VAERS, which
consists of spontaneous AEs reports. An elevated EBGM score for
a particular vaccine-event combination does not prove causality or
an increased relative risk of that vaccine-event. Similarly, the
absence of an elevated EBGM score for a vaccine-event in the
VAERS database cannot be interpreted as a definite lack of
association between that event and vaccine. Finally, reporting and
detection biases can occur in VAERS, and effects of concomitant
illnesses or therapy cannot be fully controlled in data mining
analyses using MGPS. Because of the spontaneous nature of
reporting, the results of this analysis should not be interpreted as a
formal comparison of treatment groups or of their relative risks.
Because the LAIV recipients in the database constituted a small
percentage (⬍1%) of the entire comparison database, the inclusion
of LAIV reports in the data mining comparison group very likely
had little to no effect on the results. The 2 vaccine-event pairs
found in this analysis were fully reviewed in the context of the
VAERS database, and are discussed later.
A considerable proportion of the pediatric TIV VAERS
reports (10%) were associated with medication error reports.
Medication errors were more common in the 24- to 59-month-old
children than the older children (19% vs. 3%). The most common
medication error was administering a vaccine outside the indicated
age range and in most cases no additional AEs were reported. It is
not fully clear as to why medication errors might be disproportionately reported in this age group after TIV as compared with
other vaccines. Similar to our review, an earlier VAERS review
found that reports of medication errors most frequently involved
administration of the wrong vaccine or dosing errors.49 Medication
errors are an increasing public health concern in the era of patient
safety.49 –53 One reason for medication errors after TIV administration in children may be the various licensed formulations of
inactivated influenza vaccine indicated for older children or adults
(allowing for the possibility of inadvertently administering a formulation to an individual of the wrong age). Most (N ⫽ 177, 88%)
of these medication error reports in this TIV review were referred
by the vaccine manufacturer, and the medical setting of the
medication error was not described. However, it is unclear how
representative the VAERS reporting is of the pattern of vaccination errors after administration of TIV. VAERS was not designed
to track medication errors, and so reporting of medication errors to

The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal • Volume 30, Number 1, January 2011

VAERS may be sporadic. Therefore, the data on medication errors
must be considered with caution.
We found 11 verified reports of GBS in the first 16 years
covered by this review, and 3 verified reports from the 2008 to
2009 influenza season. Of the 14 verified reports, 10 occurred
within 6 weeks after receipt of TIV. Seven reported a preceding
illness that could potentially have been a risk factor for developing
GBS, but little detail was given, especially about the intercurrent
illnesses. Although verified cases were validated by a physician,
we cannot state with any certainty that there was a causal relationship with vaccination and GBS in these cases. Moreover, although
GBS signaled in the data mining analysis as a potential concern,
we cannot assess whether there was an increased risk for GBS after
TIV using these VAERS data. This is due, in part, to the lack of
control group, and insufficient information about the number of
vaccinations received over the years of this review. Researchers
have continued to study a possible association between vaccines and
the onset of GBS since the Swine influenza vaccine in 1976 –1977
was found to cause GBS.54 –57 Subsequent studies of seasonal influenza vaccine have found either no increased risk or a small increased
risk for GBS in some seasons (of ⬃1 additional case per million
persons vaccinated).7,27 Relative to other childhood vaccines, clinician awareness of the potential association between influenza
vaccine and GBS might contribute to stimulated reporting for this
condition after influenza vaccines. To the best of our knowledge,
no published population-based studies have adequately assessed
the risk for GBS in children after TIV; however, data from 3 VSD
studies of influenza vaccine safety that included children identified
no signals for GBS.17,18,46 Monitoring and studies continue within
VAERS and the VSD.57 A study of the association of influenza
vaccination and GBS in children would be difficult because of the
low background incidence of GBS in this age group,58 and would
require a large cohort of children over many years to be able to
have the needed power for such a rare event.
There are several limitations to this review. There are
limited denominator data (see Results, 1990 –2006 Summary,
Summary of Reports) and no control group. Passive surveillance
systems such as VAERS are subject to limitations, including
underreporting, unconfirmed diagnoses, and incomplete information in many reports.19 –22 In this review, data mining was used as
a hypothesis generating tool.

CONCLUSION
This review from VAERS found no new or unexpected AEs of
concern associated with TIV among children 2 to 17 years of age. Our
review of medication errors and GBS after TIV suggests that ongoing
monitoring in these areas is appropriate, although the medication
errors were not associated with any severe AEs and the GBS finding
could not be interpreted as causally related to vaccination. Continued
assessment of the safety of TIV and other influenza vaccines is needed
as more children are vaccinated annually.
