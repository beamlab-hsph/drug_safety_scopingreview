This work aims to estimate the degree of adverse drug reactions (ADR) for psychiatric medications from
social media, including Twitter, Reddit, and LiveJournal. Advances in lightning-fast cluster computing was
employed to process large scale data, consisting of 6.4 terabytes of data containing 3.8 billion records
from all the media. Rates of ADR were quantiﬁed using the SIDER database of drugs and side-effects, and
an estimated ADR rate was based on the prevalence of discussion in the social media corpora. Agreement between these measures for a sample of ten popular psychiatric drugs was evaluated using the
Pearson correlation coefﬁcient, r, with values between 0.08 and 0.50. Word2vec, a novel neural learning
framework, was utilized to improve the coverage of variants of ADR terms in the unstructured text by
identifying syntactically or semantically similar terms. Improved correlation coefﬁcients, between 0.29
and 0.59, demonstrates the capability of advanced techniques in machine learning to aid in the discovery
of meaningful patterns from medical data, and social media data, at scale.

• The lexicon derived by word2vec improves the performance of
using social media data to capture the prevalence of ADR.

1. Introduction
Advanced machine learning techniques, especially in natural
language processing, have been employed to estimate the rate of
adverse drug reactions (ADR) from social media [31]. Data of this
type is often informal in nature, for example with lay or slang terms
(for example, “can’t sleep” or “throwing up”), rather than more formal terms (for example, “insomnia” or “vomiting”), which poses
challenges for the task. To account for a variety of expressions of a
single ADR, statistics on the co-occurrence with other terms might
be examined. However, the dimension of the co-occurrence matrix
increases with the size of the vocabulary, demanding increasing
processing requirements. Thus, this approach becomes problematic when dealing with big data. Instead of capturing the global
statistics from data, word2vec [28], a iteration-based framework,
is suitable to suggest similar words at scale.
“You shall know a word by the company it keeps” (John Rupert
Firth, 1957). Indeed, word2vec-like algorithms attempt to realize
this principle, using deep learning approaches to capture relationships between words. In particular, word2vec is a neural network
aiming to either predict surrounding words given a center word

T. Nguyen et al. / International Journal of Medical Informatics 102 (2017) 130–137

(skip-gram model) or to predict a center word given its surrounding
context words (Continuous Bag of Words model – CBOW) [28]. The
resultant weights of the trained neural network become the representation for words in the vocabulary of the input corpus. In this
representation, words are real valued vectors, namely word vectors.
The representation is often called word embedding or distributed
representation.
Word vectors are expected to reﬂect the relationships between
words in the training corpus. Thus in the projected space, the spatial
distance between the word vectors is related to the similarity in the
context between the corresponding words. Speciﬁcally, the smaller
the distance between word vectors, the closer the words are either
in their syntax (for example, “apple” and “apples”) or semantics (for
example, “clothing” and “shirt”).
Furthermore, using the means of vector arithmetic on the word
vectors, one could answer analogous or relational questions, in
form of “a is to b, as c is to ?”. Indeed, the word2vec framework has
been shown to be the state of the art in capturing linguistic regularities, in both semantic and syntactic regularities [29]. For example,
bowl is the answer to “clothing is to shirt as dish is to ?” as the word
vector of bowl is closest to the word vector of (clothing–shirt + dish).
Likewise, the word vector of return is closest to that of (saw – see +
returned).
The ﬁrst aim of this paper is to assess whether the rate of ADR
described in social media documents is related to the known ADR
rate. The second aim is to employ vector arithmetic on word vectors to identify additional terms for ADR, and to determine if this
improves the rate of ADR detected. The current paper is organized
as follows. Section 2 presents the background literature. Section 3
outlines the proposed methods, data, and experimental setup. Section 4 presents the results. Section 5 discusses these results and the
limitations of the work, and Section 6 concludes the paper.
2. Background
2.1. Social media for health care
Social media is a core element of “Social Health” [4]. It has been
integrated into medical practice and has reshaped health care services in several ways. This section highlights certain health care
domains where social media has been utilized in.
2.1.1. Communication
Social media has improved health care quality with better communication between patients and clinicians. Through Facebook
or Twitter, for example, social media provides a novel channel
that quickly disseminates information to a large number of people
virtually and at no cost [7]. For clinicians, there have been several physician-oriented social networking sites, such as Sermo1 .
For patients, an example of a peer-to-peer health care system is
PatientsLikeMe.2 It offers patients an online platform to record and
share health data about themselves through which people might
learn efﬁcient ways to deal with their own disease.
2.1.2. Health surveillance
Social media can be used to effectively build novel disease
surveillance systems that detect, track and respond to infectious
diseases, such as in the case of the 2009 H1N1 Inﬂuenza [6].
Social media could also help reach individuals with mental health
disorders [22]. For example, postings referencing depression symptoms on Facebook were likely to report depression symptoms [30],

131

making Facebook a potential platform for major depressive disorder screening.
2.1.3. Promotional health
Promotional health is another area where social media can be
employed. Effective promotion of healthy behaviors, such as weight
loss programs [33], have been found to be feasible through social
media. Social media is an inexpensive means to deliver behavioral
change messaging and health promotion communications [20]. For
example, Facebook and Twitter were found to be successful platforms to attract and engage a large number of users in sexual health
promotion [34].
2.1.4. Medical intervention
Social media has been used for medical intervention. For example, Facebook was used to treat stress and depression in ﬁrst-year
medical students [12] and a cognitive-behavioral therapy delivered
online incorporated into usual care can improve the treatment of
depression [19].
2.1.5. Medical research
Social media has been utilized in health studies. For example,
it has been leveraged to accelerate recruitment in clinical trials,
leading to a new generation of large-scale clinical research [3]. It is
proven to be feasible to conduct randomized, placebo-controlled,
double-blinded trials entirely via the Internet, providing large pools
of potential participants at reduced cost [17].
2.1.6. Clinical education
Clinicians have found that social media is a novel source of reference materials for medical education. For example, Facebook was
used to deliver an HIV prevention program [7]; or YouTube has
proven effective in many public health teaching programs [18].
2.1.7. Opinion mining for health care services
Social media has been employed for health ratings, aggregating
millions of consumer reviews to ﬁnd the best doctors and hospitals
[14,13]. The online reviews and ratings of patients can be used to
detect health care service quality, alleviating the cost of, or providing a supplemental source to, the traditional, standard survey
approach [14].
2.1.8. Medical marketing
Social media has been used in medical marketing, constituting direct-to-consumer advertising which is a multi-billion-dollar
business [25]. For example, social media was used for clinic branding and practice marketing for plastic surgeons [36].
2.2. Estimating adverse drug reactions from online texts
Social media and other online generated content has been
employed for detecting of adverse drug events. For example, traces
from online information-seeking could help detecting adverse
events of drugs, suggesting a novel way for drug safety surveillance [35]. Other data sources, such as user-generated content in
health forums or posts in health-related social networks, were also
used to extract meaningful knowledge on patient safety [15,8,23].
Another approach is based on an online archive of scientiﬁc articles to automatically detect and validate adverse drug reactions.
Examples include [5,32], where large-scale literature was mined
to identify the adverse effects linked with prescription drugs. To
improve the performance of adverse drug reaction detection, a
fusion of multiple sources of information has been proposed. It
could be a mix of chemical, biological and phenotypic information
for drugs [26] or a combination of signals from ofﬁcial reports, such

as those by the Food and Drug Administration, and electronic health
records [16].
Rather than tracing side effects, other studies attempt to capture customer opinions on drugs from social media data, such as
on the degree of consumer satisfaction (or dissatisfaction) on the
drugs. An example of this is [2] where patient opinions (either positive or negative) from the forum “DiabetesDaily.com” on Sitagliptin
(trade name Januvia), a drug for treatment of type 2 diabetes, were
examined.
In either capturing customer satisfaction or their experience
with adverse events on drugs, a list of seeding words of ADR or
opinions has to be chosen. For example, in [1], the authors examined ADR from online forums for Erlotinib (trade name Tarceva),
a drug for treatment of lung cancer. They chose seeding words
for ADR from the National Library of Medicine’s Medical Subject Heading (MeSH, http://www.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/). Then the list
could be expanded, either manually, for example by looking up
online or ofﬂine dictionaries, or automatically, for example through
using synonym packages such as the Thesaurus Synonym Database
(http://www.language-databases.com/) [2,1].

3. Methodology
3.1. Datasets
Data were collected from three social media platforms: LiveJournal, Reddit, and Twitter. The time span and volume of data collected
is shown in Table 1.

3.1.1. LiveJournal
LiveJournal is a blogging (web-logging) platform founded in
1999, and with over 50 million individual and community-based
blogs.3 A corpus of blog posts was collected using Rich Site Summary (RSS) feeds provided by the authors of [24]. This dataset
contains more than 33 million blog posts written in English by more
than two million users. Over half of the posts also contained tags
indicating the user’s mood, suggesting a sentiment-bearing and less
formal data source.

3.1.2. Reddit
Reddit is a popular forum-based social media platform, and 6%
of all online users are estimated to be Reddit subscribers [11]. Along
with other services, Reddit allows users with common interests to
form or join particular communities of speciﬁc interests, or subreddits. For Reddit, corpora of both posts and follow-up comments
were downloaded, including approximately 200 million posts and
1.6 billion comments.4

3.1.3. Twitter
Twitter is a micro-blog platform used by an estimated 23% of
online users, placing the platform in the top ﬁve most popular social
media sites [10]. We collected a new dataset of tweets written in
English between June 2013 and June 2016. Although the number
of tweets is slightly higher than the number of Reddit comments,
the data volume is signiﬁcantly larger as the meta-data of a tweet
is much richer than that of a Reddit comment. Both sources include
the text content, time-stamp, and author name, while a tweet also
contains information on the social capital of the author, such as
number of friends, number of followers, number of statuses, and
number of favorites.
3.1.4. Known adverse drug reactions
The top ten most frequently prescribed psychiatric drugs were
identiﬁed5 , as shown in Table 2. For each of these drugs, the SIDER
database of drugs and side-effects [21]6 was queried for a list of
known ADR, referred to as the original lexicon or the known lexicon,
and the frequency of each ADR was extracted. Where the frequency
was expressed as a range, the mid-point was used. Fig. 1 shows an
example of the side effect information provided by SIDER7 .
3.2. ADR rates using original lexicon
To establish the ADR rates from the social media data, the corpora of documents were ﬁltered so that only documents containing
the ten psychiatric drugs (either generic or brand name) were
included. The proportion of documents mentioning one of the ADR
in the original lexicon was used as an estimate of the ADR rate. For
each drug, the estimated ADR rate was correlated with the actual
ADR rate from SIDER, and the Pearson correlation coefﬁcient, r, was
calculated. The mean and standard deviation of r across the 10 drugs
was also calculated, as was the mean value of r for each social media
corpus.

3.3. ADR rates using extended lexicon
As lay terms for ADR are more likely to be used than scientiﬁc
terms on social media, we sought to generate an extended lexicon of
ADR terms. The documents which mentioned the psychiatric drugs
were applied to the word2vec model. Skip-gram was used to train
the word vectors as it is better than CBOW in capturing semantics
of words [27]. The dimension of the vectors is 300, matching the
conﬁguration in [27]. The word vectors returned from the model
were the base to search for potential alternative ADR terms. For
each term X1 of the known ADR for drug D1 , potential alternative
ADR terms X2 for drug D2 were retrieved by solving the formula:
D1 + X1 ≈ D2 +X2 . When this extended lexicon is used, documents
mentioning the alternatives will be considered as if they mentioned
the ADR terms the alternatives map to. For example, a document
mentioning “ringing ear” will be seen as it mentions “tinnitus”.
This procedure to estimate ADR is shown in Fig. 2. The correlations

between the ADR rate from the extended lexicon and SIDER were
calculated.

3.4. Computing environment
To extract documents mentioning psychiatric drugs in the big
corpora, Apache Spark, an emerging cluster computing platform,
was employed [38]. Spark is claimed to have better performance
than Hadoop, an implementation of MapReduce [9] – another distributed computing framework, in both interactive analytics, such
as querying large corpora, and iterative jobs, such as optimizing a
function by gradient descent [38,37].
We performed the extraction on a cluster of eight worker
nodes. Each node features a dual eight-core Intel “Xeon” E52670@2.60 GHz processors, 128 gigabytes of main memory, and
the CentOS 7.2 operating system.

these seeds in word embedding representation is used to discover potential ADRs.

4. Results
4.1. ADR rates using original lexicon
Initially, all documents in the social media datasets mentioning
the ten psychiatric drugs were extracted. It took only four hours
and forty minutes for the cluster ﬁltering the documents. Out of
3,782,976,113 documents in the datasets, only 602,799 mentioned
the ten drugs of interest (0.016%). The distribution of documents
by the drugs is shown in Fig. 3, and shows that brand name usage
is substantially more common than the generic name, except for
Desyrel (Fig. 3a). The number of documents mentioning a drug is
strongly correlated with the number of their prescriptions (Fig. 3b),
at r = 0.67.
The frequency of a sample of ten ADR, as stated by SIDER, is
shown in Fig. 4a, and the frequency observed in the social media
documents using the original lexicon is shown in Fig. 4b. The
correlation between estimated and actual ADR rate, including all
241 ADRs, is shown in Fig. 5. The correlation coefﬁcients range
from r = 0.08 (Ativan) to r = 0.50 (for both Cymbalta and Effexor).
The mean correlation coefﬁcient across the ten drugs was r = 0.32
(±0.12).
4.2. ADR rates using extended lexicon
We then derived the extended lexicon using the original lexicon as a seed, and identifying the closest word vectors to the ADR
in the original lexicon. For example, the word vector of “eating disorders” was closest to that of “anorexia”. Similarly, the word vector
of “diarrhea” was very close to that of “diarrhoea”, which is in the
vocabulary of SIDER, reﬂecting the different spelling variants that
may be used. This method did, however, return some noise. For

example, the word closest to “salivation” (the secretion of saliva),
in the word2vec corpus (trained in Section 3.3), was “lacrimation”
(the secretion of tears). In this case, the context word2vec captured
for these two words was not relevant.
To identify additional terms for ADR, in addition to computing
the similarity with the word vectors of ADR in the original lexicon, performing vector arithmetic operations on the word vectors
of ADR and drugs was also conducted. For example, according to
SIDER, “drowsiness” was in top ADR for “Xanax”, thus the formula
of (“Xanax” + “drowsiness” ≈ D + X) was used to identify potential
ADR X for drug D. We found that for some drugs all of top ﬁve of X
are in ADR. In particular, the top ﬁve of X for drugs Prozac, Ativan,
and Zoloft are
• Prozac: sleepiness, loss appetite, insomnia, dry mouth, restlessness
• Ativan: loss appetite, sleepiness, dry mouth, tiredness, sexual
dysfunctions
• Zoloft: sleepiness, restlessness, shakiness, disorientation, loss
coordination.
A projection of embedding vectors for these words is shown in
Fig. 7. As seen, the distance from “Xanax” to “drowsiness” is close
to that of “Zoloft” to “sexual-dysfunctions”. However, for other
drugs, not all of the X are ADR. For example, for Lexapro, the top
ﬁve are “sleepiness”, “insomnia”, “shakiness”, “feel rested”, and
“benadryll”, in which Benadryll is not an ADR but a drug. These
new terms (almost 150) were added to the original lexicon, forming
theextended lexicon.
The frequency of ADR identiﬁed using the extended lexicon is
shown in Fig. 4c, and the correlations with the SIDER rates are
shown in Fig. 5a. Including all ADR, the correlation coefﬁcients

drugs, in relation with the number of their prescriptions.

ranged from r = 0.29 (Xanax) to r = 0.59 (Effexor). The mean correlation coefﬁcient was r = 0.47 (±0.10). In general, for all the drugs, the
estimates derived using the extended lexicon always have higher
correlations than do those derived using the original lexicon (paired
t-test: t = 4.58, p < 0.01). The best improvement is for Ativan, with
an increase of 0.37 correlation, from 0.08 to 0.45, as shown in
Fig. 6.
4.3. Comparison across social media platforms
The correlations between ADR rates, for the original and
extended lexicons, are shown for the individual corpora in Fig. 5b.
Reddit submissions (consisting of posts and comments) more accurately reﬂect the SIDER ADR rate (r = 0.32 and r = 0.46 for the original
and extended lexicons, respectively), followed by LiveJournal posts
(r = 0.30 and r = 0.45), and tweets (r = 0.22 and r = 0.36).
5. Discussion
It was found that across all drugs, in general, the rate of ADR
derived using the extended lexicon (Fig. 4c) is more accurate than
using the original lexicon (Fig. 4b) when compared with the SIDER
rates (Fig. 4a). For example, for “diarrhoea”, the rate of documents
in social media mentioned terms in the extended lexicon, across
the drugs, is 0.78 correlated with the SIDER rate while that of
the original lexicon is only 0.36. The reason might be because the
extended version have higher coverage of expressions people may
use in social media to refer to the same ADR, making the estimate

Fig. 4. The frequency of side effects reported by SIDER and social media. In each
case, an illustrative sample of 10 ADR is shown.

more accurate. For example, in addition to “diarrhoea”, “diarrhea”,
suggested by word2vec, is also counted towards the statistics of
mentioning “diarrhoea”. This methodology could be expanded to
discover new ADR for new drugs. By plugging two drugs a and b
and one known ADR c for drug a to the form of “a is to c as b is to d”,
we would ﬁnd out d, which is an ADR for drug b. For example, given
“drowsiness” is an ADR of “Xanax”, we could discover an adverse
event X for drug D by solving the formula: “Xanax” + “drowsiness”
≈ D + X.
In this work, the degree of mentioning ADR was cast as the proxy
of the prevalence of ADR. In fact, it is not the case for all documents.
In some documents, the same terms were used for the indications of the drugs. For example, “I use Xanax to treat depression”
does not mean that “Xanax causes depression”. Another problem
for the proposed approach is that language characteristics for the

(“Xanax” + “drowsiness” ≈ D + X) into two-dimension space, where drug D is
Prozac, Ativan, and Zoloft. Words in blue are for drugs, in green are for known ADR,
and in red are for potential alternative terms for ADR. E.g., while “loss-appetite”
is not in the original lexicon, it would be an alternative for SIDER’s “decreasedappetite”. (For interpretation of the references to color in this ﬁgure legend, the
reader is referred to the web version of the article.)

6. Conclusion

documents have not been considered. For example, without the
treatment of negation, “Xanax causes insomnia” and “Xanax does
NOT cause insomnia” leads to the same statistics for the prevalence
of “insomnia” for “Xanax”.

This study investigated the potential of applying a novel neural
learning framework, word embedding representation, to estimate
ADR for psychiatric drugs from social media, in comparison with
conventional methods where a ﬁxed lexicon of ADRs is given. The
estimates were compared with the rates in SIDER database, an
ofﬁcial source of drug side-effects. The result indicated that the
quantities derived from the proposed approach had better agreements with the ofﬁcial values. The work also demonstrates the
efﬁciency of advanced computing framework in dealing with big
data, providing prompt reports.
