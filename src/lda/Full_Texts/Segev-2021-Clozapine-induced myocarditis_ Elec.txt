markers and diagnostic accuracy

Background

Results

Clozapine is associated with increased risk of myocarditis.
However, many common side-effects of clozapine overlap with
the clinical manifestations of myocarditis. As a result, there is
uncertainty about which signs, symptoms and investigations are
important in distinguishing myocarditis from benign adverse
effects of clozapine. Clarity on this issue is important, since
missing a diagnosis of myocarditis or discontinuing clozapine
unnecessarily may both have devastating consequences.

Of 254 instances in 228 patients with suspected myocarditis,
11.4% (n = 29 instances) were confirmed as probable myocarditis. Troponin and C-reactive protein (CRP) had excellent diagnostic value (area under the curve 0.975 and 0.896, respectively),
whereas tachycardia was of little diagnostic value. All confirmed
instances occurred within 42 days of clozapine initiation.

Aims
To examine the clinical characteristics of clozapine-induced
myocarditis and to identify which signs and symptoms distinguish true myocarditis from other clozapine adverse effects.
Method
A retrospective analysis of the record database for 247 621
patients was performed. A natural language processing algorithm identified the instances of patients in which myocarditis
was suspected. The anonymised case notes for the patients of
each suspected instance were then manually examined, and
those whose instances were ambiguous were referred for an
independent assessment by up to three cardiologists. Patients
with suspected instances were classified as having confirmed
myocarditis, myocarditis ruled out or undetermined.

Background
Clozapine is the ‘gold-standard’ drug in the management of treatment-resistant schizophrenia (TRS)1,2 defined as inadequate
response to at least two trials of antipsychotic medication of
adequate dose and duration.3 Despite its proven and widely
accepted clinical benefits, clozapine use has been limited by potentially life-threatening side-effects, especially haematological, metabolic and cardiac effects.4 One of the most significant adverse
effects of clozapine is myocarditis.
Clozapine-induced myocarditis (CIM) is clinically and pathologically defined as inflammation of the myocardium as a result
of clozapine administration. Although the pathogenesis of CIM is
not entirely clear, an immune-mediated mechanism responsible
for the inflammation of the myocardium and pericardium5 has
been postulated, given its early onset in clozapine treatment, and
the presence of eosinophilic infiltrates in myocardium.6 A direct
selective cardiotoxic effect of clozapine metabolites owing to
altered metabolism and oxidative stress has also been hypothesised.7
Although the risk of potentially fatal myocarditis with clozapine
is estimated to be as low as 0.015–0.188%.8 Most guidelines recommend vigilance for signs and symptoms of myocarditis during clozapine use, especially during the first weeks of treatment. However,
the clinical features of myocarditis are non-specific and highly variable. The presentation can range from electrocardiogram (ECG)
abnormalities in asymptomatic patients, subtle signs and symptoms
of heart failure such as fatigue, to a severe clinical picture of heart

Conclusions
Suspicion of myocarditis can lead to unnecessary discontinuation of clozapine. The ‘critical period’ for myocarditis emergence is the first 6 weeks, and clinical signs including tachycardia
are of low specificity. Elevated CRP and troponin are the best
markers for the need for further evaluation.

failure with shortness of breath and chest pain, arrhythmia and
sudden cardiac death.9,10 Some patients may not even describe
any symptoms or present with any signs.
The variability of clinical presentation and frequently insidious
onset of symptoms make the true incidence and prevalence of CIM
difficult to determine,11 and benign cases of CIM may go undetected
and remit without the need to stop clozapine treatment.12 Current
studies report a range between 0.2% and 3.4%,5,13 with distinguishably higher rates reported by Australian studies. Some authors have
attributed this variation in incidence rates to better monitoring and
case identification in Australia.12 As preventative measures, current
guidelines suggest a gradual dose titration, serial ECG and a high level
of suspicion for non-specific symptoms of myocarditis (such as
malaise, chest pain, palpitation).14 Avoiding concomitant valproate
use has also been proposed to reduce the risk of developing CIM.15
Aims
Despite being first described over 20 years ago,12,16,17 current
knowledge on the management of CIM has been predominantly
limited to case reports. As such, there is a lack of consensus on managing suspected CIM across published guidelines.18 In addition, in
the context of suspected CIM, the risk–benefit analysis of re-challenging patient on clozapine is very difficult given the paucity of evidence.7,19 The aim of this study was to assess the incidence and
clinical characteristics of CIM in a large comprehensive electronic
health record database.

Method
Sample and setting
The cohort was derived from the South London and Maudsley
(SLaM) NHS Foundation Trust Biomedical Research Centre Case
Register. SLaM is a National Health Service Foundation Trust,
one of the largest mental health organisations in Europe, responsible
for the psychiatric care of over 1.3 million residents in South
London. The electronic health records of SLaM patients are
extracted and extensively de-identified, forming a comprehensive,
anonymised clinical database, named the Clinical Research
Interactive Search (CRIS), fully described elsewhere.20 For this
study, we have included all patients registered in CRIS, having
more than one entry in their case records (as a single-entry record
would disrupt the algorithm). Patient demographics and clinical
data were obtained from both structured fields and free-text fields
in the CRIS medical records. The data was collected from all
notes recorded in CRIS until February 2019.

In the current study, myocarditis status was determined in two
steps. First, instances where myocarditis could confidently be confirmed or refuted were identified. The criteria for this step were
devised by the study cardiologists (T.A.M., S.P.) and instances
were assigned to the three groups: confirmed myocarditis, myocarditis ruled out and ‘undetermined’ as follows.
Confirmed myocarditis

(a) Troponin, echocardiogram/cardiac magnetic resonance (cMR)
and documented cardiological opinion all support the diagnosis, or
(b) positive echocardiogram/cMR and positive troponin test, while
cardiology opinion not done or not documented, or
(c) positive echocardiogram/cMR and supporting cardiology
opinion, while troponin test not done or not documented.
Myocarditis ruled out

Identification of suspected myocarditis
A natural language processing (NLP) algorithm designed to identify
adverse drug events was used to scan the entire CRIS database to
retrieve potential instances of suspected myocarditis (regardless of
clozapine use). The NLP application works by identifying related
words and then assigning each reference as positive or negative
according to the context surrounding the keyword.21 The algorithm
identified patients with potential suspected myocarditis if the case
notes included at least two positive references of ‘myocarditis’.
These criteria were used as it seemed unlikely that a true suspicion
of myocarditis would not be documented more than once in any of
the clinical notes, discharge letters, referrals and summaries.
Anonymised case records were then examined manually by a psychiatrist (A.S.) to ascertain whether myocarditis was indeed suspected.
‘Suspected myocarditis’ was defined when a suspicion was recorded
and any type of clinical action was taken that indicated a suspicion
of myocarditis (i.e. increasing frequency of vital signs monitoring,
ordering an ECG or lab workup, consulting with a cardiologist, discussing cessation and referring to an accident and emergency
department to rule out or diagnose myocarditis). To avoid lack of
adequate clinical information, episodes of myocarditis that has
occurred before presentation to SLaM services were excluded.
Myocarditis definition
Instances of suspected myocarditis were classified into three groups:
(a) confirmed myocarditis, (b) Myocarditis ruled out, and (c)
undetermined. Endomyocardial biopsy is the gold standard for
diagnosing myocarditis, but this procedure is rarely performed or
indicated in clinical practice owing to its significant invasiveness
and low diagnostic yield. In lieu of this, echocardiography and in
particular cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are considered the best non-invasive imaging modalities to aid diagnosis.
However, these investigations may not be available in a timely
fashion to clinicians. Moreover, premature or delayed echocardiograms may not detect the expected anomaly of systolic dysfunction
to diagnose myocarditis. Although cardiac MRI is superior in its
ability to identify the myocardial inflammation regardless of structural abnormalities, it may be challenging for psychiatric patients
who are agitated. Previous studies have thus used an alternative
set of criteria to establish a diagnosis of myocarditis,13 which
enable the use of a combination of clinical symptoms (such as
chest pain), signs (such as fever), lab results (such as troponin or
creatine kinase (CK)) and ECG instead of the gold-standard test.

2

(a) Troponin, echocardiogram/cMR and documented cardiological
opinion all rejecting the diagnosis, or
(b) two of the criteria in (a) refuting the diagnosis, with the third
not done or not documented, or
(c) one or none of the criteria in (a) refuting the diagnosis, with the
other two or three not done or not documented, as well as: all
other tests (ECG, CK, C-reactive protein (CRP), full blood
count) are not suggestive of myocarditis, symptomatology
non-specific (dyspnoea, palpitation, chest pain, shock signs)
and either established alternative diagnosis or clinical team
stopped further workup as myocarditis seemed unlikely
(minimal severity, self-resolution) without cessation of
clozapine.
Myocarditis undetermined

(a) All instances not assigned to either of the two former definitions.
The instances that were ‘undetermined’ by these criteria, were sent
to two independent cardiologists (T.A.M., S.P.), who reviewed the
cases using all information available from the anonymised health
record, and according to the European Society of Cardiology diagnostic criteria for myocarditis.22 instances were re-assigned to either
‘confirmed myocarditis’ or ‘myocarditis ruled out’ groups. instances
that could not be confidently confirmed or ruled out as myocarditis
following cardiology review remained in the third group of
‘undetermined’. Each cardiologist was masked to the other’s decision. Where the two cardiologists did not agree, the details were
sent to a third cardiologist (C.M.P., masked to the previous
rulings) to aid in arbitration.
The troponin test was used to refute the diagnosis only if undertaken within 48 h of the suspicion raised.
Medication data
The electronic health record of each patient who had a suspected
event of myocarditis was reviewed to determine the concurrent
medication regime, including antipsychotics, all other psychiatric
and non-psychiatric medications, as well as the recorded dose.
Clozapine initiation, if relevant, was defined as the first day of clozapine administration. If a patient had more than one course of clozapine, the most recent trial prior to the suspected myocarditis was
considered.

Statistical analysis
A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was performed to evaluate the clinical significance of related clinical measures. The interrater reliability was assessed using Cohen’s kappa
coefficient. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS version 25.

Ethical approval
Ethical approval for the use of CRIS as a research data-set was given
by Oxfordshire Research Ethics Committee C (08/H0606/71) and
the CRIS oversight committee granted permission for this study.

Results
Data were available for 247 621 SLaM patients registered at the
SLaM database between 2007 and February 2019. As illustrated in
Fig. 1, 350 instances of suspected myocarditis were identified by
the NLP application, arising from 324 patients, as 24 patients had
more than one instance of suspected myocarditis.
The average number of positive mentions of myocarditis among
the patients identified was 6.29 (s.d. = 10.11, minimum 2, maximum
127). After manual analysis, suspected myocarditis was identified in
254 instances, from 228 patients. In the remaining 96 instances, the
references to myocarditis were mainly in the context of historical
events (prior to contact with mental health services), describing
family history, mentioned as a possible side-effect or with a low
level of suspicion that did not prompt any clinical action. Of the
254 instances, 241 (94.9%) were prescribed clozapine at the time
of the event, 5 (2.0%) were prescribed other antipsychotics and 8
(3.1%) were not taking antipsychotics at the time of the mentioned
myocarditis.

In total 49 (19.3%) instances were deemed as ‘myocarditis
undetermined’ per the first step of classification (see Methods
section above), and therefore referred to the cardiologists for
review. Cardiologists’ agreement was very good (85.7%) and
kappa score was 0.79, indicating substantial agreement. In all the
seven instances (14.3%) where cardiologists differed in opinion,
the discrepancy included the intermediate category (‘undetermined’). Thus, there were no instances where one cardiologist classified an instance as ‘probable’ myocarditis while the other ruled the
diagnosis out. In all instances where arbitration was needed, the
third cardiologist agreed with one of the two previous cardiologists.
After the two-step classification process, 29 of the 254 suspected
instances (11.4%) were identified as myocarditis and 25 (9.8%)
instances had insufficient information to determine myocarditis.
Myocarditis was ruled out in the remaining 200 (78.7%).
Of the 29 instances confirmed to be myocarditis, attributed to 27
patients, 25 patients were prescribed clozapine at the time of myocarditis, and 2 were not prescribed any antipsychotics. Of the 25 instances
classified as probable myocarditis, attributed to 25 patients, 23 were
prescribed clozapine and 2 were not on any antipsychotics.
The symptoms, signs and lab results of the myocarditis-confirmed
and ruled-out groups are presented in Table 1. In addition, this table
presents the prevalence of previously suggested cut-offs for clozapine
cessation because of myocarditis suspicion: CRP increase over
100 mg/L and troponin increase over twice the normal limit.14
The symptoms, signs and lab results were tested for their sensitivity and specificity. Although almost all measures were more prevalent
in the myocarditis-confirmed group (Fig. 2), most were not sensitive
and not specific. Three measures showed very high sensitivity of
100% – tachycardia, elevated CRP and positive troponin. All others
fell below 65% sensitivity. However, from the three sensitive
markers, only troponin level above the cut-off level had high specificity
(89.1%), whereas tachycardia and CRP were non-specific (9.5% and

45.5%, respectively). The positive predictive values for troponin, CRP
and tachycardia were 50.0%, 29.9% and 12.3%, respectively, and the
negative predictive value for all three was 100%.
Further analysis of these three measures as continuous measures
using a ROC curve analysis (Fig. 3) showed that both troponin and
CRP had very high area under the curve (AUC) values (0.975 and
0.896, respectively), whereas heart rate had a poorer AUC of 0.597.
The two measures previously suggested in the literature, CRP over
100 and troponin over twice the normal limit, differed in their diagnostical properties: although CRP > 100 lacked sensitivity (33.3%), it
had high specificity (96.7%). Troponin over twice the normal limit
was sensitive (83.3%) and maintained high specificity (91.4%).
The time from clozapine initiation to diagnosis of myocarditis
was 2–42 days (mean 17.37, s.d. = 7.41, Fig. 4). Of the 27 patients
prescribed clozapine, 22 were on their first clozapine trial at the
time of myocarditis, and 5 had prior use of clozapine. Of these
five patients, three had previously stopped clozapine because of suspected myocarditis, one because of chest pain and suspected chest
infection and one because of neutropenia. The initial trial of clozapine for these five re-challenged patients was stopped within 45 days
of initiation because of the described adverse events. The mean clozapine dose at the time of myocarditis emergence was 199.5 mg
(25–300 mg, s.d. = 93.3). None of these instances occurred while

undergoing rapid titration, and one occurred during the slow
titration protocol. Only 1 patient (out of the 27 clozapine users)
was administered clozapine only, the others were also prescribed
valproate (n = 6), lithium (n = 3), benzodiazepines (n = 7), selective
serotonin reuptake inhibitors (n = 4), additional antipsychotic (n = 6:
olanzapine n = 2, quetiapine n = 2, amisulpride n = 1, haloperidol
n = 1), mirtazapine (n = 1), metformin (n = 4) and hyoscine (n = 5).
For six patients, data on concomitant medication was not available.
Clozapine was stopped in 35 (18.3%) of instances where myocarditis was suspected but eventually ruled out, and 88.9% (n = 24)
stopped clozapine treatment in the confirmed myocarditis group. In
the remaining 11.1% (n = 3) where the criteria for myocarditis were
met but the clozapine was continued, the medical notes did not indicate any cardiac sequalae during the period in which clozapine was
maintained, nor after it was stopped, and none were discontinued
for cardiac reasons.

confirmed myocarditis and 9.8% had inadequate clinical data to
determine the final diagnosis.
Very few instances of myocarditis were found in patients treated
in SLaM who were not receiving clozapine treatment. This represents a different population of patients, many without psychosis,
not prescribed antipsychotics and living in the community, so any
direct comparison is invalid. Nevertheless, our findings support

the current understanding that the risk of myocarditis is greatly
increased in clozapine users compared with the general population,12 and also compared with patients prescribed antipsychotics
other than clozapine, where there were no confirmed instances.
The principal problem in identifying CIM (and myocarditis in
general) is that signs and symptoms alone are of limited specificity.

An important finding in our study is that the latest instance of
myocarditis was at 42 days from initiation, which correlates with
earlier observations that CIM occurs early in treatment.10
Moreover, all identified instances were in patients either at their
first introduction to clozapine, or whose previous clozapine trial
was both short (<45 days) and terminated because of severe
adverse events. These findings may justify a lower index of suspicion
after 6 weeks of treatment.

symptomatology, including lethargy, tachycardia and dizziness, is
often indistinguishable from common clozapine-induced adverse
effects. This often results in premature cessation of clozapine treatment, before CIM can be diagnosed. In our study, most symptoms,
signs and lab results had low diagnostic value. Three measures
(tachycardia, elevated CRP and raised troponin) had a 100% sensitivity for myocarditis, meaning that all instances with confirmed
myocarditis showed these features. However, tachycardia was not
useful as a diagnostic marker, since it had a low specificity, i.e. a
very high proportion of false positives also had tachycardia. This
finding is consistent with the known high prevalence of tachycardia
in patients prescribed clozapine.23 Only elevated troponin had high
specificity (89.1%). Both elevated troponin and CRP were found to
be good diagnostic measures for myocarditis with a ROC AUC of
0.975 and 0.896, respectively. Based on our results, any increase in
troponin should be a ‘red light’, and even non-severe rises of CRP
might herald myocarditis. As expected, choosing a more extreme
cut-off for troponin of twice the upper limit of normal or CRP >
100 increases specificity, at the cost of sensitivity.

Interpretation of our findings
Our findings demonstrate the clinical utility of troponin levels as a
diagnostic measure when CIM is suspected, particularly before clozapine cessation is considered. From a practical perspective, our
data suggests that troponin levels greater than the upper limit of
normal should warrant clozapine cessation until confirmatory
tests such as an ECG or cMR are performed. To note, these confirmatory tests seem essential: despite relatively high specificity
(89.1%), only half of the instances with troponin greater than
normal were confirmed as myocarditis (positive predictive value
of 50%). Therefore, even a typical event, such as high suspicion
arising within the critical period of 6 weeks and accompanied by
positive troponin (i.e.one that clearly warrants clozapine cessation
until confirmatory test are performed), should not evolve into a
final diagnosis of myocarditis without additional tests and cardiology consultation.
Interestingly, in our study, we found patients that safely continued clozapine treatment despite a diagnosis of CIM. Although continuing clozapine treatment in such circumstances cannot be
supported by available evidence, our findings are consistent with
previous reports that myocarditis can have a self-resolving course
and this is an area that should be explored further in other datasets.22 Although no definitive conclusion can be drawn, our data
may suggest that some patients experience a short, self-remitting
courses of myocarditis, and can continue to benefit from clozapine
therapy.
Previous studies on CIM have reported that inflammatory
markers are predictive of myocarditis and suggested that the prevalence of myocarditis is higher than actually proposed.12 In our
study, patients who had myocarditis ruled out demonstrated a
high prevalence of systemic signs of inflammation such as fever,
malaise, tachycardia and even elevated CRP. However, despite clozapine maintenance in most, this systemic response subsided
without any intervention. Overall, our data suggests that a non-

specific inflammatory response is common when initiating clozapine, and that this inflammatory ‘clozapine storm’, that seems to
occur within the first month of initiation, is not necessarily predictive of myocarditis.
Inflammatory response
The mechanism whereby clozapine increases the risk of myocarditis
is not fully understood, but the evidence that clozapine has immunomodulatory effects is mounting. The effects of clozapine on neutrophil counts are well documented, and there is increasing
recognition of the ‘clozapine storm’ reaction comprising transient
fever and cytokine elevation during the first few weeks of clozapine
treatment.24 A recent study demonstrated that patients treated with
clozapine had lower immunoglobulin levels, suggesting an immunomodulatory effect of clozapine.25 Thus, it appears that clozapine,
for some individuals, invokes a systemic inflammatory response,
that includes myocarditis-like symptoms, or even encompasses a
myocardial–inflammatory response as part of the systemic inflammatory syndrome. Investigation into this ‘clozapine storm’, possible
clozapine-induced systemic inflammatory response, might yield
insights about how to decrease the intensity of inflammatory response
and decrease incidence of myocarditis, and might even shed more
light on the mechanism of therapeutic action of clozapine.

that led to the raised suspicion and evaluation. This might form a
‘tautological’ bias that might boost the diagnostical value of each
parameter. However, as these parameters are the most commonly
used, and the study examined naturalistic setting, it is not expected
to invalidate the results.
When evaluating patients, the study cardiologists had to rely on
data recorded in the files, which were sometimes not definitive.
Although agreement was excellent, 9.8% of the instances could
not be determined and were excluded from the analysis. In the
extreme scenario, i.e. that all the undetermined cases were myocarditis, or all could be ruled out, the overall proportion of suspected
cases that were true myocarditis would be 21.2% or 11.4%, respectively. It is likely that the true figure lies somewhere between these
extremes. If we assume that the proportion of true myocarditis
cases among these undetermined cases is the same as in the remainder of the sample, the proportion of suspected cases who were true
myocarditis would be around 12.5%.
Implications
Overall, our findings demonstrate that myocarditis can be ruled out
in 80–90% of suspected instances, that clinical signs such as tachycardia are not useful discriminators, that elevated troponin or CRP
should raise the index of suspicion, and that myocarditis is rare after
the sixth week of treatment.

Discontinuation
Previous studies showed that concerns about suspected myocarditis
might lead to premature discontinuation of clozapine.7 Our data
supported this observation, showing that in suspected CIM
instances where myocarditis was ruled out, 18.3% nevertheless discontinued clozapine. Current literature has demonstrated that premature discontinuation of clozapine in TRS is often associated with
poor clinical outcomes.26 Existing literature suggests that the monitoring burden of clozapine treatment is a frequent reason for early
discontinuation of clozapine.27 This is likely compounded by a perception of clozapine as a dangerous drug with severe cardiac adverse
effects, which likely explains the frequent discontinuation of clozapine after myocarditis is suspected but not confirmed. Once a suspicion of myocarditis has been raised and clozapine stopped, even
if myocarditis is not confirmed, patients are unlikely to be offered
clozapine again.
Limitations
The knowledge among many clinicians that clozapine is associated
with myocarditis is likely to raise their suspicion of myocarditis in a
patient with non-specific symptoms if that patient is on clozapine
than in a patient treated with a different antipsychotic. This is
likely to have biased this study, which relies on clinician-initiated
investigations, towards overestimating the incidence of myocarditis
in clozapine-treated patients.
The NLP algorithm used to identify instances of myocarditis
required two positive text references to myocarditis, an algorithm
that might not be sensitive enough to have identified all instances
of suspected myocarditis. However, as instances in which myocarditis did occur had significantly more mentions of myocarditis than
those where it was ruled out (mean 10.70, s.d. = 16.77 v. 4.93, s.d.
= 6.31, P < 0.001), it is likely that our NLP search strategy missed
more suspected instances that would have been ruled out, than
true instances of myocarditis, leading to a possible overestimation
of the proportion of suspected myocarditis instances that are confirmed as true myocarditis.
The decision to classify instances as ‘confirmed myocarditis’ was
based on available parameters that can be used to judge the probability for a ‘true’ myocarditis. Often, these were the parameters
