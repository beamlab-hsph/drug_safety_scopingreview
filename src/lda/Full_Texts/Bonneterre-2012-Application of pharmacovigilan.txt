Objectives: The French National Occupational Diseases Surveillance and Prevention Network (RNV3P) is a French network of occupational disease specialists, which collects, in standardised coded reports, all cases where a physician of any specialty, referred
a patient to a university occupational disease centre, to establish the relation between the disease observed and occupational exposures, independently of statutory considerations related to compensation. The objective is to compare the relevance of disproportionality measures, widely used in pharmacovigilance, for the detection of potentially new disease × exposure associations in
RNV3P database (by analogy with the detection of potentially new health event × drug associations in the spontaneous reporting
databases from pharmacovigilance).
Methods: 2001-2009 data from RNV3P are used (81,132 observations leading to 11,627 disease × exposure associations). The
structure of RNV3P database is compared with the ones of pharmacovigilance databases. Seven disproportionality metrics are
tested and their results, notably in terms of ranking the disease × exposure associations, are compared.
Results: RNV3P and pharmacovigilance databases showed similar structure. Frequentist methods (proportional reporting ratio
[PRR], reporting odds ratio [ROR]) and a Bayesian one (known as BCPNN for “Bayesian Confidence Propagation Neural Network”)
show a rather similar behaviour on our data, conversely to other methods (as Poisson). Finally the PRR method was chosen, because more complex methods did not show a greater value with the RNV3P data. Accordingly, a procedure for detecting signals
with PRR method, automatic triage for exclusion of associations already known, and then investigating these signals is suggested.
Conclusion: This procedure may be seen as a first step of hypothesis generation before launching epidemiological and/or experimental studies.

Newly Identified Health Risks (SCENHIR) stated recently
“There are a number of reasons why an emerging issue was
not identified at an appropriate time or its potential effects
were not properly considered.” [1]. The two first - among the 8
“reasons of past failure” identified - are “Inadequate monitoring/surveillance resulting in a failure to detect the presence of
a disease and/or agent at an early stage” and “Failure to make
important relevant information available to the risk assessors/
risk managers”.

from insurances systems, because of their primary vocation of
compensation, are devoted to already known “disease × exposure (D × E)” associations and are not supposed to report and
detect new D × E associations. That’s the reason why occupational diseases (OD) surveillance schemes have been set out by
university physicians and researchers specialists of OD, with
the ambition to take part efficiently to the occupational health
surveillance. Some have developed a systematic collection of
all OD cases by the mean of large samples of physicians from
different specialties reporting continuously or periodically
(surveillance action), as the Health and Occupation Research
Network system does in UK [2-5]. Some rely on a highly qualitative approach consisting of the analysis by OD specialists
(expert function) of the work attributability (imputability) of
disease cases whose work-relatedness has raised questions for
physicians (vigilance action).
“The French National Occupational Diseases Surveillance and Prevention Network (RNV3P)” is a French network
of academic specialists of ODs, which belongs to the last
category. Indeed, RNV3P collects since 2001 in its database,
in standardised coded reports, all cases where a physician of
any specialty, and throughout metropolitan France, referred
a patient to a university OD centre, to establish the relation
between the disease observed and one or several occupational
exposures, independently of statutory considerations related to
compensation [6-8].
One of the research aims of RNV3P is to improve its
ability for early detection of new ODs, especially find out information that could be useful to achieve this objective within
its growing database. In order to achieve this aim, methods
for detecting emerging diseases that are currently used in occupational health and by vigilance systems in other healthcare
fields were first analysed [9]. Most of the data mining methods
used in health surveillance (especially syndromic surveillance)
aimed at identifying unusual increases in the number of cases
within chronological data [10-12]. Beside these methods, we
identified the “disproportionality metrics” used in pharmacovigilance [13,14] as most relevant to our aim of revealing
currently unknown or poorly-documented D × E associations
(“Disease” might stand for “health effect” or “health event”,
and “exposure” for “drug” in the pharmacovigilance context).
Some disproportionality metrics are frequency-based methods (chi2, proportional reporting ratio [PRR] which is used in
the British pharmacovigilance database, reporting odds ratio
[ROR], Yules’ Q), some are based on Poisson’s law (Poisson
and Sequential Probability Ratio Test [SPRT2]), and some rely
on Bayesian methods (as Bayesian Confidence Propagation
Neural Network [BCPNN], which is used in the international

pharmacovigilance database).
In pharmacovigilance, these methods are dedicated to
“hypothesis generation”, also called “signal generation”, where signal stand for “reported information on a possible relationship
between an adverse event and a drug, of which the relationship
is unknown or incompletely documented previously” (World
Health Organization [WHO] definition). These “Safety Data
Mining” methods have shown high potentialities in the analysis
of the very large pharmacovigilance spontaneous reporting
databases (e.g., more than 250,000 reports annually for the
Uppsala Monitoring Centre [UMC] “WHO” database). Retrospective studies have shown that the utilisation of these methods 1) confirmed signals that had been clinically first identified,
2) might highlight these new associations sooner, 3) might distinguish a specific adverse drug effect of a molecule, not shared
by its whole therapeutic family [15]. Conversely we may also
remark that they are few examples of new drug × health effect
that have been first highlighted by these methods prospectively,
probably because, these methods have not been used for such a
long time, but mainly because the analysis of numerous signals
is also time consuming for experts.
We first tested the PRR method on a RNV3P sample few
years ago [16], and the interest of PRR in the RNV3P was also
highlighted in a second publication with twice more data and
the example of systemic sclerosis [8].
The objectives of this paper are to present the comparison of the seven previously cited pharmacovigilance methods
tested on RNV3P, in order to choose the most promising
method(s), and then propose a procedure for an utilisation of
these method(s) on a routine basis in the RNV3P network.

Materials and Methods
Data
RNV3P data from 2001-2009 were analysed, including a total
of 81,132 observations. The main codes used are International
Classification of Diseases 10th Revision (ICD-10), International Standard Classification of Occupations (ISCO 88), Nomenclature d’Activités Françaises for activity sector (NAF 93), and
a French code for exposures from the French national insurance system of salaried workers (CNAM-TS), at the origin of
the European Occupational Diseases Statistics Classification of
the causal agents of the ODs (EODS causal agents code). This
last code may be downloaded on the following EU website:
http://circa.europa.eu/Public/irc/dsis/hasaw/library?l=/occupational_statisstics/working_paper_18/_EN_1.0_
One key point of RNV3P data is that 75% of the observations notify only one exposure (17% with 2 exposures, 5% with

son of the behaviours of the methods, notably of the ranking
of the disproportionality measure affected to the D × E associations.

Methods
Pharmacovigilance methods are detailed in several publications, where especially formula and signal generation criteria
may be found [17,18]. At the first level, each report generates n
“D × E associations”, n being the number of exposures notified
in this report notifying one disease. At the aggregated level (the
whole database being taken into account), the observed number
of cases of each “D × E association” is compared with the estimation of the expected number of cases. This expected number
of cases is calculated using data from the database only, reason
why these methods are also named “numerator dependent”.
Pharmacovigilance methods generate a statistical signal when
there is a discrepancy between the observed number of a D ×
E association within the database and the expected number of
cases. Several methods are proposed to estimate the magnitude
of the disproportion measure and its confidence interval. All
are derived from a basic 2 × 2 contingence table generated for
each D × E pair [16]. In other words, these methods are using
the “background noise” summarized in the marginal counts of
these 2 × 2 contingency tables.
Seven disproportionality metrics were applied and their
results compared: the usual, frequency-based methods (n°1:
PRR which is used in the British pharmacovigilance database,
n°2: ROR, n°3: Yules, n°4: chi2), methods based on Poisson’s
law (n°5: Poisson and n°6 : SPRT2), as well as one of the
two Bayesian methods that have been described to date (n°7:
BCPNN), which is used by the WHO collaborative centre on
pharmacovigilance (UMC) on the international pharmacovigilance database. Only the Empirical Bayes Screening (EBS)
method, also named “Dumouchel method”, was not tested, as
it was more complex to implement.
Another point that should be kept in mind is that the same
method may be used with different signal generation criteria.
For instance there are two common PRR signal generation
criteria for PRR method. The first one is a composite criterion
requiring that the number of observed cases (a) is at least equal
to 3, and that PRR and chi2 measures for this association are at
least equal to 2 and 4 respectively: a ≥ 3 and PRR ≥ 2 and chi2
≥ 4 (named “PRR1” in Table 1). The second is that the lower
bound of its 95% confidence interval has to exceeded one: LI95%
(PRR) > 1 (named “PRR2” in Table 1).
The comparison of the methods can’t be done with sensitivity and specificity assessment, due to the absence of a Gold
Standard allowing differentiating true positives (health events
with causality relation to the notified exposure) from false positives (see Discussion). For that reason, we propose a compari-

Results
Structure of the D × E database
The 81,132 observations lead to 11,627 “D × E” associations.
The filling percentage of the theoretical “D × E” matrix is of
1.2%, which is not so different from pharmacovigilance databases (e.g., 2.1% for the US Medwatch database in 2002 [19]),
or 2.2% to 3.6% for the WHO Vigibase in 2005, according to
the level of information (code precision) taken into account
(personal communication with UMC). Most of the cases are
reported once (63% of the associations). Four thousands and
two hundreds ninety one D × E associations were reported
more than twice and are potentially candidate for generating
a signal. The distribution of the D × E associations, according
to their number of observations (Fig. 1), is similar to the one
of the French pharmacovigilance database. This shows a good
comparability of RNV3P D × E matrix and the health event ×
drug matrix of the pharmacovigilance databases, according to
their sparsity (“empty matrixes”) and to the distribution of the
size of theses associations. The main difference is that RVN3P
database is built on a smaller number of cases. The distribution
is also similar for the RNV3P “disease × occupation” and “dis-

When associations are plotted near the bisecting line, a similar rank has been affected by the 2 disproportionality metrics compared. Conversely,
when some associations are plotted lower (respectively higher) than the bisecting line, it means that they have been affected lower (respectively
higher) disproportionality measures by the method represented on the y axis, than by the PRR method.

ods with their usual signal generation criterion, and if these
signals concern potentially compensable diseases or not (because the potentially new OD belongs to the second category,
the signals belonging to the first category will not have to be
investigated). In terms of number of signal generated, we
can distinguish two groups of methods. PRR2, ROR, Yules,
BCPNN and chi2 generate a signal for 21 to 23% of the D × E
associations, and only the 12-14% not eligible for compensation
would deserve investigation. This percentage rises up to 58%
to 66%, if we consider only the associations reported twice or
more. PRR1 and SPRT2 are more “restrictive”, as respectively
11% and 8% of all associations generate a signal (6% and 3%
of associations not eligible for compensation would deserve
investigation). Poisson method with its common signal generation criteria generates a signal for up to 25% of all associations.
Table 1 also presents a quantitative assessment of the overlap
of the signals generated by each method with the signals generated by PRR1 and PRR2 taken as references.

Comparison of disproportionality metrics with
regards to their respective ranking of all D × E
associations
The differences between PRR2 and the other methods might be
understood when comparing the respective ranking of the D ×
E association by the different methods. This analysis shows
that the behaviour of the 7 metrics is different according to the
number of cases reported for each D × E association. This is
illustrated by Fig. 2, which displays the rank of each D × E as-

twice or more, their number of reports, their measures with BCPNN
method, whether they generate a signal (solid triangles) or not (empty
triangles), and overlap with proportional reporting ratio signals (PRR1

sociation according to PRR2, as a reference (x axis), compared
to the rank of this association with other methods successively
(y axis), highlighting in the same time (symbols) the number of
reports for each D × E association. This figure shows the slight
similar behaviours of PRR2 with the other frequentist method
ROR, and its derivative Yules (which rank similarly the associations). We also notice only a very slight difference between
PRR2 and BCPNN: BCPNN may give a slightly superior rank
to associations with a low number of associations, whereas the
“frequentist” method PRR2 is more “sensitive” to the highest
number of reports. To the contrary, there are big differences in
terms of ranking when considering PRR in one hand, and chi2,
SPRT2 or Poisson to the other. For example, chi2 ranking distribution is biphasic with regards to PRR2, as it is very sensitive
to D × E associations reported a high number of times, and at
the same time sensitive to associations reported a low number
of times, when this number is equal or nearly equal to the marginal count of the exposure or of the disease.
Finally, the relatively similar behaviour of PRR2 and
BCPNN, despite their different theoretical backgrounds, is illustrated with the example of the systemic sclerosis (ICD-10:
M34). One hundred seventy eight observations reported M34
as a main Diagnosis on 2001-2009 data. These data lead to 70
associations “M34 × exposure”, of which 27 associations are
reported more than twice. The ranking of the BCPNN measures of these “M34 × E associations”, and the overlap with
the signals generated by PRR1 and PRR2 are presented (Fig.
3). Difference in signal generation between BCPNN and PRR2
only concerns one association (which is just exceeding the

BCPNN signal threshold), and differences with PRR1 only concern the associations reported only twice. Furthermore, their
ranking of the highest signals is similar (Fig. 4).

Discussion
In this work, 7 disproportionality metrics used in pharmacovigilance to highlight potential new “drugs × health events”
associations were tested on RNV3P database to assess their
relevance for detecting new “exposure × health events”. Their
results, in terms of number of signals generated and signal
ranking were compared, and an illustration was given with
the disease Systemic Scleroderma. This was a first step before
choosing the most promising method(s), and proposing a procedure for an utilisation of these method(s) on a routine basis
in the RNV3P network.

Choice of a method in the light of the comparisons
made between these disproportionality metrics in
this work and in the literature
Considering the above mentioned comparisons, and many
examples accurately studied (notably the temporal trend of the
signal), the PRR method was finally chosen for integration in
a wider procedure of screening of RNV3P database, because
more complex methods did not show a greater value with the
RNV3P data. As discussed in the literature, the price of sophistication is these methods is the “increased cost of lack of transparency” [15], which seems so far not justified in our context.
There are few data in the literature about comparison of
these methods, because, in the absence of a Gold Standard allowing differentiating true positives (health events with causality relation) from false positives, it is difficult to calculate their
respective sensitivity and specificity. That’s why, the estimations
of sensitivity and specificity often rely on simulated data [17].
When considering all the D × E association generating a signal
with their simulated data, the authors did not show many differences in specificity according to the methods, and slight differences in terms of sensitivity. When taking into account the
ranking of all signals, they showed a less rate of false positives
of BCPNN and EBS, but this superiority to frequentist methods disappeared soon when increasing the number of the most
highly ranked combination taken into account, and when the
number of observed cases is increasing (no more differences
for associations reported at least 5 times). Finally they showed
that all methods had a better performance, when ranking was
done on the lower bound of their confidence interval that takes
into account the variance of the disproportionality measure.
We should nevertheless remember that these estimations of

sensitivity and specificity remain relatives to the structure of
the dataset they were tested on. That’s the reason why, on other
studies, PRR may have shown superiority in some contexts [20].
As Hauben and Bate [15] said, “Judicious implementation of
all the methods gives comparable results and far greater variation in performance is seen owing to heterogeneity in implementation choices, such as threshold election/titration and the
triage logic and procedures for investigation of signals”. In the
light of this comment, we could analyse the added value, for our
purpose of some sophistications as the weighting of some D ×
E associations to allow them generate a signal sooner if they
appear (e.g., if there has been suspicion due to experimental
toxicological data, Quantitative Structure Activity Relationships [QSARs], or even clinical sentinel approach). Conversely,
stratification according to age, sex or other variables is not yet
relevant, as the number of cases per associations is already low
(it would prevent many D × E associations to reach statistical
significance).

Proposed procedure for the routine use in RNV3P
Accordingly, a procedure for detecting signals with PRR method, and then investigating these signals has been suggested:
1) detection of signals using the PRR method; 2) automatic
sorting and elimination of signals generated that can lead to
recognition of an OD as they reflect known associations; 3)
investigation of each as yet unknown D × E association generating a signal, by investigating data within the database (number
and source of cases, changes over time of the signal, distribution of the attributabilities assessed by the OD specialists, etc); 4)
analysis of data in the literature using an algorithm explaining
the level of proof from, on one hand human data (epidemiology and case reports), and to the other hand experimental data
(toxicology), and using Bradford-Hill causality criteria. This
procedure should be used in the next future on a routine basis, as soon as the new RNV3P information system-currently
tested-will allow welcoming a complementary analysis module.

Interest and limits of this procedure
We think this procedure including disproportionality metrics
represent an interesting supplemental quantitative tool that can
be helpful to highlight some potentially emerging D × E associations which should require attention and specific investigations (cf. examples listed in the previous publications [8,16]).
Yet, it is important to remember that these methods are
only the first step in a more comprehensive process, which
requires evaluation of the relevance of the signals generated,
and monitoring of such signals (“signal strengthening”, “signal
follow-up”). These methods are not able to demonstrate causal-

ity. They may be seen as a first step of hypothesis generation
before launching epidemiological and/or experimental studies.
For that reason, if these methods free us from time to screen
“manually” the RNV3P database in the search of new associations not visible from usual statistic analyses, in turn they require from us much time to analyse the signals generated, and
exclude the obvious false positive. Another limit is that these
methods do not take into account the effects of multi-exposure.
That’s a reason why, we also develop methods that will take
into account this important point [21].
Finally, we should not forget that to discover potentially
new D × E associations, the first and most important point is
that our scheme continuously increases its ability to capture
those cases (i.e., that our “vigie/vigilance” action is well-known
from a majority of physicians who would refer to us these cases), and that our coding allow information to be of high quality
and accurate (dynamic evolution of the codes, homogeneity of
coding practices, etc).
