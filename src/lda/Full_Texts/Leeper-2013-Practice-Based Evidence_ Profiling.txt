Abstract
Background: Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is a growing problem with few available therapies. Cilostazol is the only FDAapproved medication with a class I indication for intermittent claudication, but carries a black box warning due to concerns
for increased cardiovascular mortality. To assess the validity of this black box warning, we employed a novel text-analytics
pipeline to quantify the adverse events associated with Cilostazol use in a clinical setting, including patients with congestive
heart failure (CHF).
Methods and Results: We analyzed the electronic medical records of 1.8 million subjects from the Stanford clinical data
warehouse spanning 18 years using a novel text-mining/statistical analytics pipeline. We identified 232 PAD patients taking
Cilostazol and created a control group of 1,160 PAD patients not taking this drug using 1:5 propensity-score matching. Over
a mean follow up of 4.2 years, we observed no association between Cilostazol use and any major adverse cardiovascular
event including stroke (OR = 1.13, CI [0.82, 1.55]), myocardial infarction (OR = 1.00, CI [0.71, 1.39]), or death (OR = 0.86, CI
[0.63, 1.18]). Cilostazol was not associated with an increase in any arrhythmic complication. We also identified a subset of
CHF patients who were prescribed Cilostazol despite its black box warning, and found that it did not increase mortality in
this high-risk group of patients.
Conclusions: This proof of principle study shows the potential of text-analytics to mine clinical data warehouses to uncover
‘natural experiments’ such as the use of Cilostazol in CHF patients. We envision this method will have broad applications for
examining difficult to test clinical hypotheses and to aid in post-marketing drug safety surveillance. Moreover, our
observations argue for a prospective study to examine the validity of a drug safety warning that may be unnecessarily
limiting the use of an efficacious therapy.

only FDA-approved medication that carries a class I indication for
the treatment of intermittent claudication [7]. Cilostazol is a type
III phosphodiesterase inhibitor that possesses both vasodilatory
and anti-platelet properties, and has been shown to improve
maximal walking distance significantly compared to placebo in a
series of prospective randomized clinical trials [8,9]. Cilostazol can
induce a number of minor side effects such as headache and
diarrhea, but generally has been observed to be safe with regards
to major cardiovascular events such as myocardial infarction,
stroke and death [10,11]. However, other phosphodiesterase
inhibitors such as milrinone have been associated with increased
mortality rates in patients with congestive heart failure (CHF) [12],
and Cilostazol has therefore been issued a black box warning
despite never having been shown to increase risk of any major
clinical endpoint [12,13]. Prior attempts to quantify this risk were
underpowered and did not lead to reversal of the FDA’s risk

Introduction
Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is a growing problem that now
accounts for every fifth dollar spent on inpatient cardiovascular
care in the United States [1]. This condition affects approximately
8 million Americans, and is associated with significantly impaired
long-term cardiovascular outcomes [2]. For example, PAD
patients have been shown to have high rates of mortality, stroke
and myocardial infarction (MI), with an equal or even greater risk
of events than those subjects with a diagnosis of cerebrovascular or
coronary artery disease [3]. Patients with claudication also report
reduced quality of life, experience higher rates of clinical
depression, and are measurably more sedentary than non-PAD
patients [4–6].
Despite the impact of this disease, very few medical therapies
are available to the patient with PAD. Indeed, Cilostazol is the

assessment [14]. To additionally quantify the risk associated with
this black box warning, we developed a novel text-analytics
pipeline to examine the adverse event profile [15] of Cilostazol in a
clinical setting, and also in patients with CHF.

Study Covariates and Outcome Variables
We defined several covariates for propensity score matching and
several outcome variables for comparison. Each variable is
composed of a set of concepts, and each concept contains several
terms. For example, the variable ‘‘myocardial infarction’’ is
composed of 18 different concepts, including C0027051 (myocardial infarction), C0340324 (silent myocardial infarction) and
C0155626 (acute myocardial infarction), etc. (see Material S1).
Each of these concepts can be further decomposed into the terms,
which are actually mentioned in the clinical notes. For example,
the terms ‘‘heart attack’’ and ‘‘myocardial infarction’’ both count
as mentions of the concept C0027051 (myocardial infarction). The
list of concepts and terms defining the covariates as well as the
outcome variables used in this study was manually curated and can
be found in the Material S1.
We defined an index time point of treatment for all patients,
and grouped all annotations into two groups: concepts associated
with clinical events that happened before treatment (which can
therefore be used for matching patients) and concepts associated
with events that happened after the treatment (and can therefore
be interpreted as outcomes). We scanned the annotations of each
patient for the occurrence of concepts before and after the index
time point to create a binary matrix; where for each patient we set
the variable to 1 or 0 indicating that the concepts had been
mentioned in the clinical notes or not. We extracted the
demographic variables age, gender and race, and used a crossreference of the STRIDE data with the social security index
(SSDI) to define the outcome variable ‘‘death (SSDI)’’.

Methods
Data Sources
We used clinical notes from the Stanford Translational
Research Integrated Database Environment (STRIDE). For
validation of our findings in the CHF subgroup we used data
from the Palo Alto Medical Foundation (PAMF).
The STRIDE dataset spans 18-years’ worth of data from 1.8
million patients; it contains 19 million encounters, 35 million
coded ICD9 diagnoses, and a combination of pathology,
radiology, and transcription reports totaling over 11 million
unstructured clinical notes.
The PAMF dataset spans 13-years’ worth of patient data from
1.2 million patients; it contains 78 million encounters, 64 million
coded ICD9 diagnoses, and a combination of progress notes,
pathology, radiology, and transcription reports totaling over 50
million unstructured clinical notes.
The use of these data sources has been approved by the
Institutional Review Boards at Stanford and PAMF.

Data Collection and Processing
We processed the unstructured clinical notes as described in
Figure 1 and by LePendu et al. [16]. In brief, we used an optimized
version of the NCBO Annotator [17,18] with a set of 22 clinically
relevant ontologies. We removed ambiguous terms using a variety
of statistical and manual filters [19–22], and flagged negated terms
as well as terms attributed to family history [23,24]. We
normalized all drugs to their ingredients using RxNorm, such
that the terms ‘‘pletal’’ and ‘‘cilostazol’’ are both normalized to the
ingredient Cilostazol. We normalized remaining terms to clinical
concepts and aggregated the concepts according to hierarchical
relationships, e.g., patients with acute myocardial infarction are
also counted as persons with myocardial infarction. Finally, we
ordered the set of all concepts for each note based on the time at
which the note was recorded. As a result, for every patient, we
have sets of concepts spaced apart in time based on the clinical
notes they were mentioned in, comprising the patient-feature
matrix (see Figure 1).
We recognize drug exposure and clinical conditions based on
the temporally ordered concept mentions. We validated the
accuracy using a manually annotated gold standard corpus (from
the 2008 i2b2 Obesity Challenge [25]). This corpus is manually
annotated by two annotators for 16 conditions and was designed to
evaluate the ability of NLP systems to identify a condition present
for a patient based on textual notes. On average, we achieved 98%
specificity for recognizing disease conditions with a precision of
90%. In particular, for PAD we have 98% specificity (with 83%
precision) and for CHF 95% specificity (with 92% precision). We
trade sensitivity for ensuring high specificity and precision; and
sensitivity is around 73%. However, given the large dataset we
begin with, we are still able to identify large enough cohorts for the
study. Drug recognition is done in a similar manner using strings
from RxNORM and an independent study at the University of
Pittsburgh, which examined the annotations on 1960 clinical notes
manually [26], estimated over 84% sensitivity and 84% specificity
for recognizing drugs.

Study Period and Study Groups
We extracted data from our annotations for all patients with
PAD, as defined by mention of the peripheral artery disease terms
listed in Table 1. To allow a detailed analysis of multiple clinical
endpoints, we excluded patients having less than one year’s worth
of data after their first PAD mention to ensure sufficient clinical
follow up data for each patient. For the Cilostazol study group, we
selected those PAD patients who had a Cilostazol mention after or
at the same time as their first PAD mention. We then used 1:5
propensity score matching to define a control group.
To summarize, patients in the Cilostazol study group met the
following criteria: (i) they had to have a diagnosis of PAD as
defined by mention of the PAD-related terms listed above, (ii) the
first PAD mention had to be before or at the same time as the
Cilostazol mention, (iii) the patients were required to have at least
one year worth of data after their first PAD mention. The control
group similarly carried a diagnosis of PAD, had no mention of
Cilostazol, and was matched to the Cilostazol group by propensity
score matching based on expert selected variables.

Congestive Heart Failure Study Subgroup
In addition to the total PAD group, we also extracted patients
who had a mention of CHF in their clinical notes before the first
mention of Cilostazol. The electronic records of these subjects
containing the CHF annotation were manually reviewed to
confirm the clinical diagnosis of CHF and to ensure the
correctness of the temporal ordering. We then used 1:5 propensity
score matching to construct a control group from all other PAD
patients who also had a history of CHF, but no Cilostazol
prescription.

Propensity Score Matching and Statistical Methods
We used propensity score matching to construct control groups.
For this purpose, we first fit a propensity score model using logistic

Figure 1. Generation of the patient–feature matrix. (1) The workflow downloads ,5.6 M strings from the 22 clinically relevant ontologies as
well as trigger terms from NegEx and ConText for negation detection. (2) It uses term frequency and syntactic type information (e.g., predominant
noun phrases) from MedLine to prune the set of strings into a clean lexicon, and (3) then applies the lexicon directly against the textual clinical notes
using exact string matching. (4) The workflow furthermore uses NegEx and ConText rules to filter negated terms and terms within family history
contexts. (5) Next, UMLS and BioPortal mappings and semantic type information are used to normalize terms into concepts, which are furthermore
grouped into the semantic groups ‘‘drug’’, ‘‘disease’’, ‘‘device’’, or ‘‘procedure’’. (6) Finally, the annotations of the clinical notes are used to construct
the patient–feature matrix, where each row of the matrix represents a patient and the columns are the clinical concepts annotated in the patients
clinical notes; here the time stamps of the clinical notes induce a temporal ordering of the annotations over the entire patient–feature matrix.

regression where the treatment assignment (Cilostazol vs. no
Cilostazol) was regressed on the 18 covariates marked in Table 2,
including the demographic variables, age at first PAD mention,
gender and race, as well as several co-morbidities and coprescriptions. We then used the Matching package for R [27] to
perform 1:5 propensity score matching without replacement and
to check balance in the variables between the Cilostazol and
control groups. We analyzed the success of the matching–whether
covariate values were balanced across the two groups after
matching–by examining for significant differences in means for
continuous variables and significant differences in percentages for
indicator variables using a p-value significance level of 0.05. To
account for the matched nature of the data, we then used
conditional logistic regression [28] of the Survival package for R
[29] to compute odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for
several outcome variables. The same analysis was performed for
the patients with a history of CHF. Furthermore, we performed
standard multivariate logistic regression to compute odds ratios
which: 1) compare the Cilostazol group with all other unmatched
PAD patients, 2) adjust for confounding by including several

covariates, as well as the propensity scores themselves in the
regression model (see Material S2).

Results
In the current paper, we describe a study performed using freetext clinical notes from the clinical data warehouse at Stanford.
Our text-processing pipeline converts clinical notes from a
patient’s medical record into a patient-feature matrix for data
mining as described in the Methods. In order to study the
outcomes in patients with PAD taking Cilostazol, we examined for
differences in several clinical outcomes comparing patients taking
Cilostazol with a matched control group. As described in the
methods, we defined an index time point (the time point at which
treatment for PAD started) and scanned the patient’s annotations
for occurrence of the variables before and after that time point.
We then used variables mentioned before the index time point for
propensity score matching and variables mentioned after that time
point as outcome variables. We analyzed outcomes between the
232 patients on Cilostazol in STRIDE, and their matched controls
by comparing for significant differences in major adverse
cardiovascular events (MACE), major adverse limb events
(MALE), and symptoms for arrhythmias. We also examined a
small cohort of patients with congestive heart failure who were
prescribed Cilostazol and validated our findings for the CHF
subgroup in an independent dataset.

[1.89, 4.05]) (see Figure 2B). Again, similar results were obtained
using different ways to adjust for confounders (see Material S2).

PAD patients to the 5,757 PAD patients with at least one year of
clinical follow up, as described in the methods. For this reduced
study set, we had on average more than 8 years’ worth of data
spanning the index time point of treatment for each patient In this
group, we identified 232 PAD patients taking Cilostazol and
compared them to the other 5,525 PAD patients in the STRIDE
database. Table 2 summarizes the prevalence of several clinical
variables in the Cilostazol study group and the unmatched PAD
control patients. On average, the Cilostazol patients are older, are
more likely male, have more comorbidities, are prescribed more
medications and have had more major adverse limb events than
PAD patients not taking Cilostazol (p-value ,0.05 for each
condition); hence on average Cilostazol patients are sicker than the
other PAD patients. After using propensity score matching, we
were able to identify a cohort of 1160 controls (1:5 matching) that
were fully balanced for all 18 clinical variables (see Table 2). This
group was used to compare all subsequent clinical outcomes. In
total, 5,892 patient-years of data were available for the subjects
studied compared to 2136 patient-years in [14].

Differences
in
arrhythmias
and
arrhythmic
symptoms. Despite the concern that Cilostazol may increase

malignant arrhythmias, we did not observe any statistically
significant differences between the Cilostazol and control PAD
patients (either before or after matching) with respect to cardiac
arrhythmias, nor typical arrhythmia symptoms (see Figure 2C) and
Material S2).

Outcomes in PAD Patients with CHF Taking Cilostazol
We identified several patients who had an annotation of CHF
before the first mention of Cilostazol. After manually reviewing
their medical records, we confirmed that 43 patients with a
diagnosis of CHF were subsequently prescribed Cilostazol for
PAD. We used these patients to comprise a CHF study subgroup.
Again, we observed an imbalance in several variables including
gender, several co-prescriptions and history of revascularization
events. Using propensity score matching, we extracted a control
group of 215 PAD patients who also had a history of CHF but
were not prescribed Cilostazol, and then compared both groups
with respect to different outcomes. Matching removed pre-existing
imbalance in the covariates (see Material S3). Importantly,
Cilostazol use was not associated with an increase in any major
adverse cardiovascular event amongst heart failure patients.
Similarly, no increase in arrhythmia, arrhythmic symptoms, or
sudden cardiac death was observed in this subgroup analysis (see
Figure 3). We again observed slightly increased odds ratios for
major adverse limb events, in particular revascularization events,
confirming that the PAD of the Cilostazol patients was more
advanced.
We also extracted data for 96 PAD patients with a history of
CHF who were prescribed Cilostazol from an independent data
source at PAMF. We manually validated the CHF subgroup
similarly as done for the STRIDE dataset. Using propensity score
matching we constructed a fully balanced matched control group
of 480 patients (for balance analysis see Material S4), and analyzed
differences in clinical outcomes between the two groups using the
same methods as for STRIDE data. We observed the same trend
as seen for the STRIDE data in Figure 3 (see Table 3).

Outcomes in PAD Patients Taking Cilostazol
Differences in claudication symptoms. We first quantified
the frequency with which subjects in each group reported
improvement or resolution of claudication symptoms over time.
We were able to ‘re-discover’ that Cilostazol use was associated
with a significant reduction in symptomatology [30]–defined by
mentions of phrases such as ‘‘no claudication’’, ‘‘no complaints of
claudication’’, or ‘‘no sign of claudication’’ after assignment to the
Cilostazol group (OR = 2.35, CI [1.75, 3.14]–thus providing a
positive control for our approach.
Another example that such text-mining approaches don’t
always result in negative findings, is given by our recently
published study, in which we used similar techniques to detect
adverse drug reactions from the clinical notes and achieved 80.4%
AUC on a gold standard of positive and negative drug-adverse
event associations as well as detected 6 out of 9 recalls in the past
decade including the association between Vioxx and Myocardial
infarction [15,16].
Differences in major adverse cardiovascular events
(MACE). To assess the impact of Cilostazol therapy on major

clinical outcomes, we then computed odds ratios for several major
adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), including myocardial
infarction, stroke, cardiac arrest, sudden cardiac death and
defibrillation events. Compared to the entire unmatched PAD
cohort, those prescribed Cilostazol had slightly higher rates of
MACE (crude OR = 1.37, CI [1.05, 1.79]). However, after
matching on potential confounders, Cilostazol was not associated
with any major cardiovascular endpoint including death
(OR = 0.86, CI [0.63, 1.18]), MI (OR = 1.00, CI [0.71, 1.39]),
or stroke (OR = 1.13, CI [0.82, 1.55]) in the matched cohort (see
Figure 2A). Similar results were obtained adjusting the crude odds
ratios for different potential confounders (see Material S2).
Differences in major adverse Limb events (MALE). To
assess the impact of Cilostazol therapy on PAD-specific outcomes,
we next compared major adverse limb events (MALE) such as
amputation and lower extremity revascularization. As expected,
the Cilostazol group had much more advanced PAD than the
unmatched control PAD group, with significantly higher rates of
MALE (crude OR = 6.26, CI [4.30, 9.13]) and each PAD-specific
endpoint (see Material S2). Compared to the matched control
group, the difference in odds ratios between the groups reduced,
but still remained significantly different for MALE (OR = 2.84, CI
[1.87, 4.29]), amputation (OR = 1.47, CI [0.97, 2.22]), bypass
(OR = 1.53, CI [1.14, 2.07]) and revascularization (OR = 2.77, CI

Discussion
In this study, we employed a novel analytical approach to
conduct the equivalent of a phase IV safety surveillance study on
an efficacious, yet potentially dangerous FDA-approved drug. By
querying the clinical medical records of over 1.8 million patients
with our pipeline, we were able to identify a large cohort of PAD
subjects that were matched with the exception of exposure to
Cilostazol, the agent of interest in this study. Using this approach,
we did not observe any difference in mortality comparing the
Cilostazol patients to all other unmatched PAD patients. We
furthermore observed no association between Cilostazol and any
major adverse cardiovascular event including stroke, myocardial
infarction or death in a reduced fully matched study set, which is
in good agreement with earlier studies [31]. We also identified a
subset of CHF patients who were prescribed Cilostazol, and
interestingly found that it did not appear to increase mortality in
this theoretically high-risk group of patients. This proof of
principle study shows the potential of data-mining methods to
query unstructured data in clinical data warehouses to answer
important, but difficult to address clinical questions [32].
Moreover, it argues for a prospective study to examine the

differences. Because this work is performed with data from a ‘real
world’ clinical setting, patients who would have been excluded
from most clinical trials are also examined, such as the patients
with recognized CHF who were prescribed Cilostazol. Given
Cilostazol’s black box warning, it is difficult to imagine a scenario
where these patients would have been enrolled into a trial that was
supported by a pharmaceutical company and endorsed by an
academic Institutional Review Board. While our findings do not
prove that Cilostazol is safe in heart failure patients, they help
make the case for a prospective study in this cohort.
Because the full medical record can be queried, this approach
also offers the benefit of allowing a wide spectrum of endpoints to
be assessed. Also, at-risk and other understudied subgroups such as
children, the elderly, minorities, pregnant women and those with
multiple comorbidities could be studied with this approach. In the
current study, we focused heavily on potential arrhythmic
complications given the high incidence of palpitations reported
in the original Cilostazol studies. Importantly, no increase in
arrhythmia was observed and there was no increase in total
mortality or sudden cardiac death – endpoints, which would have

validity of an unproven FDA-issued black box warning that likely
limits the broad application of a clinically effective therapy.
In many situations, clinical hypotheses often go untested due to
ethical concerns around presumed benefit. Examples include the
use of PVC-suppressing antiarrythmics post MI or hormone
replacement in menopausal women, each of which was found to
promote, not prevent risk when formally tested [33,34]. Similarly,
clinical trials often do not study the most complicated patients due
to concerns over the impact of comorbidities, and clinicians often
have little data to guide therapy for the sickest patients. We argue
that in the era of electronic medical records, it is possible to
harness the knowledge embedded in clinical data warehouses to
inform therapy decisions [32] as well as perform phase IV
surveillance [15,16,35]. The informatics approaches employed in
the current study allow for uncovering ‘natural experiments’ that
would otherwise be difficult to perform–generating practice-based
evidence.
By looking at large enough sample sets, it is possible to identify
patients of interest who have been exposed to a given treatment
approach, compare them to patients who are otherwise indistinguishable, and observe their clinical outcomes for significant

been detected by cross-referencing with the Social Security Death
Index.
This study has several potential limitations that warrant
discussion. Although our annotation pipeline has been shown to
have a specificity of 98% for recognizing diseases, we could have
missed comorbidities due to false negatives from lower sensitivity
(73%). However, these errors should be equally distributed across
case and control groups. We performed standard propensity score
matching in order to reduce potential bias introduced by
imbalance in the covariates; however matching may not have
been complete. For example, we did not have access to the
subjects’ ankle-brachial indices, and therefore could not quantitate
the severity of each patient’s peripheral stenosis at baseline.
Indeed, we observed that the Cilostazol group had higher rates of
MALE than control subjects. While we cannot exclude the
possibility that Cilostazol promotes the progression of PAD, we
view this as an unlikely possibility given the multiple published
randomized, placebo-controlled trials demonstrating efficacy of
Cilostazol [10,11]. Rather, we suspect that the groups were not
completely matched for PAD severity at baseline, given that
Cilostazol is generally prescribed to subjects with lifestyle-limiting
claudication [3,36–38]. As a result, the Cilostazol group may have
had higher-grade ischemic lesions, which necessitated the observed
increase in peripheral interventions and MALE. However, if an
unmeasured residual imbalance was present, it would bolster the
interpretation that Cilostazol is likely safe from a cardiovascular
mortality perspective, in that the treatment group presumably had
more advanced atherosclerosis, yet had no increase in arrhythmia
or cardiovascular events when taking the drug. Moreover, we
applied different models including a variety of additional potential
confounders and the results did not change (for details see Material
S2). Finally, the outcome measures may not have captured events
occurring outside of the hospital or that led to hospitalizations in
other institutions. However, we note that the endpoint of death
was captured for all patients via cross-referencing with the Social
Security Death Index data, giving confidence in our conclusions
about survival. Also, our ‘re-discovery’ that Cilostazol reduces
claudication complaints provides a ‘positive control’ to illustrate
the potential of our approach for detecting subjective clinical
endpoints.
In conclusion, we used an informatics approach to examine the
side-effect profile of Cilostazol and to indirectly assess the validity
of a black box warning that was originally issued over theoretical
concerns. We find that the feared complications of malignant

PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org

arrhythmia and sudden death were not observed in association
with the drug in the cohort examined. We used our analytics
approach to discover and examine a ‘natural experiment’ in a
subset of patients that would be difficult to enroll in a clinical trial
and found that Cilostazol had no untoward effect on survival
amongst heart failure patients. This result supports the argument
for a prospective randomized trial in CHF patients, which need
not be considered unsafe or unethical.
We believe that similar Phase IV monitoring could be executed
for other drugs without a proven safety record to identify sequelae
not recognized at the time of FDA review. We expect that such
data-mining driven surveillance approaches will have broad
applicability to the field of pharmaceutical safety and will become
a key aspect of Phase IV post-marketing surveillance, particularly
for patient groups not likely to be studied in randomized clinical
trials.
