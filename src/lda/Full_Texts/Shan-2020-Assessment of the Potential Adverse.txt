Purpose. We aimed to analyze and evaluate the safety signals of ribavirin-interferon combination through data mining of the US
Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS), so as to provide reference for the rationale use of
these agents in the management of relevant toxicities emerging in patients with novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19).
Methods. Reports to the FAERS from 1 January 2004 to 8 March 2020 were analyzed. The proportion of report ratio (PRR),
reporting odds ratio (ROR), and Bayesian conﬁdence interval progressive neural network (BCPNN) method were used to detect
the safety signals. Results. A total of 55 safety signals were detected from the top 250 adverse event reactions in 2200 reports, but
19 signals were not included in the drug labels. All the detected adverse event reactions were associated with 13 System Organ
Classes (SOC), such as gastrointestinal, blood and lymph, hepatobiliary, endocrine, and various nervous systems. The most
frequent adverse events were analyzed, and the results showed that females were more likely to suﬀer from anemia, vomiting,
neutropenia, diarrhea, and insomnia. Conclusion. The ADE (adverse drug event) signal detection based on FAERS is helpful to
clarify the potential adverse events related to ribavirin-interferon combination for novel coronavirus therapy; clinicians should
pay attention to the adverse reactions of gastrointestinal and blood systems, closely monitor the ﬂuctuations of the platelet
count, and carry out necessary mental health interventions to avoid serious adverse events.

1. Introduction
Since December 2019, the novel coronavirus pneumonia
(COVID-19) has exploded in China and spread to many
countries and regions around the world. At present, there is
no clinically eﬀective antiviral drug for COVID 19; according
to the antiviral treatment recommended by China, ribavirin
is suggested to be used in combination with interferon or
lopinavir/ritonavir.
Ribavirin (RBV) is a purine nucleoside analogue with
broad-spectrum antiviral activity, which can be used in combination with interferon (IFN) for the treatment of chronic
hepatitis C [1], and was also an empirical treatment regimen
during the outbreak of the Middle East respiratory syndrome
coronavirus (MERS-CoV) [2]. The drug labels list the possible adverse drug events (ADEs), but less attention has been

paid to the potential adverse events related to ribavirininterferon combination, mainly including lower respiratory
tract infection, suicide attempt, gastrointestinal ulcer, cerebral hemorrhage, mental disorder, and hallucinations. Studies have conﬁrmed that ribavirin-interferon combination
can lead to arteriosclerosis [3] and even cause heart enlargement in patients to develop into dilated cardiomyopathy [4].
However, all these ADEs are not listed in the drug labels, due
to the delay of the update of the labels and the complexity of
united medication. Ribavirin-interferon combination was
recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 [5], but there
was less information on the ADEs. A spontaneous reporting
system is an important data source for monitoring ADEs in
the world, and the FDA established the US Food and Drug
Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS)
database to support postmarketing surveillance programs.

2
The real-world data can provide information to help clinicians weigh the risks and beneﬁts of these agents. Therefore,
we aimed to analyze and evaluate the safety signals of
ribavirin-interferon combination through data mining of
the FAERS, in order to assess the potential adverse events
related to the combination for novel coronavirus therapy.

2. Methods
2.1. Data Source. The FDA publishes FAERS ﬁles every quarter, and each quarterly ﬁle package contains the following
seven data ﬁles: demographic and administrative information, drug information, adverse drug reaction information,
patient outcome information, drug therapy start dates and
end dates, information on report sources, and indications
for use/diagnosis [6]. The adverse events are coded using
the Preferred Terms (PTs) from the Medical Dictionary for
Regulatory Activities (MedDRA).
In this study, a research AE analysis tool was used to
extract adverse events from the FAERS database. Searches
were performed using both the generic and brand names of
ribavirin and interferon, and the reports were included when
ribavirin and interferon were both suspected to be the primary agent. The top 250 adverse events were retrieved from
the FAERS database which covered the period from 1 January 2004 to 8 March 2020.
2.2. Data Mining Algorithm. A spontaneous reporting system
is an important data source for monitoring adverse drug
reactions in the world and ﬁnding the signals of adverse drug
reactions after marketing. To identify drug-associated
adverse events as signals, a disproportionality analysis is
regarded as a fundamental tool of analytic methods, which
compares the proportion of occurring adverse events
between the study drug and all other drugs [7]. While disproportionality analysis includes the frequency and Bayesian
methods, no “gold standard” is available, and each of the
above methods has its own characteristics [8]. Both the proportional reporting ratio (PRR) [9] and reporting odds ratio
(ROR) [10] are frequency methods. They are easy for calculation and can lead to a more sensitive output than Bayesian
approaches. However, frequency measures are extremely
sensitive to small ﬂuctuations in the number of reports.
Results are not always credible in the event of small numbers
in cells a, b, c, and d in a two-by-two frequency table. The
Bayesian conﬁdence propagation neural network (BCPNN)
[11] is always applicable and large numbers of calculations
can be made eﬃciently, but it is relatively nontransparent
for people unfamiliar with Bayesian statistics. No one algorithm is universally better than others. In order to reduce
the bias of a single algorithm, PRR, ROR, and BCPNN were
used to detect the signals. The combination of three signal
mining methods can improve the sensitivity and speciﬁcity
of adverse event signal detection, reducing the false-positive
rate to ensure the reliability of signal detection results. These
algorithms extract decision rules for evaluating associations
between drugs and adverse events from a two-by-two frequency table of counts that involve the presence or absence

of the study drug and the particular event occurring in case
reports (see Table 1).
For the PRR and ROR, a signal is detected if the lower
bound of the 95% two-sided conﬁdence interval (CI) exceeds
1.0. Using the BCPNN, IC‐2SD > 0 results in a signal, and the
algorithm is shown in Equation (1). In this study, adverse
events were listed as drug-associated, when all three indices
met the aforementioned criteria. The higher the scores of
PRR, ROR, and BCPNN, the stronger the association
between drugs and adverse events.

3. Results
3.1. Ribavirin and Interferon-Associated Adverse Events. During the study period, a total of 2200 adverse event reports
were reported with ribavirin and interferon as the ﬁrst suspected drugs. Demographic characteristics of patients and
composition of serious adverse events are shown in Table 2.
A total of 827 reports were from medical staﬀ, accounting
for 37.59% of all reports. In terms of gender composition,
1128 reports were linked to males, which accounted for
51.27% of all reports, and the age was concentrated at
45-64 years. Serious adverse events after combined use
accounted for 44.60%, of which the most frequently reported
cases were hospitalization or prolonged hospitalization.
3.2. Signal Detections for RBV and IFN. A total of 55 positive
signals were detected from the top 250 adverse event reactions in 2200 reports and described according to their System
Organ Class (SOC), as deﬁned in MedDRA. All the detected
adverse event reactions were associated with 13 SOC, such as
gastrointestinal, blood and lymph, hepatobiliary, endocrine,
and various nervous systems (see Table 3). We counted the
reports of each adverse event; the most frequent adverse
events displayed according to SOC were gastrointestinal

16.35%), psychiatric (311 reports, 14.28%), medical examination (287 reports, 13.18%), and skin and subcutaneous tissues
(286 reports, 13.13%) (see Figure 1).
In order to identify gender-speciﬁc diﬀerences in
adverse events, the most frequent adverse events were analyzed by ROR. ROR > 1 indicates that females are more
likely to have adverse reactions, and ROR < 1 indicates
that males are more likely to have adverse reactions [12].
The results showed that females were more likely to suﬀer
from anemia (ROR = 1:18), vomiting (ROR = 2:75), neutropenia (ROR = 1:97), diarrhea (ROR = 1:99), and insomnia (ROR = 1:40) than males (see Table 4).
According to the results, 19 signals were not included in
the drug labels, which accounted for 34.55% of all safety
signals, including ascites, splenomegaly, hemoptysis, and
rectal bleeding. The list contains designated medical events
(DME) containing medical conditions that are inherently
serious and often medicine-related. In order to highlight
the clinical relevance of the signals, we veriﬁed whether these
PTs are listed in the DME provided by the European Medicines Agency (EMA). The results showed that hepatic failure
(PPR = 4:96, ROR = 4:97, and IC‐2SD = 2:14) and hemoptysis (PPR = 2:63, ROR = 2:63, IC‐2SD = 1:17) were on the
DME list.

4. Discussion
Previous research has shown that anemia, neutropenia,
mood swings, and adverse reactions of the skin system
were the most common adverse events in patients during
the treatment of ribavirin-interferon combination [13–15].
In our research, anemia (256 reports, PRR = 12:45, ROR =
12:48, and IC‐2SD = 3:42), depression (149 reports, PRR =
5:32, ROR = 5:32, and IC‐2SD = 2:29), and rash (173 reports,
PRR = 4:22, ROR = 4:22, and IC‐2SD = 1:96) were the signals
that have the higher number of reports and PRR, ROR, and IC
values in each system. The FDA adverse event database is
mainly from patients with hepatitis, and the results of signal
screening were consistent with the adverse reactions reported
in the literature. The safety signal screening based on the FDA
adverse event database indicates the potential ADEs related to
ribavirin-interferon combination and can also provide a reference for novel coronavirus therapy.
According to the results, during the treatment of ribavirininterferon combination, the most commonly reported adverse
events were in the gastrointestinal system, mainly manifested
as vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal distention, and other discomfort. Gastrointestinal adverse events will result in a loss
of appetite and poor sleep quality, and even drug stoppage if
things get worse. This will limit the use of antiviral drugs
and aﬀect the therapeutic eﬀect of patients. Thus, how to
reduce the gastrointestinal adverse events of patients with
COVID-19 may be the focus of clinical attention. Health education can be carried out among patients by clinicians, so that
patients can know the disease and drugs correctly. When
patients realize that gastrointestinal reaction is a normal phenomenon, their uneasiness will be reduced. For patients with
gastrointestinal discomfort, clinicians should provide timely
symptomatic treatment, adjust the diet structure of patients,
and reduce the stimulating food.
Ribavirin-interferon combination can also lead to blood
and lymphatic system diseases and abnormal medical examination indicators. It has been proven that patients often suﬀer
from anemia, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, and other
symptoms during the combined treatment [13, 14]. When
ribavirin and interferon are coadministered in patients with
COVID-19, close monitoring of the hemoglobin level is recommended. For patients with anemia, dose reduction is
needed if there is an unknown reason for the decline of hemoglobin; ADEs should be identiﬁed. In a multicenter trial [16],
one patient stopped treatment at the 42nd week of treatment
due to the decrease of platelet to 45000/mm3. In another study
[17], a case of death due to combined treatment was reported.
At the start of treatment, the patient already had a rather low
platelet count; the platelet further drops after the combined
treatment and ﬁnally leads to death. Dosages were reduced
according to the drug labels, but further dose reductions might
be needed for this patient. This suggests that the abnormality
of the medical examination index may cause serious adverse
reactions and even death. For patients with a low blood cell
count at the start of treatment, clinicians should reduce the
dosages according to the drug labels and adjust the dose
according to the situation of patients during the treatment to
avoid serious adverse events.

Figure 1: Number of adverse event reports associated with each SOC.

Depression was a signal with a higher number of reports
and PRR, ROR, and IC values in the nervous system. At
present, studies have conﬁrmed that patients undergoing
treatment of ribavirin-interferon combination will increase
the risk of diseases such as depression and anxiety [17, 18].
In the face of an outbreak, patients with COVID-19 may be
lonely, anxious, and have insomnia and are more likely not
to cooperate with the treatment due to fear of the disease. Clinicians need to objectively communicate with patients about
the changes of disease and epidemic situation and encourage
patients to cooperate with the treatment. In order to reduce
the occurrence of adverse events and protect the mental

health of patients, the involvement of a psychiatrist may be
necessary. At the same time, this study analyzed the
gender-speciﬁc diﬀerences of the 10 adverse events with the
highest number of reports. Female patients may be more
prone to mood swings, which may cause insomnia, vomiting,
and other diseases.
According to the signal detection results, 19 signals were
not listed in the drug labels, and they may be considered as
unexpected. The biggest limitation of this approach is confounding by indication and failed to highlight the clinical relevance of the signals. For instance, ascites and splenomegaly
are likely to be disease-related complications (HCV, with

cirrhosis). Hepatic events are likely to be related to the underlying hepatic damage, but patients may also receive other
hepatotoxic drugs. Hepatic failure and hemoptysis are the
only two signals that are listed in the DME, which are inherently serious and often medicine-related. Although they are
not listed in the drug labels, they indicate the possible adverse
events in the treatment of ribavirin-interferon combination.
A prospective multicenter study in Thailand [17] showed
that a patient with HCV and HIV had severe hemoptysis
after treatment with ribavirin-interferon combination and
was consistent with our signal detection results. ADEs cannot
be easily detected in studies conducted before the drug
reaches the market; new adverse reports may appear after
the drug is marketed, while the update of the drug label is lagging behind. Previous studies have shown ADEs that are not
listed in the drug labels of ribavirin and interferon, such as
aortosclerosis [3], dilated cardiomyopathy [4], leprosy [19],
and glycosylated hemoglobin 1Ac reduction [20]. According
to the results, clinicians should also pay attention to the
adverse reactions of hepatic failure and hemoptysis. Especially for novel coronavirus-infected patients, adverse reactions may accelerate the progression of the disease and
cause fatal risks.
In this study, signal detection is based on the spontaneous reporting database, which has some shortcomings such
as missing reports and repeated reports. This study only
focused on the adverse events of ribavirin-interferon combination, but did not take into account the basic diseases and
other combined medications of patients. It is quite impossible to identify which patient is prescribed these drugs and
for what reason. Also, we do not have information regarding
how long patients were on one of the drugs prior to starting
on combination therapy. The positive signals detected in this
study only indicate that there is a statistical correlation
between the drug and adverse events, and the clear causal
correlation needs to be conﬁrmed by further research.

5. Conclusions
Based on the FDA adverse event database, 55 positive signals
were detected in this study. The most frequent adverse events
displayed according to SOC were gastrointestinal system diseases, blood and lymphatic system diseases, psychiatric dis-

eases, medical examination, and skin and subcutaneous
tissue diseases. During the treatment of ribavirin-interferon
combination, patients may have adverse reactions in the gastrointestinal and blood system, and pharmaceutical care
should be strengthened to avoid serious adverse events.
Hepatic failure and hemoptysis were the positive signals that
are not listed in the drug labels but in the DME list.
They were considered inherently serious and often medicine-related.
The signal detection and analysis by using the database of
a spontaneous reporting system can warn of adverse events
that may occur in the practical treatment of ribavirin and
interferon. In the special environment of a new epidemic situation, it can provide reference for rationale use of these
agents in the management of relevant toxicities emerging in
patients with COVID-19.
