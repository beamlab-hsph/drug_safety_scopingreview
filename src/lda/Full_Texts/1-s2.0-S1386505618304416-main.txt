Objective: Recent advances in Web 2.0 technologies have seen signiﬁcant strides towards utilizing patientgenerated content for pharmacovigilance. Social media-based pharmacovigilance has great potential to augment
current eﬀorts and provide regulatory authorities with valuable decision aids. Among various pharmacovigilance activities, identifying adverse drug events (ADEs) is very important for patient safety. However, in
health-related discussion forums, ADEs may confound with drug indications and beneﬁcial eﬀects, etc.
Therefore, the focus of this study is to develop a strategy to identify ADEs from other semantic types, and
meanwhile to determine the drug that an ADE is associated with.
Materials and methods: In this study, two groups of features, i.e., shallow linguistic features and semantic features, are explored. Moreover, motivated and inspired by the characteristics of explored two feature categories
for social media-based ADE identiﬁcation, an improved random subspace method, called Stratiﬁed Samplingbased Random Subspace (SSRS), is proposed. Unlike conventional random subspace method that applies random
sampling for subspace selection, SSRS adopts stratiﬁed sampling-based subspace selection strategy.
Results: A case study on heart disease discussion forums is performed to evaluate the eﬀectiveness of the SSRS
method. Experimental results reveal that the proposed SSRS method signiﬁcantly outperforms other compared
ensemble methods and existing approaches for ADE identiﬁcation.
Discussion and conclusion: Our proposed method is easy to implement since it is based on two feature sets that
can be naturally derived, and therefore, can omit artiﬁcial stratum generation eﬀorts. Moreover, SSRS has great
potential of being applied to deal with other high-dimensional problems that can represent original data from
two diﬀerent aspects.

1. Introduction
With the rapid development of information technology, social
media has provided patients a platform to share their experiences about
treatments, the use of prescription drugs, and side eﬀects, etc [1]. It is
reported that 80% of internet users have sought online for health-related information and 24% have consulted online reviews pertaining to
particular drugs or medical treatment [2]. The large amounts of healthrelated social media data has opened up new opportunities for public
health, particularly for pharmacovigilance, which is aimed at detecting,
assessing, understanding, and preventing drug-related problems, including adverse drug events (ADEs) [3,4].
An ADE is any injury due to a drug, irrespective of whether the
medication is taken as per its prescription/label or not [5]. Although
new drugs are required to be tested via clinical trials before their
commercialization, ADE is still a major public health concern, causing

125,000 hospital admissions and aﬀecting approximately 2 million
hospital stays each year in the United States [6]. Pre-marketing clinical
trials suﬀer from important limitations: relatively small and homogeneous populations, short durations, and a small possibility of testing
the concurrent use of other drugs [7,8]. Therefore, post-marketing drug
safety surveillance is of vital importance for stakeholders, including
pharmaceutical companies, regulatory authorities, and patients, etc.
Spontaneous reporting systems (SRSs), such as FDA (Food and Drug
Administration) Adverse Drug Event Reporting System (FAERS) and
VigiBase, are traditional mechanisms for safety monitoring of approved
drugs. However, SRS generally underestimates the number of ADE incidences [7,9].
Due to abovementioned limitations of clinical trials and SRSs, as
well as the abundance and richness of health-related social media data,
it has attracted considerable attention of researchers to explore social
media as a complementary source for timely and accurate detection of

ADEs. ADE descriptions often appear in the text that contains drug/
event pairs in social media [10]. However, on one hand, ADEs may
confound with other semantic types, such as drug indications and
beneﬁcial eﬀects. Prior research has found that only about one-thirds of
sentences with drug and event co-occurrence describe ADEs in a healthrelated discussion forum [11]. On the other hand, the drug associated
with an ADE may be ambiguous in sentences that discuss more than one
drug. For example, in the sentence “Years later I was switched to bisoprolol, because I was grasping at straws about why I was having fatigue and
thought maybe it was the atenolol”, the event “fatigue” is associated with
“atenolol” rather than “bisoprolol”. Therefore, this study focuses on
classifying each drug/event pair in one sentence as ADE or non-ADE, in
order to diﬀerentiate ADEs from other semantic types, and meanwhile
to determine the drug that an ADE is associated with.
There's a serious risk that this classiﬁcation task suﬀers from the highdimensionality problem because there exists frequent use of misspellings,
novel/creative phrases, abbreviations, and colloquial terms in social media
[12]. Therefore, we posit that random subspace [13], an under-examined
ensemble learning method for ADE identiﬁcation, could enhance ADE
identiﬁcation capability. Since the random subspace method presents obvious superiority when the dataset has a large number of redundant and
irrelevant features. To prepare for classiﬁcation, we explore two groups of
features, i.e., shallow linguistic features and semantic features. However, we
observe that the number distribution of features between the two feature
categories is severely imbalanced: thousands in the shallow linguistic feature set and about twenty in the semantic feature set. This serious imbalance could lead to a result that semantic features, which carry important
discriminative information for ADE identiﬁcation, may submerge in the
large number of noisy linguistic features. Therefore, the random sampling
mechanism in random subspace is prone to obtaining base learners with
low accuracy because of the absence of any semantic feature in produced
feature subspaces, further limiting the eﬀectiveness of an ensemble.
To alleviate this deﬁciency, in this study, an improved random
subspace method, called Stratiﬁed Sampling-based Random Subspace
(SSRS), is proposed speciﬁcally for identifying ADEs from social media.
Instead of the random sampling method, SSRS uses the stratiﬁed sampling, which is able to adequately capture the population characteristics
[14,15], for feature subspace selection. Speciﬁcally, we separately
sample features from the shallow linguistic feature set and the semantic
feature set randomly, and then merge these selected features to form a
feature subspace. In order to balance the accuracy and diversity of base
learners, which are two necessary conditions to achieve a good ensemble [16], we introduce two parameters, i.e., shallow linguistic
subspace rate and semantic subspace rate. Extensive experiments are
performed to verify the eﬀectiveness of SSRS in comparison to conventional random subspace, other ensemble learning approaches and
existing ADE identiﬁcation approaches. Our main contributions are
twofold. First, we verify the eﬀectiveness of the random subspace
method in the context of social media-based ADE identiﬁcation. More
importantly, our major contribution lies in the development of an improved random subspace method, which is motivated and inspired by
the characteristics of explored feature categories, for high-performing
social media-based ADE identiﬁcation.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we
discuss the related work on identifying adverse drug events from social
media and random subspace. Section 3 describes the proposed novel
SSRS method for social media-based ADE identiﬁcation. Section 4
presents a case study on heart disease discussion forums. Section 5
reports the experimental setup and results. The last section concludes
the paper.

strides towards utilizing patient-generated content in social media for
active post-marketing drug safety surveillance. Social media holds the
promise of augmenting other pharmacovigilance channels, such as
SRSs, electronic health records, and clinical notes. Prior studies have
explored various social media platforms, including generic social networks (e.g., Twitter [1,9,17–21]) and online health-related discussion
forums, such as DailyStrength [1,8,20–22], MedHelp [10,12,23,24],
Amercian Diabetes Association [10,25], and AskaPatient [19,26]. Previous studies regarding ADE identiﬁcation from social media endeavor
to achieve diﬀerent research goals, including detecting relevant comments/sentences discussing ADEs [1,24], extracting event mentions
[20,21], and identifying ADEs from other semantic types between extracted drugs and event mentions [10,12].
Detecting credible and relevant ADE-related posts on social media is
crucial with the fact that only a small amount of posts describe ADEs.
Sarker and Gonzales [1] applied a supervised learning approach via
exploring various deep linguistic and semantic features. Yang et al. [24]
built an early warning system by leveraging the Latent Dirichlet Allocation and a partially supervised learning method. Moreover, several
studies aimed to identify drug users [9] or posts that discuss real patient
experiences [10,17].
With respect to the event mention extraction, the predominantly
adopted method is lexicon-based approach that identiﬁes ADEs using a
list of precompiled ADE mentions [8–10,12,17,18,23,27,28]. The investigated knowledge bases mainly include UMLS (United Medical
Language System) (http://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/) – a metathesaurus encompassing a large collection of health and biomedical
vocabularies [8,10,12,17], FAERS – a database designed to support
FDA’s post-marketing drug safety surveillance [10,12], CHV (Consumer
Health Vocabulary) (http://www.consumerhealthvocab.org/) that
contains words and phrases from lay persons [10,12,23], MedDRA
(http://www.meddra.org/) – a Medical terminology Dictionary for
Regulatory Activities [18,28], and SIDER (Side Eﬀect Resource)
(http://sideeﬀects.embl.de/) [8], etc. With the availability of annotated
corpora recently, supervised learning approaches have advanced this
line of research by exploring various features [20,21,29], especially
word embedding features [20,29] and sentiment analysis features [21].
Considering the fact that extracted event mentions may also describe other semantic types (e.g., drug indications and beneﬁcial effects), some studies focused on distinguishing the relations between
drugs and extracted event mentions. In the early years of this research,
co-occurrence method, which asserts the ADE relation if a drug and an
event are mentioned simultaneously, was widely used [18,23,27].
Moreover, Leaman et al. [8] implemented a rule-based ﬁltering method
to remove other relation types. However, co-occurrence and rule-based
methods generally suﬀer from low precision and low recall, respectively. In recent years, statistical machine learning-based approaches,
including kernel-based and feature-based methods, are gaining increasing attention for addressing this task. For example, Liu and Chen
[10] developed a hybrid approach that used the shortest dependency
path kernel-based method for relation detection and rule-based semantic ﬁltering method for relation classiﬁcation. Several rules were
generated to ﬁlter instances that described drug indications and negated adverse drug events. Segura-Bedmar et al. [28] used the Shallow
Linguistic (SL) kernel and distant supervision method, in which no
annotated data is required. Liu et al. [12] proposed an ensemble
method that combined four kernels (the subset tree kernel, tree kernel,
shortest dependency path kernel, and all-paths graph kernel) and a
feature-based method that leveraged various lexical, syntactic, and semantic features.

learner, an ensemble method’s generalization ability is usually much
stronger, if two necessary conditions, i.e., accuracy and diversity, are
satisﬁed [16]. Accuracy means that component base learners are more
accurate than random guessing; diversity means that the decision
boundary of each base learner is diﬀerent from those of others [30]. In
general, diversity of base learners can be attained by manipulating instances, manipulating features, and using diﬀerent training algorithms
or parameters, etc. Random subspace is a well-known feature partitioning method [31]. In random subspace, several feature subspaces are
constructed by randomly sampling from the original feature space;
then, a ﬁnal decision is made by combining a set of base learners that
are obtained in these random subspaces [13].
Several prior studies have advanced the line of random subspacerelated research by deﬁning new feature subspace generation mechanism, instead of the completely random manner. Yaslan and
Cataltepe [32] proposed a Rel-RASCO (relevant random subspace Cotraining) method that aimed to select relevant features based on their
mutual information. Koziarski et al. [33] produced feature subspaces in
a guided manner that simultaneously considered both diversity of all
subspaces and the quality of each subspace. Moreover, stratiﬁed sampling was also adopted to ameliorate the random subspace method
[14,15,31,34]. Speciﬁcally, the feature set was partitioned into several
feature subsets (called feature strata) in some way; each feature subspace used to train a base learner was composed of features randomly
sampled from each feature stratum. For example, in POS-RS proposed
in [31], feature strata consisted of content word subspace and function
word subspace, which were generated based on part-of-speech (POS)
information. Therefore, POS-RS restricts the choice of features to lexical
words since it requires features to have POS information. Each feature
stratum in Liu et al. [34] for writeprint identiﬁcation was the individual-author feature set (IAFS) for each author. This study is speciﬁcally tailored to the writeprint identiﬁcation problem. Jing et al. [14]
clustered features into several feature groups. In Ye et al. [15], two
feature strata were composed of strong informative features and weak
informative features respectively.

of the sentence suﬃciently [39,40]. Second, deep syntactic parser could
be susceptible to the noise, grammatical mistakes, and representational
complexities associated with patient-generated content in social media
[28].
Before the feature engineering, we conduct tokenization and POS
tagging using Stanford Parser (http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/lexparser.shtml). Moreover, we perform stop word removal and special
character replacement (e.g., numbers - > D). The shallow linguistic
feature set is composed of four categories, i.e., token, POS, the relative
position of drug and event entities, and overlap information. Token and
POS features explore the context information – N tokens surrounding
(N = 3), and all tokens between, the drug and event entities. Unigrams,
bigrams, and trigrams of these tokens and corresponding POSs are included.
Semantic features include indicators of other relation types and
UMLS semantic types. Other relation types include drug indication,
negated adverse drug event, and prevention. Some examples of user
posts describing diﬀerent relation types are listed in Fig. 1. Drug indication indicates that the disorder or symptom is the condition for
which the drug is prescribed or taken. We identify this relation by
matching drug/event pairs in a relation instance with drug/indication
pairs in FAERS. Negated adverse drug event means that an event that the
patient considers negative does not occur. NegEx [41], a linguistic rulebased natural language processing system, is utilized to identify negations. Prevention suggests that the drug can prevent the occurring of the
event. In this study, we customize some rules to identify the prevention
relationship. The algorithm that assigns values to these features is
presented in Fig.2.
UMLS concepts can be abstracted into 135 semantic types. The
UMLS semantic types can be recognized using MetaMap (https://
metamap.nlm.nih.gov/). The terms identiﬁed by matching with CHV
are labeled as “chv”. For example, the semantic type of “Coumadin” is
[orch, phsu], therefore, its semantic type features are orch_drug and
phsu_drug. The semantic type of “fast heart rate”, a consumer-preferred
term of “tachycardia” is labeled as “chv”.

A novel random subspace method for identifying adverse drug
events from social media

2.4. The stratiﬁed sampling-based random subspace method
As discussed earlier, it seems that random subspace is especially
suitable for social media-based
ADE identiﬁcation, since random subspace performs well when
there are many redundant and irrelevant features, which is the case
with social media-based ADE identiﬁcation. However, the random
subspace method can cause considerable discrepancy between the data
sets in generated feature subspace and that in the original feature space
for high-dimensional data [14]. This situation is exacerbated by two
characteristics of features for ADE identiﬁcation. First, there exists
serious number imbalance between the explored feature groups, i.e.,
the feature number of the shallow linguistic feature set is far greater
than that of the semantic feature set. Second, each feature group can
represent one general aspect (i.e., morphological aspect and semantic
aspect respectively) of an instance, providing complementary insights
of data for learning. In order to maintain the characteristics of original
data set as close as possible, an improved random subspace method is
proposed by using stratiﬁed sampling mechanism rather than using
totally random sampling when constructing feature subspaces. Stratiﬁed sampling is a sampling technique that is able to adequately capture
key population characteristics [14,15]. When performing stratiﬁed
sampling, two steps are taken: dividing the population into smaller
subgroups called strata; then applying random sampling to each subgroup or stratum.
Fig. 3 outlines the scheme of our proposed stratiﬁed sampling-based
random subspace method (SSRS) for ADE identiﬁcation. The pseudocode for the SSRS method is shown in Fig. 4. The SSRS method, which
performs stratiﬁed sampling for feature subspace selection, works as
follows. Firstly, the original feature space F is divided into two disjoint

Following several prior studies [12,35], we treat the problem of
identifying ADEs from other semantic types as a relation extraction
task. Speciﬁcally, we focus on identifying the type of relation that holds
between pre-recognized drug/event pairs. Speciﬁcally, given an instance indicating a drug/event pair, we classify it as either positive (i.e.,
the pair describes an ADE relation) or negative (i.e., the pair describes
other semantic types or no relation holds between the pair). For example, in the sentence “I was put on beta blockers [Drug Entity] at one
time for high bp [Event Entity] and I was so fatigue [Event Entity] I
couldn't do anything.”, we classify the pair (beta blockers, high bp) as
negative, while classify the pair (beta blockers, fatigue) as positive. In
this section, we ﬁrst describe features representing an instance, and
then describe our proposed stratiﬁed sampling-based random subspace
method in detail.
2.3. Feature extraction
Two groups of features, i.e., shallow linguistic features and semantic
features, are explored, mainly out of two considerations. On one hand,
for relation extraction, shallow linguistic features encode lots of discriminative clues [28,36–38], providing a strong performance baseline.
On the other hand, for ADE identiﬁcation, previous studies have veriﬁed the usefulness of semantic features that use domain knowledge
[1,10]. The two categories of features describe instances from diﬀerent
aspects, and thus can complement each other. Deep syntactic features
are not included in this study for the following reasons. First, derived
deep syntactic-based features could fail to capture syntactic structures

shallow linguistic rate, while semantic subspace rate has an important
impact on the accuracy of base learners. Suppose the computational
complexity for training a base learner is , the computional complexity
of random subspace is roughly T (O (m) + O (s )) , where m denotes the
number of instances, T is the number of base learners, O (s ) denotes the
computational complexity for selecting features. The computational
complexity of our proposed SSRS is roughly the same as that of conventional random subspace since the SSRS method uses natural formed
strata, i.e., diﬀerent categories of features. Compared with other eﬀorts
on improving the random subspace method using cluster-based [14] or
relevance-based stratum creation method [15], the SSRS method can
reduce the computational complexity.

feature subsets (strata) F1 and F2 . Secondly, at each iteration, randomly
sample features from each stratum and then merge them to form a
feature subspace that is used to construct a base learner. In the context
of ADE identiﬁcation, shallow linguistic features form a core stratum,
and semantic features form another stratum. Finally, majority voting is
adopted to consolidate the predictions of T base learners. With respect
to the number of features sampled from each stratum, we introduce
feature subspace rates k1 and k2 for the two strata respectively, i.e.,
shallow linguistic subspace rate and semantic subspace rate in this
study. The two parameters can simultaneously control the diversity and
the accuracy of base learners. Speciﬁcally, the randomness injection
that ensures diversity among base learners is primarily rely on the

steps: data downloading and data parsing. We download data from
discussion forums using an automatic web crawler and parse out speciﬁc ﬁelds from raw HTML pages using a developed regular expressionbased parser. We built a test bed that encompassed posts from MedHelp
(http://www.medhelp.org/), a well-known online health community.
There are more than 12 million users that are involved in medical related discussions or information seeking each month on MedHelp since
its inception in 1994 [23]. The boards on MedHelp are organized by
diﬀerent diseases. We collected eight heart disease-related discussion
boards between January 1995 and January 2014, as shown in Table 1.
To build the gold standard corpus, we randomly selected relation
instances from the sentences that contain both drug and event entities.
Two capable post-graduate students were required to annotate these
instances under the supervision of a medical domain expert, following
the annotation guidelines in [10]. If the ADE relation holds between the
drug and event entities in an instance, the instance was labeled as a
positive example; otherwise, the instance was labeled as a negative

To evaluate the eﬀectiveness of our proposed method for ADE
identiﬁcation from social media, we applied the SSRS method in a case
study on heart disease discussion forums. Heart disease is a prevalent
chronic disease, which leads to approximately 630,000 deaths and
$200 billion costs in the United States each year [42]. Patients with
heart disease are especially vulnerable to ADEs, mainly because of their
advanced age, multimorbidity and polypharmacy. Timely detection of
patient-perceived ADEs is critical to enhance drug safety and wellbeing
among patients with heart disease. Following the prior study [10], the
framework is shown in Fig.5.

and event mentions by resorting to several knowledge bases, including
UMLS, FAERS, and CHV. First, Metamap, a tool maintained by National
Library of Medicine, is conﬁgured for recognizing UMLS concepts that
belong to speciﬁc semantic groups in text. Among the 15 semantic
groups that UMLS contains, we only consider “Chemical and Drugs”
group for drug entity recognition and “Disorders” semantic group for
event mention recognition. Second, terms that never appear in FAERS
are ﬁltered out to avoid introducing excessive false positives. Third, in
general, consumers prefer to use non-standard terms, creative phrases,
and descriptive symptom expressions, to describe adverse drug events.
Therefore, to reduce the number of false negatives, our custom medical
dictionary is augmented by incorporating corresponding consumerpreferred terms in CHV.
To evaluate the eﬀectiveness of the lexicon-based method, randomly selected 600 sentences are annotated by two capable postgraduate students. A medical domain expert is consulted to resolve the
label disagreements. In this process, 321 drugs and 343 event mentions
are annotated. We obtain an f -measure of 87.33% and 76.16% for drug
entity extraction and event entity extraction, respectively. Considering
that ADEs often appear in the text that contains drug/event pairs [10],
sentences that contain both drug entity and event entity are selected for
further analysis.

was 0.737, which implies signiﬁcant agreement. Finally, annotation

3.2. Data preprocessing
This component (the focus of this study) aims to identify ADEs from
other semantic types. In total, 8059 features are explored in our dataset
– including 8035 shallow linguistic features, and 24 semantic features.
The number of features in each group (i.e., numbers in parentheses) and
some examples of extracted features are shown in Table 2. Features
representing an example instance are listed in Table 3.
We have described the reasons for selecting features in Section 3.1.
To further discuss and verify the reasonability of explored feature
groups, in this section, we used information gain (IG) as the measure to
analyze the discriminative information carried by diﬀerent feature
groups. Table 4 presents the top 30 most discriminative features (i.e.,
features with high IG values). As shown in Table 4, each feature group

Data preprocessing includes conducting case-folding, removing
personally identiﬁable information, URLs, and duplicated punctuations
using regular expressions, as well as segmenting each post into sentences using OpenNLP (http://opennlp.apache.org/), which means that
we extract ADEs within a sentence, rather than across sentences.
3.3. Medical entity extraction
Medical entity recognition is a prerequisite for conducting ADE
identiﬁcation. A recent work has revealed that lexicon-based method is
predominant [44]. Following our recent work [12], we extract drugs

AdaBoostM1 module, and the Random Subspace module in WEKA, respectively. For the SSRS method, it was implemented in Eclipse using
WEKA Package, i.e., WEKA.JAR. The source code may be obtained from
the authors upon request. Among the compared existing ADE identiﬁcation methods, the tree kernel, subset tree kernel, and shortest dependency kernel were implemented using SVMlight (http://www.cs.
cornell.edu/People/tj/svm_light/) package. In the experiments, except
when stated otherwise, all the default parameters were used. In this
section, we report our experimental results and provide detailed discussions, including statistical analysis, sensitivity analysis, and performance comparison with several existing ADE identiﬁcation eﬀorts.

that is explored in this study carries important information for ADE
identiﬁcation, verifying the reasonability of selecting these features.
4. Experimental setup and results
4.1. Performance evaluation
We used the average accuracy, a standard machine learning evaluation metric, to evaluate the performance of all involved methods.
The deﬁnition of average accuracy can be explained using the confusion
matrix shown in Table 5. Average accuracy is the proportion of examples that are correctly classiﬁed, i.e., average accuracy=(TP + TN)/
(TP + FP + TN + FN). Besides, given that the dataset is imbalanced in
our experiments, we used the area under the curve (AUC) of ROC
(Receiver Operating Characteristics) as an additional evaluation metric,
since it is invariant to the class distribution of the training set [45].
4.2. Experimental procedure
To verify the eﬀectiveness of our proposed SSRS method, a series of
experiments were conducted. We divided the compared methods into
two groups:
other ensemble learning methods including Bagging,
Boosting, and Random Subspace;
existing ADE identiﬁcation
methods, including co-occurrence, tree kernel, subset tree kernel,
shortest dependency path kernel, and the hybrid method proposed in
[10]. For all ensemble learning methods and our proposed SSRS
method, we compared two base learning algorithms, i.e., Support
Vector Machine (SVM) and Naïve Bayes (NB). SVM was chosen since it
was predominantly applied in prior ADE-related studies [1,10,20]. NB
was selected due to its computational eﬃciency as well as its relatively
good performance in text classiﬁcation [46]. Moreover, all ensemble
learning methods and the proposed SSRS method were applied on three
feature sets, i.e., shallow linguistic feature set (labeled “F1″), semantic
feature set (labeled “F2″), and the merged feature set (labeled
“F1 + F2″). All existing ADE identiﬁcation methods were re-implemented on our dataset.
To minimize the inﬂuence of variability in the training set, 10-fold
cross validation was performed ten times on the datasets. In detail, each

4.3. Experimental results
Table 6 shows the experimental results. The best performance values are boldfaced, and values following “+” denote standard deviations.
As shown in Table 6, our proposed SSRS method obtains the highest
average accuracy of 81.72% and AUC of 83.75% when using SVM as the
base learning algorithm, followed by the random subspace method that
is applied on the merged feature set (F1 + F2). When using all features,
random subspace outperforms other ensemble learning methods; t-test
shows that the improvements of the random subspace over baselines,
Bagging, and Boosting are statistically signiﬁcant (p < 0.05) (see
Table 7). Compared with SSRS, Bagging generally suﬀers from highdimensionality; Boosting is vulnerable to noisy data; the eﬀectiveness of
random subspace is limited by the huge diﬀerence in the number of
features in F1 and F2.

be that Naive Bayes has strict assumptions of independence among
features [47], which is hard to be satisﬁed in the social media environment.

We highlight the strengths of the SSRS method as follows. First,
shallow linguistic information and the semantic information are simultaneously explored. The experimental results reveal the superiority
of using the two groups of features over a single group of features in all
cases, suggesting that these two sets of features can describe data from
diﬀerent aspects, and therefore, can compensate each other. Second,
the strong generalization capability of the SSRS method beneﬁts from
the stratiﬁed sampling-based feature subspace selection strategy, whose
validity is veriﬁed by the experimental results that SSRS delivers improved average accuracy and AUC over the conventional random subspace that is performed on the merged feature set (F1 + F2). The main
reasons can be summed up as two points: reduced discrepancy between
the generated data subsets and original data set as well as greater
possibility of covering more informative semantic features. We conducted paired t-tests to compare the performance of our proposed SSRS
method against other ensemble methods (see Table 7). The t-test results
indicate that the proposed SSRS method signiﬁcantly outperformed
other methods on AUC with almost all p-values less than 0.05 (only
except the case of RS on all features, i.e., F1 + F2, when using NB as the
base learning algorithm).
In terms of the base learning algorithm, SVM outperforms NB in
most of cases, verifying the superiority of SVM in addressing high-dimensional data. This ﬁnding suggests that Naive Bayes is not suitable to
address social media-based pharmacovigilance. The main reason may

4.4. Sensitivity analysis
For conventional random subspace, sensitivity analysis is conducted
by varying the subspace rate, an important parameter in random subspace, from 0.1 to 0.9 with an interval of 0.1. Fig. 6 presents the AUC
curve when using diﬀerent sets of features, i.e., shallow linguistic features (F1), semantic features (F2), and combined features (F1 + F2),
respectively. As shown in the ﬁgure, when random subspace uses SVM
as the base learning algorithm and is performed on feature sets that
have many irrelevant and redundant features, the AUC value is ﬁrst
increased and then decreased along with the increasing of the subspace
rate. The AUC curves reach the peak when the subspace rate is 0.4 on
F1 and 0.5 on F1 + F2. The results are consistent with prior research
that recommends the subspace rate to be set to 0.5 [13]. It is noteworthy that on low-dimensional feature set (F2), random subspace with
NB as the base learning algorithm outperforms that with SVM as the
base learning algorithm when the subspace ratio is lower than 0.3.
Diﬀerent from the conventional random subspace method, SSRS
uses two subspace rates, i.e., shallow linguistic subspace rate (k1) and
semantic subspace rate (k2 ). Fig. 7 shows the AUC values of SVM and NB

under diﬀerent k1 and k2 . SSRS with SVM as the base learning algorithm
obtains the highest AUC when k1 = 0.4 and k2 = 0.7 , and SSRS with NB
as the base learning algorithm obtains the highest AUC when k1 = 0.6
and k2 = 0.5.

4.5. Performance comparison with existing approaches
We compare the proposed SSRS method with several existing approaches, including co-occurrence, hybrid method proposed in [10],
and three kernel-based methods, i.e., tree kernel, subset tree kernel, and
shortest dependency path kernel investigated in [12]. Co-occurrence
approach assumes that if two entities are frequently mentioned simultaneously, they are somehow related [48]. Co-occurrence is simple
to implement, but it may generate many false positives. Tree kernel
utilizes the syntax tree representations of relation instances [49]. It
computes two parse trees’ similarity by considering parent nodes’ similarity and their children’s similarity. Subset tree kernel is a convolution kernel that computes the similarity of two syntax trees by calculating the number of common sub-trees [50]. In the subset tree kernel,
either none or all of a tree node’s children must be contained in the
resulting substructure. Shortest dependency path kernel [51] hypothesizes
that shortest dependency paths derived from instances carry the most
important information. The hybrid method in [10] combines shortest
dependency path kernel for relation detection and rule-based semantic
ﬁltering method for relation classiﬁcation. The abovementioned kernelbased methods do not require explicit feature engineering, however,
they are unable to make use of discriminative domain-related knowledge. We conducted paired t-tests to compare the performance of our
proposed SSRS method against existing ADE identiﬁcation methods (see
Table 8). The t-test results show that the SSRS method signiﬁcantly

4.6. Analysis of extracted ADEs from social media
We analyze atenolol-related ADEs that are extracted from social
media using diﬀerent methods. We select atenolol, a medication that is
used to treat hypertension (high blood pressure), as the example since it
is widely discussed in instances that are predicted as positive ADE in
our whole data set. To compare ADEs extracted using diﬀerent
methods, we respectively list the top 10 most discussed ADEs identiﬁed
by applying SVM, SDP, and SSRS. As shown in Fig.8, the three lists are
not exactly the same, but share many common items, such as “fatigue”,
“dizziness”, “depression”, “faint”, and “tiredness”. Eﬀorts on enhancing
the predictive performance of ADE identiﬁcation methods are necessary
since enhanced ADE identiﬁcation capability can increase the credibility of extracted ADEs. For example, “blood_pressure” identiﬁed

using SVM might be false positives, i.e, non-ADEs falsely predicted as
ADEs. As shown in Fig.8, most of forum reports are discussing mild
ADEs, such as “fatigue” and “dizziness”. Although these ADEs are not
serious, life-threatening, or fatal, the minor ADEs could aﬀect quality of
life and lead to drug non-compliance.

Summary points

5. Conclusions and future directions

• Social media-based adverse drug event (ADE) identiﬁcation

The public health big data has opened up new opportunities for
pharmacovigilance. In this study, we simultaneously explored shallow
linguistic features and medical knowledge base-driven semantic features. A novel stratiﬁed sampling-based random subspace method,
SSRS, was proposed. A series of experiments were conducted to evaluate the eﬀectiveness of abovementioned features and the SSRS
method. The experimental results reveal that: ﬁrst, among several ensemble learning methods, random subspace is suitable to address the
problem of social-media ADE identiﬁcation; second, our proposed SSRS
method signiﬁcantly outperform other compared ensemble methods as
well as existing social media-based ADE identiﬁcation approaches.
This study has implications for both practitioners and research
community. The high-performing social media-based ADE identiﬁcation has great potential to eﬀectively augment current passive systems
and provide regulatory authorities with decision aids, help support
patient empowerment, and achieve data-driven medication safety
management. For research, the proposed SSRS method is easy to implement since it is based on two feature sets that can be naturally derived and be always available in the context of social media-based ADE
identiﬁcation, and therefore, can omit artiﬁcial stratum generation efforts and be universally applicable to extract ADEs from social media.
SSRS has great potential of being applied to deal with other high-dimensional problems that can represent original data from two diﬀerent
aspects, especially when a large number of irrelevant and redundant
features exist. For instance, in web page classiﬁcation problem, features
can be partitioned into two groups, i.e., the words occurring on that
page, as well as the words in hyperlinks pointing to that page. The
proposed SSRS method can also be extended to more than two strata,
with minimal eﬀort of adjusting the mechanism that determines the
number of features sampled from each stratum.
In the future, we plan to explore other viable stratiﬁed sampling
strategies for enhanced ADE identiﬁcation capability. Moreover, we
plan to perform semi-supervised learning to make use of the unlabeled
data in social media.

has great potential to augment current eﬀorts and provide
regulatory authorities with valuable decision aids.
Automated identiﬁcation of ADEs from social media is
challenging due to the intrinsic characteristics of social
media data, such as abundance of misspellings, novel/creative phrases, abbreviations, and colloquial terms. We veriﬁed the eﬀectiveness of random subspace, which is suitable
but under-examined in the context of social media-based
ADE identiﬁcation.
The number distribution of features between explored two
complementary feature categories is severely imbalanced,
which restricts the performance of random subspace to some
extent. Therefore, in line with this characteristic, we proposed an improved random subspace method, called
Stratiﬁed Sampling-based Random Subspace (SSRS), speciﬁcally for ADE identiﬁcation from social media. SSRS used
the stratiﬁed sampling for feature subspace selection instead
of the random sampling strategy in conventional random
subspace.
A case study on heart disease discussion forums was conducted to evaluate the eﬀectiveness of the SSRS method.
Experimental results revealed that the proposed SSRS
method signiﬁcantly outperformed other compared ensemble methods and existing approaches for ADE identiﬁcation.
