Abstract
Purpose A Bayesian confidence propagation neural network (BCPNN) is a signal detection method used by the
World Health Organization Uppsala Monitoring Centre to analyze spontaneous reporting system databases. We
modify the BCPNN to increase its sensitivity for detecting potential adverse drug reactions (ADRs).
Method In a BCPNN, the information component (IC) is defined as an index of disproportionality between the observed
and expected number of reported drugs and events. Our proposed method adjusts the IC value by borrowing information
about events that have occurred in drugs defined as similar to the target drug. We compare the performance of our
method with that of a traditional BCPNN through a simulation study.
Results The false positive rate of the proposed method was lower than that of the traditional BCPNN method and close
to the nominal value, 0.025, around the true difference in ICs between the target drug and similar drugs equal to 0. The
sensitivity of the proposed method was much higher than that of the traditional BCPNN method in case in which the
difference in ICs between the target drug and similar drugs ranges from 0 to 2. When applied to a database managed by
Japanese regulatory authority, the proposed method could detect known ADRs earlier than the traditional method.
Conclusions The proposed method is a novel criterion for early detection of signals if similar drugs have the same tendencies. The
proposed BCPNN tends to have higher sensitivity when the true difference is greater than 0.

During the development of a new drug, most clinical trials
focus on the drug’s efficacy; the limited number of patients
treated in these trials is usually insufficient to fully evaluate
the drug’s safety. Spontaneous reporting systems are one appropriate approach evaluating drug safety after a medication’s
launch, and are typically maintained by regulatory authorities
and pharmaceutical companies to continue to collect drug
safety information. In addition to the Uppsala Monitoring
Centre (UMC) and Food and Drug Administration (FDA), a
Japanese regulatory authority, the Pharmaceuticals and
Medical Devices Agency (PMDA) has also begun collecting
such information and shared a database from 2004, called the
Japanese Adverse Drug Event Report database (JADER).
Due to the increase in the information obtained, quantitative signal detection methods have become useful for detecting the relationship between a drug and a suspected adverse
drug reaction (ADR). Many methods, such as reporting odds

ratio (ROR) [1], proportional reporting rate (PRR) [2],
Bayesian confidence propagation neural network (BCPNN)
[3], and multi-item gamma Poisson shrinker (mGPS) [4], have
been proposed and used in some organizations for this purpose. The basic strategies of these methods are similar: to
assess disproportionality in the expected and observed counts
for specific combinations of drugs and suspected ADRs.
Although many studies have aimed to compare the performances of these methods [5–13], there is still no gold standard
method agreed upon worldwide.
Quantitative signal detection can be used for screening, in which case medical experts must review the
details after signals are detected. Therefore, high sensitivity is an important property for quantitative signal
detection methods. Although BCPNN is a quantitative
signal detection method that is routinely used by the
UMC to detect signals, its lower sensitivity compared
with methods such as ROR has been pointed out in
previous researches [5, 8]. Norén et al. have proposed
an improved BCPNN [14] that is especially useful for
rare events, but the increase in its sensitivity has not
been clarified. In this study, we propose an approach
to increase the sensitivity of BCPNNs using reports of
similar drugs.

Methods
Traditional BCPNN and information component [3]
In spontaneous reporting systems, multiple drugs and
suspected ADRs are included in each report. The information
can generally be summarized as a 2 × 2 contingency table as in
Table 1 for applying quantitative signal detections methods.
nD, nD+, nT, and nT+ indicate the number of pairs of a target
drug and a specific event (i.e., a suspected ADR) included in
the same report, the number of all events reported with the
target drug, the number of the specific event reported with any
drugs, and the number of all events reported with any drugs,
respectively.

The information component (IC) is defined as an index of disproportionality between an observed and expected number of specific events reported in the target
drug in a BCPNN. The raw IC comes from the base 2
logarithm of the observed-to-expected ratio, defined in
Eq. (1).

Assume that three random variables, nD, nT, and nD+ , follow binomial distributions and that p1, p2, and p3 follow beta
distributions as priors. p1, p2, and p3 can be interpreted as
relative reporting rates based on nT+. Bi(n, p) indicates a
binomial distribution with a parameter p and Be(α, β) indicates a beta distribution with parameters α and β as fixed
values.

Based on the definition of raw IC, the IC parameter in the

Proposed method
Definition of similar drugs
The number of a specific event reported in a target drug (nD) is
often very small in practice, especially for rare events or recently launched drugs. In such cases, because there is so little
information that we can utilize, traditional BCPNNs would
rarely be capable of early signal detection. To address this
issue, we utilize the reports of similar drugs to increase the
amount of available information. Here, a similar drug is defined as a drug that has similar pharmacological mechanisms
of action to the target drug. The target drug and similar drugs
are generally categorized in the same drug class. Standardized
drug groupings (SDGs) [16] managed by UMC are the transparent criteria for classifying drugs as similar. For example,
drugs categorized as gliptins such as sitagliptin and
vildagliptin are known to inhibit the activation of dipeptidyl
peptidase-4 (DPP-4). We assume that similar drugs have a
close relative reporting rate to that of the target drug. If the
signal for a specific event is detected in similar drugs, we
consider that there may be a similar signal in the target drug.
Extending BCPNNs to borrow the information from similar
drugs
In our method, a 3 × 2 contingency table—in which a row for
similar drugs is added to Table 1—is applied to detect signals
(see Table 2).

drug and all drugs in the proposed method.

To borrow the information from similar drugs defined according to the “Definition of similar drugs” section, as well as
the target drug, a random variable of the total of the number of
the specific event reported in similar drugs, nS, and the IC for
the similar drugs, denoted as raw ICsim are defined as follows:
nS ∼BiðnSþ


nS =nSþ
Raw ICsim ¼ log2
nT =nTþ
Borrowing information about similar drugs may too
strongly influence signal detection for the target drug, especially when nS is much larger than nD; in this case, the
borrowed information should be discounted. A large value
of nS can be also caused when many drugs are defined as
similar, because nS is the total number of the reported several
similar drugs. A power prior is widely used, for example in
clinical trials, to discount information from other clinical trials
[17]. It can manipulate amount of the borrowed information
by exponentiating likelihood that indicates historical data
from 0 to 1. We call this a conditional power prior if any
distribution is not assumed for parameter a of the power prior.

The role of a1 is to downsize nS+, the total number
of events reported in similar drugs to nD+, and the total
number of events reported in the target drug. Because
the number of the kind of similar drugs differs across
drug class, a1 can adjust an appropriate size. The role
of a2 is a key in the proposed method. a2 is based on a
sigmoid function and can mediate the amount of information that is borrowed. We define similar as the absolute value of the difference between the ICs of the target drug and the similar drugs. The closer the ICs become, the more the target drug borrows information
from the similar drugs, since parameter a increases.
b0 = − log 99 and b1 = log 99 are set in the proposed
method to accept borrowed information until the difference between raw IC and raw ICsim becomes 2. Finally,

Given the characteristics of the proposed method,
E[π(ICpro| nT+, nT, nD+, nD, nS+, nS)] is expected to move
from E[π(ICtra| nT+, nT, nD+, nD)] to raw ICsim, so its value
may increase or decrease, whereas V[π(ICpro| nT+, n T,
n D+ , n D , n S+ , n S )] is always theoretically lower than
V[π(IC tra | n T+ , n T , n D+ , n D )] (see Figure S1 in Online
resource). Therefore, if focusing only on the part of variances, the sensitivity of the proposed method is expected
to be higher than that of the traditional method since

Simulation study
Data generation
To evaluate the performance of the proposed method described in the “Proposed method” section, we ran a Monte
Carlo simulation of 10,000 trials. In the simulation, we compared the sensitivity and false positive rate of the traditional
and proposed BCPNN methods. The false positive rate and
sensitivity are defined as the proportions of incorrectly and
correctly detected signals, respectively, in the number of trials.
During data generation, the values of nD, nD+, nT, nS and nS+ in
Table 2 were independently generated by binomial distributions. Cases where nD = 0 were eliminated for calculating the
false positive rate and sensitivity. Let E[nD], the expectation of

the number of specific events reported in a target drug, be 3,
assuming rare events, an immature or small size of database
such as JADER. nT+, the number of all reports, is always fixed
to 1,000,000. To calculate the false positive rate, E[IC] = 0;
likewise, to calculate the sensitivity, E[IC] = 0.5, 1, 1.5, and 2.
Either E[nD+] or E[nT] was set to 1000 as 2 patterns. In case
E[nD+] = 1000, E[nT] is calculated by Eq. (3), depending on
E[IC]. For the number of similar drugs, we prepared 2 patterns, namely E[nS] = 90 and E[nS+] = 30,000. If one of them is
fixed, the other can be calculated, depending on E[IC] and
E[ICsim] (i.e., E[nS+] is calculated by Eq. (4), if E[nS] is fixed).
E[ICsim] is determined where −3 < E[ICsim] − E[IC] ≤ 3 by
0.2, considering the values of b0 and b1. All simulation settings are shown in the tables (Online resource).

Results
The false positive rate and sensitivity of the two methods
are shown in Figs. 1 and 2, respectively, where E[nD+] =
1000 and E[nS] = 90. The false positive rate and sensitivity of the traditional method in these figures are in parallel
to the horizontal axis because those indicate the difference
in IC between the target drug and similar drugs, and the
traditional method does not depend on the number of the
similar drugs. In Fig. 1, when the differences in IC between the target drug and the similar drugs is around 0,
the false positive rate of the proposed method is lower
than that of the traditional method and near to the nominal
value, 0.025. However, the false positive rate of the proposed method is higher than that of the traditional method
in case that the differences in IC between the target drug
and the similar drugs are between 0.5 and 2.5. These
situations are considered as the cases when the similar
drugs truly have relationship with the specific event, but
the target drug does not.

Sensitivity is shown in Fig. 2. In E[IC] = 0.5 and 1.5, the
sensitivity of the proposed method is higher than that of the
traditional method. Around − 2 to 0 in E[IC] = 1, the relationship between the similar drugs and the specific events affects
to sensitivity of the proposed method. In the case where E[IC]
= 2, the sensitivities of the proposed and traditional methods
were equally high. This would be the case that the signals are
strong enough to be detected even by the traditional BCPNN
when nD = 3.
All other results are shown in Tables S3-S5 with simulation
settings (Online resource) and indicate similar trends to the
results shown in Figs. 1 and 2.

Application
We applied the proposed method to JADER, which was released in 2004 and which is smaller than the UMC or FDA
spontaneous reporting databases. In JADER, more than 8000
kinds of drugs and 9000 kinds of preferred terms from the
Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA)
were reported until 2018. A 8000 × 9000 contingency table
can be developed using these data, although approximately
3.65% of the cells’ counts are not equal to 0 (in other words,
most of the counts in the contingency table are 0). In addition,
approximately three-fourths of the cells for which the counts
are not equal to 0 are less than 4. Even in UMC’s database,
more than 80% of cells’ counts are less than 11 [3].
We investigated the relationship between DPP-4 inhibitors
and rhabdomyolysis, which is a well-known ADR, as reported
in JADER, and thereafter applied the traditional, proposed
BCPNN and ROR methods [1] to the database. A summary
of the relationship with the results using these methods is
shown in Table 3. Nine drugs—alogliptin, anagliptin,
evogliptin, omarigliptin, linagliptin, saxagliptin, sitagliptin,
teneligliptin, and vildagliptin—and their combination products were defined as DPP-4 inhibitors [18] (trelagliptin and
gemigliptin are not included). In Japan, package inserts of
alogliptin, sitagliptin, and vildagliptin describe rhabdomyolysis as an ADR, though the relationship between the other
DPP-4 inhibitors and rhabdomyolysis is unreported. Relative
reporting rates are equal to the number of rhabdomyolysis

reported in each DPP-4 inhibitor divided by the number of all
suspected ADRs reported in the DPP-4 inhibitor. The raw IC
was derived using Eq. (1). The means ± 2 standard deviation
(SD) of the posterior IC were calculated using the methods
described in the “Methods” section (evogliptin and
omarigliptin were excluded because there was no report of
them in the database). The number of reports depended on
the drugs’ launch timing, but there seems to be no large difference in the relative reporting rates within DPP-4 inhibitors.
The SD that was calculated using the proposed method became less than that calculated using the traditional method,
whereas all drugs that were determined as signals using the
ROR method (lower limit of 95% CI > 1) were also detected
by both the traditional and proposed methods (mean – 2SD >
0). In addition, we showed the means ± 2SD of the posterior
IC calculated by the traditional and proposed methods, and
95% CI of the ROR method cumulatively by year in Fig. 3.
The tendencies of both the traditional and ROR methods are
similar, including the timing of the signal detection, whereas
in alogliptin and linagliptin, the posterior mean – 2SD of IC by
the proposed method was greater than 0 in 2014 and 2016,
respectively, while that by the traditional method was less than
0. This result can indicate that the proposed method has potential to detect earlier than the traditional method.

Discussion
To enhance the traditional BCPNN’s ability to detect a relationship between a drug and a suspected ADR from

spontaneous reporting database, we applied a power prior to
borrow the discounted information regarding similar drugs,
which increased the method’s sensitivity. The same approach
we introduced in this research can be applied not only to
BCPNNs but also to other methods based on a Bayesian
framework. In addition, the borrowed information could be
taken from a variety of sources—clinical trials, for example.
In judging the effectiveness of the proposed method, the
inherent tradeoff between sensitivity and false positive rate
should be considered. If the sensitivity increases, so will the
false positive rate. Altering the threshold for determining a
signal can change this balance. If the target drug has no relationship with a specific event and neither do similar drugs, the
number of reports can be correctly borrowed, lowering false
positive rate. On the other hand, it might be controversial
when a target drug has no relationship to a specific event,
but some similar drugs do. Can this result be called a false
positive? It might instead be a good opportunity to examine
the relationship between the drug and the event raised as a
signal. The balance between the sensitivity and false positive
rate of the proposed method can be changed by tuning b0 and
b1 in a2, although we consider the balance described in this
paper to be well-struck. Moreover, the shape of a2 can influence the method’s sensitivity and false positive rate. There is
no need to limit to a2 to a sigmoid function, though it is an
appropriately shaped function to express the relationship between similar and dissimilar drugs. The idea of applying a
function into the power parameters in a conditional power
prior may seem strange but novel. As a similar approach,
Bayesian hierarchical models have been proposed to analyze

Fig. 3 Mean ± 2SD of the posterior IC calculated by the traditional and
proposed methods, and the ROR method (95% Cis) by year for the DPP-4
inhibitors, a alogliptin, b anagliptin, c linagliptin, d saxagliptin, e
sitagliptin, f teneligliptin, and g vildagliptin, are shown. The relationship
between the ADR and the drug is determined as a signal if the mean - 2SD

> 0 in both the traditional and proposed BCPNN methods and/or the
lower limit of 95% CI of ROR > 1 in the ROR method. SD, standard

adverse events in clinical trials [19], but these methods are
relatively complicated for non-statisticians and timeconsuming for one analysis, besides, statistically dedicated
calculators required. Tremendous amounts of combinations
of a drug and a suspected ADR must be calculated in
pharmacovigilance. The proposed method allows us to detect
signals by using arithmetic calculations alone.
To decide which drugs should be included as similar to the
target drug, we referred to one paper for gliptin not to be
intentional in the application section. In the “Definition of
similar drugs” section, we defined a “similar drug” as “a drug
that has similar pharmacological mechanisms of action to the
target drug.” The proposed method would work well for earlier detection of the drug class–related ADRs because close
reporting rates of the ADRs are expected for each other among
similar drugs, and the closer the reporting rates are, the more

the proposed method can borrow the information from similar
drugs. This is supported by our simulation results. It would
also work well for the detection of disease-related events that
are not caused by the pharmacological mechanism of the action of the drugs, because the reporting rate of the events in a
drug would essentially be close to the rates among similar
drugs. However, detection of the disease-related events should
not be the primary purpose in signal detection analyses. In
contrast, the proposed method would be inappropriate for
the detection of drug-specific ADRs. Our simulation results
indicated that the false positive rate of the proposed method
increased from the traditional method in the case where the
difference in the IC between the target drug and similar drugs
was approximately 1–2, and the sensitivity of the proposed
method decreased from the traditional method in the case
where the IC of similar drugs was approximately 0, depending

Eur J Clin Pharmacol (2020) 76:1311–1319

on the IC of the target drug. This is a limitation of the proposed
method that defines a “similar drug” as “a drug that has similar
pharmacological mechanisms of action to the target drug” and
assumes that the similar drugs have close reporting rates of the
ADRs. In fact, users of the proposed method can define drug
similarity without restriction, at their own discretion to detect
new signals, then review the details and decide whether if the
event is truly an ADR. The mechanism of actions, pharmaceutical properties, or attributes of the drugs are all examples
for defining what is similar.
In conclusion, quantitative signal detection is a powerful
and efficient tool for investigating the relationship between a
target drug and a specific event. If a few events are reported in
the target drug, borrowing information from similar drugs can
be one option to support signal detection. Our proposed method has higher sensitivity than the traditional method, whereas
determining a signal using multiple methods is also important.
