Among the mechanisms responsible for cognitive dysfunction in chronic kidney disease (CKD) are albuminuria and oxidative stress. However, there may be other causes not yet identified. In fact, the full relevance of
CKD patient drug use and its relationship to dementia has hardly been barely investigated. We identified drugs
affecting cognitive function in CKD patients by analyzing the spontaneous reporting system in Japan using
Association rule mining (ARM) and Bayesian confidence propagation neural network (BCPNN). The signal
detection criterion used were as follows: case ≥ 3, lift > 1, conviction > 1 (ARM) and IC025 >0 (BCPNN). Drugs
with more than 20 cases were valaciclovir (lift: 11.21, conviction: 1.28, IC025: 3.12), amantadine (lift: 19.69, conviction: 1.68, IC025: 3.05), nalfurafine (lift: 8.35, conviction: 1.19, IC025: 2.18), pregabalin (lift: 6.05, conviction: 1.12,
IC025: 1.78), and acyclovir (lift: 5.89, conviction: 1.12, IC025: 1.68). This study is the first report to use a large-scale
medical database to identify drugs related to oral drugs-induced dementia in CKD.

1. Introduction
Rates of end stage kidney disease (ESKD) have increased worldwide and the number of dialysis patients is increasing rapidly.
Patients with ESKD have a significantly shorter life expectancy
than individuals without ESKD. Therefore, the rapid increase
in dialysis patients not only strains patients themselves but also
creates an economic burden to the healthcare system (Etgen et
al. 2012). Therefore, the goal of chronic kidney disease (CKD)
treatment is to reduce the incidence of ESKD by controlling CKD.
However, it has been reported that CKD patients may have cognitive function disorders (Seliger et al. 2004; Etgen et al. 2012;
Deckers et al. 2017). Declining cognitive function, including
dementia, decreases patient’s quality of life and increases the
burden on caregivers. Once developed, dementia is often irreversible, so its prevention is important. To provide effective and safe
medical care to CKD patients with various complications, it is
important to know drugs that affect their cognitive function.
CKD has been shown to be an important risk factor for the onset
of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and CVD death, but recently, an
association between CKD and dementia has also been reported
(Seliger et al. 2004; Etgen et al. 2012; Fujisaki et al. 2014; Deckers
et al. 2017). A clinical study on the association between CKD and
dementia in the US showed a 37% increase in dementia risk in
people aged 65 years or older with moderate renal dysfunction
(Seliger et al 2004).
Among the mechanisms of suggested to contribute to cognitive
dysfunction in CKD are albuminuria and oxidative stress. These
were verified by meta-analysis (Deckers et al. 2017) and animal
experiments in mice (Fujisaki et al. 2014). However, there may
be other causes that have not been clarified yet. For example, no
analysis has been made of a large-scale medical database to identify cognitive dysfunction caused by drugs used by CKD patients,
the full relevance of CKD patient’s drug use and its relationship to
dementia has been barely clarified. In CKD patients with a high

570

risk of dementia, understanding the effect of drugs on cognitive
function is an important issue for providing safe medical care.
For early detection of unknown drug induced adverse events
(AEs), signal detection based on disproportionality analysis has
generally been used.
As an indicator of signal detection, detection models using
frequency statistics include proportional reporting ratio (PRR)
(Evans et al. 2001) and reporting odds ratio (ROR) (Rothman et
al. 2004). As other detection models have information component (IC) given by Bayesian confidence propagation neural
network (BCPNN) (Bate et al. 1998) and empirical Bayes
geometric mean (EBGM) (Szarfman et al. 2002) using Bayesian
estimations.
While association rule mining (ARM) is a signal detection model
which considers drug interactions and primary disease, has been
reported to have a signal detection power equivalent to that of
disproportionality analysis, and is a simpler model (Noguchi et al.
2018a,b). Additionally, the signal detection by BCPNN is stable
even if the reported numbers are small. Therefore, to detect signals
of oral drug-induced dementia in CKD patients in a pharmacoepidemiologic model, we used ARM and BCPNN to analyze the
Japanese Adverse Drug Event Report (JADER) database as spontaneous reporting system in Japan.

2. Investigations and results
Table 1 shows the characteristics of CKD patients registered in
the JADER. The number of cases of CKD patients registered in
JADER was 28,817. Although, since JADER is based on spontaneous reporting, the number of CKD patients using drugs cannot
be clearly defined, among them, 1.33 % under the age of 60 were
reported to have developed drug-induced dementia, and 2.51 % of
patients over the age of 60 years. The report of males was 2.14 %
and that of females was 2.14 %.

1524 drugs were registered with adverse events in JADER, and
with a wide range search using ARM, 55 drugs were found to have
a signal of dementia in CKD patients (Table 2). Among them, the
drug whose signal was detected by BCPNN was 30 drugs.
Furthermore, among these 30 drugs, drugs with more than 20 cases
were valaciclovir (case: 174, lift: 11.21, conviction: 1.28, IC025:
3.12), amantadine (case: 33, lift: 19.69, conviction: 1.68, IC025:
3.05), nalfurafine (case: 31, lift: 8.35, conviction: 1.19, IC025: 2.18),
pregabalin (case: 29, lift: 6.05, conviction: 1.12, IC025: 1.78), and
acyclovir (case: 25, lift: 5.89, conviction: 1.12, IC025: 1.68).
In addition, among surveyed patients with dementia signals in the
wide range search of SMQ, signals of poor prognosis were detected
with the use of nalfurafine (case: 8, lift: 23.90, conviction: 1.05),
valaciclovir (case: 8, lift: 5.71, conviction: 1.01), amantadine (case: 5,
lift: 33.09, conviction: 1.07), sitagliptin (case: 3, lift: 8.96, conviction:
1.02), and pregabalin (case: 3, lift: 6.94, conviction: 1.01) (Table 3).
Dementia signal detection in a narrow range search identified
nalfurafine (case: 6, lift: 26.79, conviction: 1.03) and pregabalin
(case: 4, lift: 13.82, conviction: 1.01).

The number of cases of CKD patients registered in JADER was
28,817, which was 8.2 % of the total. JADER cannot calculate the
average age of enrolled patients because cases are registered for
every age of 10 years, but the distribution of reporting proportions
in each age was the same for males and females. Although, since
the database used is based on spontaneous reporting, the number
of CKD patients using drugs cannot be clearly defined, regardless
of sex, the reported proportion of CKD patients reporting cognitive function-related adverse events was highest in the age over
60 years.
Using the ARM, the apriori algorithm can be used to reduce the
number of calculations. The apriori algorithm is based on the principle that “support of a certain item set is always less than or equal
to support of its partial item set” (Agrawal and Srikant 1994). That
is, ARM omits calculation except for unreasonable combinations
among various combinations extracted from large database by
apriori algorithm, so there is a possibility that signals of various
conditions can be detected at an early stage (Noguchi et al. 2018a).
In our previous studies, ARM showed a sensitivity of 99 %, a
specificity of 94 %, and a Youden’s index of 0.94. Compared with
PRR of the conventional signal detection model, ARM has the
same degree of detectability despite a simple calculation model
(Noguchi et al. 2018a).
On the other hand, when the reported number is small, it is
predicted that signal detection by PRR based on the frequency-theoretic statistical model becomes unstable compared to BCPNN
based on the Bayesian statistical model. Therefore, in this study,
we first performed prescreening using ARM and used BCPNN as a
verification of the obtained signals.
In CKD patients, there were 55 drugs for which signals of cognitive function related adverse events included in the dementia wide
range search were detected using ARM, and 30 drugs of signals
using both ARM and BCPNN.
And of them, many were drugs classified as NERVOUS SYSTEM
(18 drugs) and ANTIINFECTIVES FOR SYSTEMIC USE (6
drugs) by the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) Classification System. The drugs with more than 20 cases were valaciclovir,
amantadine, nalfurafine and pregabalin. Furthermore, in the survey
on poor prognosis, signals of nalfurafine, valaciclovir, amantadine
and pregabalin were detected among the 4 drugs with more than
20 cases in the wide range search of dementia. Therefore, in this
paper, we will concentrate on these 4 drugs.
Valaciclovir is a prodrug of acyclovir with improved oral absorbability and which causes neuropsychiatric symptoms, namely
acyclovir encephalopathy.

Acyclovir encephalopathy produces a high rate of consciousness
disorders (Adair et al. 1994; Asahi et al. 2009), hallucinations (Asahi
et al. 2009), and involuntary movements (Adair et al. 1994), but
these symptoms are varied and non-specific (Rashiq et al. 1993). It
has been reported that an increase in concentration of acyclovir and
its metabolites (9-carboxymethoxymethylguanine) is involved in the
onset of symptoms (Helldén et al. 2003, 2006). Blood half-life of

572

acyclovir is several hours for subjects with normal renal function;
however, in renal failure patients, half-life extends to about 20 h.
This is also considered as a cause of side effects.
In healthy elderly patients, it was reported that memory function
under amantadine was significantly reduced in comparison to
treatment with trihexyphenidyl (McEvoy et al. 1987). Amantadine
is excreted in the urine largely unchanged, and accumulates in the

body when taken by a patient with reduced renal function. Moreover, high blood concentrations of amantadine are maintained even
after discontinuation. As a result, amantadine use in CKD patients
may possibly impair cognitive function.
Nalfurafine and pregabalin were detected as signals even when
limited to adverse events included in the dementia narrow range
search, and therefore may be drugs requiring special attention.
Nalfurafine is used for the treatment of pruritus in hemodialysis
patients. This compound has a particularly high affinity for the
opioid k receptor which is involved in hallucinations and delirium,
adverse effects that have also been reported in post-marketing
surveillance (Kozono et al. 2018).
Pregabalin, unlike benzodiazepines, is said to have no effect on g-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors, but is an analogue of GABA, an
inhibitory neurotransmitter (Bryans et al. 1999). Therefore, there is
a possibility that central inhibitory action may develop with its use.
The use of these drugs requires careful attention, such as observation of patient cognitive function over time.
A limitation to this study is that the medical database used is based
on spontaneous reports and, therefore, is influenced by reporting
bias (Pariente et al. 2007; Burkey et al. 2008). Such a drawback
cannot be solved by changing the analysis method from disproportionality analysis to ARM. In addition, since data on the grade of
CKD in patients do not exist on JADER, analysis by grade could not
be performed. Therefore, sufficient attention is required to interpret
the result on signals derived from using association analysis.
In signal detection using a spontaneous reporting system, the disproportionality measure between the drug registered as a suspected
drug and the adverse event report is used as a signal. Therefore,
this study cannot clarify the possibility that primary disease is the
cause of adverse events. Additionally, although confounding factors
related to dementia vary, the statistical models used in this study
cannot take into account anything other than CKD in either model.
This problem will need to be clarified in future research.
In conclusion, this study is the first report to use a large-scale medical
database to identify drugs related to drug-induced dementia in CKD

patients. In the search using ARM, signals (or signal candidates)
were easily obtained from large databases, from which BCPNN
properly detected the signals.
Although sufficient attention is required for interpretation of the results
obtained from spontaneous reporting, we considered that by avoiding
the use of drugs related to drug-induced dementia revealed in this report,
it is possible to help prevent the onset of dementia in CKD patients.
Until more detailed clinical research results are reported, the use of these
drugs requires observation of patient cognitive function over time.

4. Experimental
4.1. Data source
Authors do not own the data because the Japanese authority, Pharmaceuticals and
Medical Devices Agency (PMDA), does not permit sharing the Japanese Adverse
Drug Event Report database (JADER) directly. Data owned by PMDA can be
accessed directly here:
http://www.info.pmda.go.jp/fukusayoudb/CsvDownload.jsp (only in Japanese).
The JADER consists of four comma-separated values (csv) files as data tables:
DEMO.csv (table containing patient information), DRUG.csv (table containing
medicine information), HIST.csv (table including patient past history), and REAC.csv
(adverse event information table). The data sets were created by combining the identification numbers assigned to each of the four tables. In this study, data from patients
registered in JADER from April 2004 through June 2018 were used. However, reports
with missing information regarding sex, age, or primary disease, and where subjective
terms such as “youth” and “elderly” were used, were excluded from the analysis. For
this reason, 352,372 cases were used for analysis.

4.2. Definition of primary disease and adverse events
We investigated patients with CKD registered as a primary disease. The original
diseases registered in JADER are described in the preferred terms (PTs) of the
Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities/Japanese version (MedDRA/J). Therefore, the original diseases extracted were defined as PTs contained in chronic kidney
disease among standardized MedDRA queries (SMQ). The PTs included in the SMQ
included “narrow range” when searching for a case highly likely to indicate the state,
and “wide range” when it was necessary to detect all possible cases. In this study, all
172 PTs of wide range were used in the search.
The AE in this study was dementia. Therefore, among SMQ of MedDRA/J, PTs
included in dementia (SMQ 20000073) were defined as AEs to be investigated. In the

extraction of AEs, 90 PTs included in the wide range search and only 21 PTs included
only in narrow range search were used.
In addition, JADER includes the following outcome information on adverse events:
recovery, remission, no recovery, death, after-effects, and unknown. For PTs included
in the wide range search, signals with descriptions of either no recovery, death and
after-effects were analyzed as “poor prognosis adverse events”.

4.3. Data analysis
ARM is a simple analysis method for large databases, and appropriate signals can be
detected from many combinations by apriori algorithm. Therefore, in this study, we
first performed prescreening using ARM, and used BCPNN as a verification of the
obtained signals.
However, since the BCPNN cannot create a model for detecting signals of events with
multiple conditions attached to conclusion: Y like signals related to “poor prognosis adverse
events”, We performed on signals related to “poor prognostic dementia” using only ARM.

4.3.1. Signal detection using association rule mining
The calculation of lift and conviction are shown in Eqs. (1) and (2). The number of
reports required to calculate the lift (Fig.) is as, n111: Of CKD patients, the number of
cases that developed dementia using suspected drugs, n11+: Of CKD patients, total
number of cases of adverse events using suspected drug, n++1: Of CKD patients, Total
number of cases that developed dementia.
The “lift” of ARM used for signal detection in this research is an index showing the
relative magnitude of the probability of observing conclusion: Y (= dementia) under
the condition of premise: X (= suspect drug with CKD patients).
When the lift is 1.0, the 2 events (premise: X and conclusion: Y) are independent of
each other; when the lift is greater than 1.0, the events are considered dependent, and
the greater the value, the higher the dependence.

On the other hand, “conviction” is an evaluation indicator, which indicates whether or
not the rule does not make a wrong prediction, paying attention to the exclusion event
of the conclusion: Y of the obtained rule. If the conviction is large, it is less likely that
the conclusion: Y is not the case for the premise: X.
The apriori algorithm using ARM is based on the principle that “support of a certain
item set is always less than or equal to support of its partial item set” (Agrawal and
Srikant 1994). Therefore, unlike BCPNN, in ARM it is not necessary to calculate lift
and conviction of all combinations for signal detection.
In this study, we used visual mining studio version 8.2 (NTT DATA Mathematical
Systems Inc, Japan) for ARM.
The detection criterion (case; n111 ≥ 3, lift > 1, conviction > 1) similar to those used in
a previous study were used (Noguchi et al. 2018a).
As well, in order to detect the signals related to poor prognosis adverse events, it is
necessary to set premise: X = suspect drug with CKD patients and conclusion: Y =
poor prognosis dementia. In this paper, the calculation formula based on the number
(n) of reports was omitted.

4.3.2. Signal detection using Bayesian confidence propagation neuralnetwork
BCPNN is an artificial neural network inspired by Bayesian estimations. IC025 is the
lower end of 95% confidence interval for IC. The detection criterion of this statistical
model is IC025 > 0 similar to those used in a previous study were used (Bate et al. 1998).
A table for calculating IC025 which is an indicator of BCPNN considering the CKD
patient is shown in the Fig.

To calculate the IC025 of the CKD patient, replace it as follows: N11 = n111, N1+ = n11+,
N+1 = n111 + n011, N++ = n111 + n101+ n011+ n001.
In addition, the calculation method of general IC025 is shown in Eqs. (3) to (6) as follows:
In this study, the validity of drugs detected in ARM was examined using BCPNN.
