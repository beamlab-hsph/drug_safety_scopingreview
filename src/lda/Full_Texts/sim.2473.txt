SUMMARY
Post-marketing drug safety data sets are often massive, and entail problems with heterogeneity and
selection bias. Nevertheless, quantitative methods have proven a very useful aid to help clinical experts
in screening for previously unknown associations in these data sets. The WHO international drug safety
database is the world’s largest data set of its kind with over three million reports on suspected adverse
drug reaction incidents. Since 1998, an exploratory data analysis method has been in routine use to
screen for quantitative associations in this data set. This method was originally based on large sample
approximations and limited to pairwise associations, but in this article we propose more accurate credibility interval estimates and extend the method to allow for the analysis of more complex quantitative
associations. The accuracy of the proposed credibility intervals is evaluated through comparison to
precise Monte Carlo simulations. In addition, we propose a Mantel–Haenszel-type adjustment to control
for suspected confounders. Copyright ? 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

1. INTRODUCTION
Despite great eorts in investigating drug safety before new substances are introduced on the
market, some adverse drug reactions (ADR) are not detected until after drug launch. This
applies in particular to reactions that have low incidence, occur primarily in groups that tend
to be excluded from clinical trials (such as pregnant women or young children), are due

to drug interactions or have long times to onset [1]. Screening of spontaneous reports is
one of several tools for post-marketing drug safety surveillance [2, 3], and remains the main
method for generating hypotheses related to previously unknown ADRs [4, 5]. In this context,
international initiatives have the advantage of accumulating information from all over the
world, something which increases the potential for early detection of drug safety problems
[6]. At the same time, the massive data sets involved require quantitative methods for ecient
knowledge discovery.
The WHO Collaborating Centre for International Drug Monitoring in Uppsala, Sweden (also
known as the Uppsala Monitoring Centre or the UMC) holds the world’s largest database of
spontaneous reports on suspected ADR incidents. The rst reports in this data set date back
to 1967, and as of November 2004, 75 countries from around the world forward their ADR
reports to the UMC. The database currently consists of over three million reports, with more
than 14 000 distinct drug substances and almost 2000 distinct ADR terms. Out of the over 20
million possible combinations of one of these drug substances with one of these ADR terms,
around 600 000 pairs occur together on at least one report in this data set.
In recent years, several methods for quantitative analysis of spontaneous reporting data sets
have been proposed—some Bayesian [7, 8] and others non-Bayesian [9, 10]. Unlike earlier
approaches [11, 12], the lack of readily accessible and reliable international usage data has
led these methods to focus on associations within the data sets rather than on proper rates of
incidence. Instead of external data, the whole database of reported ADR incidents is thus
the reference against which each possible association is compared. Despite the biases in
this reference population and despite biases in reporting behaviour and problems with data
quality (e.g. the highly variable amount of information available on dierent reports and the
phenomenon of duplicate reports [13]), these quantitative methods have proven a useful aid
in highlighting drug–ADR combinations for clinical review [14, 15]. One advantage with the
study of associations within the data set is that some biases (such as the relative over-reporting
of new drug substances) is automatically compensated for [10].
Let dependency derivation denote the screening for quantitative associations between events
in a large data set. An obvious diculty with exploratory data analysis ventures is the multiple comparisons problem: given the large number of possible associations that are evaluated
simultaneously, it is hard to attribute a degree of signicance to the ndings. In addition,
for drug safety data sets, even if signicant quantitative associations between two events
can be identied, they could potentially be driven by confounding variables or reporting
biases. As a consequence, we use dependency derivation as a means not to draw nal conclusions about possible associations between events in the data set but to generate hypotheses.
Any suspicion raised through dependency derivation needs to be further evaluated and tested
in some follow-up procedure. In the routine screening of the WHO database for potential
drug safety problems, this follow-up procedure consists of clinical evaluation of the individual case reports for each highlighted association, by an international panel of drug safety
experts [6].
In screening the database, we are interested in both the estimated strengths of association
and the support in data; strong associations are more likely to be indicative of important
problems, but with very little support in data even strong quantitative associations are likely
to be spurious. The problem with the straightforward use of a test for association is that
it may tend to highlight weak associations with large data support [8]. On the other hand,
raw strength of association estimates are sensitive to random variation and thus vulnerable to

spurious associations. In fact, for these large and sparse data sets, even the use of classical
condence intervals around traditional measures of association are insucient to compensate
for a limited data support. As an illustration, consider a drug substance for which in the
rst quarter after marketing there were only two case reports among the three million in the
WHO database. Even for a common ADR term, with say 100 000 reports in total, its presence
on one of the two reports, will yield an observed count of 1 for the combination which by
far exceeds the expected count (0.07) under the assumption of independence. Moreover, the
95 per cent condence interval for the corresponding log-odds ratio ([0:60 6:14]) excludes 0
and thus indicates a quantitative association. Consequently, if log-odds ratios with condence
intervals were used as the screening criterion, single reports on a particular ADR would suce
to highlight new drugs for clinical review.
Bayesian dependency derivation methods can be used to provide a reasonable balance
between strength of association and support in data [7, 8]. Bayesian inference is sometimes
criticised on account of the explicit incorporation of prior assumptions in the analysis, but in
dependency derivation this is the greatest advantage over classical inference: the conservative
prior distribution (based on the a priori assumption of mutual independence between any two
events) moderates the strength of association estimates towards the baseline assumption of no
association (especially at low counts) and thereby reduces the risk of highlighting spurious
associations.
Since 1998, a Bayesian dependency derivation method has been in routine use to rank quantitative associations between drug substances and ADR terms in the WHO database [7, 16].
The use of this method to highlight drug–ADR combinations for clinical review has been
thoroughly tested [14] and integrated into the overall signal detection strategy at the UMC
[15, 17–19]. Several associations rst highlighted with this approach have been published in
the medical literature [20, 21]. The algorithmic framework used is referred to as the Bayesian
Condence Propagation Neural Network (BCPNN). The BCPNN is a statistical neural network
where the nodes correspond to dierent events and the weights between nodes are proportional to the strength of association between dierent events. The BCPNN can be used for
complex tasks such as classication and unsupervised pattern recognition [22–26], but for the
purpose of dependency derivation, only the weights between nodes in the network (referred to
as information components or IC values) are of interest. These can be estimated directly from
data, so for transparency we shall refer to the use of the BCPNN for Bayesian dependency
derivation as IC analysis throughout this article.
In this article, we propose more accurate estimates for the credibility intervals of the IC
distribution that do not rely on large sample theory. We show that the estimator previously
used for the IC posterior mean (p.m.e.) in fact better estimates the mode and argue in favour
of using this as the central IC estimate. In addition, we propose a generalization of the IC
to higher order associations in order to screen for ADR risk factors. We also introduce a
Mantel–Haenszel type of adjustment for the IC in order to control for potential confounders
in heterogeneous data sets.

2. IC ANALYSIS FOR PAIRWISE DEPENDENCY DERIVATION
Denote by ICxy the information component between events x and y for variables X and Y ,
respectively. The IC is dened as the base 2 logarithm of an observed-to-expected ratio for

the joint probability of the two events, where the expected value is calculated under the
assumption of mutual independence [7, 16]:
ICxy = log2

P(x; y)
P(x)P(y)

(1)

A positive IC value indicates that the two events co-occur more frequently than expected under
the assumption of independence, and a negative IC value indicates that they co-occur more
rarely. The IC is a function of the unknown probabilities P(x; y), P(x) and P(y), and Bayesian
inference is used to estimate the IC value. For convenience, a Dirichlet prior distribution (that
is conjugate to the multinomial distribution of data) is used for the probability parameters,
since this makes closed-form expressions for the posterior distributions of P(x; y), P(x) and
P(y) readily available. No such closed-form expression is known for the posterior distribution
of the IC itself, but in recent work, the use of Monte Carlo simulation based on the closedform expressions for P(x; y), P(x) and P(y), has been eective in learning more about the
shape of the posterior IC distribution [27]. We use this approach to evaluate the accuracy of
the approximations proposed in this article.
To simplify the annotation: with respect to the presence or absence of two events x and y,
denote by p11 , p1· and p·1 the probability parameters for P(x; y), P(x) and P(y), respectively.
Similarly, denote by n11 , n1· and n·1 the corresponding numbers of observations in the data
set. In addition, denote by n10 the number of cases where X = x but Y = y, by n01 the number
of cases where X = x but Y = y, and by n00 the number of cases where both X = x and Y = y.
Denote by p10 , p01 and p00 the corresponding probabilities.
In our data model, the observed counts n11 , n10 , n01 and n00 are assumed to follow a
Mn(p11 ; p10 ; p01 ; p00 ; n·· ) distribution. With a Di(11 ; 10 ; 01 ; 00 ) prior distribution for p11 ; p10 ;
p01 and p00 , it is a standard result from Bayesian statistics that the corresponding posterior
distribution is Di(11 ; 10 ; 01 ; 00 ), where ij = ij +nij (in an abstract sense, the hyperparameters
ij can be thought of as assumed prior observations) [28].
In this model, the marginal distributions of p11 ; p10 ; p01 and p00 are beta. The same is true
for p1· = p11 + p10 and p·1 = p11 + p01 . Specically:
p11 ∼ Be(11 ; 10 + 01 + 00 )
p1· ∼ Be(11 + 10 ; 01 + 00 )

(2)

p·1 ∼ Be(11 + 01 ; 10 + 00 )
However, since p11 , p1· and p·1 are not independent (p1· = p11 + p10 and p·1 = p11 + p01 ),
it will sometimes be a coarse approximation to consider the marginal distributions separately
as has been done earlier [7, 16], and we will in this article base our analyses on the full
Dirichlet distribution.
Some general problems with observed-to-expected ratios should be kept in mind. Observedto-expected ratios are relevant measures of association primarily for events with low expected frequencies where there is virtually no upper limit to the observed-to-expected ratios.
In contrast, if the overall frequency of a certain ADR term is as high as, for example, 0.5, the
observed-to-expected ratio for its association with a given drug substance can never exceed

2—even if that ADR term occurs on every report for that drug substance. As a consequence,
comparisons between IC values can potentially be misleading if the expected frequencies vary
signicantly in magnitude. Another problem with observed-to-expected ratios is that there
may be a spill-over eect from a large observed number of reports for an event pair to the
expected number of reports for that event pair. Specically, if the drug substance under study
is very common and there are unexpectedly many reports on this drug substance with a particular ADR, this may inuence the overall prevalence of that ADR term so much that the
strength of association is underestimated by the observed-to-expected ratio. These two problems rarely aect pairwise IC analysis between drug substances and ADR terms in standard
drug safety data sets much, but may be important in the analysis of other types of events or
of smaller data sets. To minimize the risk for misleading results, it may in some situations
be sensible to accompany the estimated IC values for highlighted associations with standard
log-odds ratios.

2.1. The moderating prior distribution
The aim of IC analysis is to generate useful leads with respect to quantitative associations
in a data set. As previously discussed, it is in this context crucial to avoid the highlighting
of an abundance of associations with weak support in data, but at the same time focus on
estimated strength of association. With respect to this issue, Bayesian dependency derivation
based on a conservative prior distribution has proven instrumental in moderating the estimated
strengths of association when data is scarce [7, 8]. The Bayesian moderation in combination
with the use of credibility intervals provides an ecient, pragmatic compromise between
methods based on statistical signicance only (that may be sensitive to weak associations
with large data support) and methods based on raw observed-to-expected ratios (that tend to
highlight associations with very little data support). Since the impact of the prior distribution
diminishes as data accumulates, for combinations with large support there is little dierence
between Bayesian and classical estimates.
To ascertain moderation of the posterior distribution towards the baseline assumption of
independence (IC = 0) for all possible associations in all possible data sets, assume a
Di(11 ; 10 ; 01 ; 00 ) prior distribution for p11 , p10 , p01 and p00 where:
11 = q1· q·1 · ··
10 = q1· q·0 · ··
01 = q0· q·1 · ··

This prior distribution incorporates the independence assumption by setting the hyperparameters proportional to the products of the corresponding marginal relative frequencies
(in fact to posterior mean estimates for the marginal probabilities based on Be(1=2; 1=2) hyperpriors). The benet of this is that the posterior IC distribution always is centred between
0 and the raw observed-to-expected log-ratio, and that it can be evaluated even when one of
the marginal frequencies is zero, which is important for computational stability.
In the abstract sense mentioned above, the moderating prior distribution is equivalent to an
assumed extra batch of data where the two events under study are independent, co-occur 0.5
times and where the marginal relative frequencies for the two events are approximately the
same as in the real data set. With this approach, the prior sample size ·· may vary, but 11
always equals 0.5 and since it is primarily 11 that determines the shape of the IC distribution
[27], the shape of the prior distribution will be approximately the same for all associations
under study.
This prior distribution is based on the same principles as the prior previously used in IC
analysis (see References [7, 16]). The major dierences are that the new prior is based on the
joint Dirichlet distribution for the model parameters (instead of independent beta distributions)
and that the prior sample size has been halved. The reduction in prior sample size yields a
more diuse prior distribution that better reects our initial uncertainty about the IC values in
the WHO database. For data sets with dierent characteristics (size, sparsity, heterogeneity)
than the WHO database, the factor 0.5 in the expression for ·· should be adjusted. It may,
for example, be sensible to reduce this factor (and thus the moderating eect of the prior
distribution) for smaller data sets.
2.2. Central IC estimates
Arbitrarily accurate estimates for the posterior mean of the IC distribution are available [29].
However, as the IC distribution is generally unimodal, maximum a posteriori (m.a.p.) estimates may be used for central estimates instead. The main advantage of the m.a.p. estimate
is that it is well suited for use in stratied IC analysis (see Section 2.4) and that it has the
intuitive property of being equal to 0 when the estimated joint probability equals the product
of the estimated marginal probabilities. In addition, the concept of a most likely value for an
unknown parameter is perhaps more natural than that of an expected value, and this is an
important aspect in the drug safety application, where the results must be interpretable for
non-statisticians.

The same expression has been used earlier as a crude estimate for the IC mean [7, 16]. To
study the accuracy of this expression as an estimate for on the one hand the mean and on
the other hand the mode of the IC distribution, estimated values were compared to Monte
Carlo simulated values based on 50 000 draws from each posterior IC distribution (the mode
of the simulated IC distributions was estimated based on the empirical relationship mode ≈
3 · median − 2 · mean for unimodal curves of moderate asymmetry [30]). A random subset
of 1000 drug–ADR combinations that occur in the WHO database were used for evaluation.
Throughout, the moderating prior distribution described in Section 2.1 was used. The results
are displayed in Figure 1. Clearly, (6) is a better estimate of the mode than of the mean, in
particular for low counts. Table I displays the average errors in the two estimates for dierent
joint counts n11 .

two-sided 95 per cent credibility interval for the IC, by which associations are typically ranked

in IC analysis [7, 16]. The use of a lower credibility interval limit accounts for uncertainty
in a conservative manner. The idea is to choose an estimate so that the true value is greater
than the estimate with a given degree of certainty (here 97.5 per cent). Together with the
moderating prior distribution (see Section 2.1) this helps to reduce the number of false leads
generated by IC analysis.
The IC credibility interval estimates were previously based on a normal approximation for
the IC distribution [7, 16]. Monte Carlo experiments indicate that while the IC distribution
tends to a normal distribution asymptotically (for large n11 ), the assumption leads to a rather
crude approximation for rare pairs of events (n11 6 10). Since more than 80 per cent of the
observed drug–ADR pairs in the WHO database fall into this critical category, the need for
improvement is clear [27]. The use of brute force Monte Carlo simulation to estimate the
posterior percentiles would give arbitrarily accurate estimates, but at too high a cost in computational complexity. Instead, we propose an approach based on an approximate formula for
the dierence between the mode and the lower credibility interval limit for the IC distribution.
Let 025 denote the true dierence between ICm:a:p: and IC025 . Given estimates for ICm:a:p:
and 025 , IC025 can be estimated as follows:
025 = IC
m:a:p: − 
ˆ 025
IC

(7)

Empirical testing suggests that functions of the following general form model 025 well
(Ar and Br are tted parameters):
−1=2
−3=2
025 (11 ) = Ar · 11
+ Br · 11

(8)

In particular:
lim 025 (11 ) = 0

11 →∞

(9)

and because there are only two tted parameters, there is little risk for over-tting.
By using dierent parameters Ar and Br for dierent ratios r = 11 = min(1· ; ·1 ), the impact
of the smaller of the two marginal parameters may be accounted for. We have estimated
constants Ar and Br for 11 dierent values of r (0:0; 0:1; : : : ; 1:0), and use linear interpolation
in between. Thus, for a given ratio r, the value of 025 is estimated by the weighted average
of the 025 values for the two closest values of r for which there are tted constants Ar and
Br available. For details about tting the parameters in (8) and their values for dierent r,
see Section A.1.
To evaluate the accuracy of the proposed approach to estimate IC025 , we compared Monte
Carlo simulated values based on 50 000 draws to the estimated values, for the same data
set as in Section 2.2. For comparison, the accuracy of the normal approximation [7, 16] was
also evaluated. The results are displayed in Figure 2. Clearly, the proposed approximation is
more accurate, in particular for low counts. Table II displays the average errors in the two
estimates for dierent joint counts n11 .
2.4. Stratied IC analysis
Although the purpose of dependency derivation is hypothesis generation, and a certain number
of false leads is acceptable in this context, it is important to keep the proportion of false leads
at a minimum. One approach to improving the specicity is to detect and control for potential

confounders. As for other epidemiological applications, adjusted overall estimates may be
quoted when there is no suspicion of eect modication, otherwise stratum-specic estimates
should be used [31]. There are at least two dierent ways to adjust the IC for potential
confounders.
The most obvious adjusted IC estimate is a weighted average of the stratum-specic IC
values as previously suggested [32]. However, this approach requires a careful selection of
stratication variables, because it is particularly sensitive to data thinning. Strata with few
or no observations of the event combination of interest will yield unreliable stratum-specic
IC estimates, and since the weights in calculating this adjusted estimate are not necessarily
correlated to the reliability of the estimates, this may lead to an unreliable adjusted IC estimate.
Indeed, tentative experiments based on Monte Carlo simulation indicate that this approach to
adjusting the IC typically leads to wider credibility intervals than for the unadjusted IC, which,
in addition to the loss in precision, is a technical disadvantage since it makes more dicult
the derivation of accurate credibility intervals.
An alternative approach to calculating adjusted IC estimates is to use a Mantel–Haenszel
type of adjustment where the denominator in the ICm:a:p: formula is equal to the weighted
average of the expected joint probabilities in the dierent strata:

The numbers listed in the rightmost column are ICm:a:p: estimates with the moderating prior (IC025 estimates in brackets).

Since the numerator is not aected by the adjustment, the spread of the adjusted IC can
be expected to be similar to that for the unadjusted IC, and empirical testing supports this
assumption. Consequently, the approximate credibility intervals proposed in Section 2.3 may
be used for the adjusted IC025 as well. Moderation towards zero can be achieved in a similar
way as for unadjusted estimates,
by spreading the prior sample size over the dierent strata and

replacing q1· q·1 in (4) by nk=1 q1·|z q·1|z q··z —the expected joint probability for the two events
under the adjustment. Here q··z is the relative frequency of stratum z in the database, q1·|z
and q·1|z are p.m.e. estimates based on Be(q··z =2; q··z =2) priors, for the marginal probabilities
in each stratum.
As an illustration of the general usefulness of stratied IC analysis, we have investigated the
association in the WHO database between the terms sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS)
and Polio virus vaccine live oral. The unadjusted ICm:a:p: estimate for this association is
4.78 and the corresponding IC025 estimate is 4.62. However, since the Polio virus vaccine is
typically given to small children and only small children suer from SIDS, this is likely to
be confounded by age [8].
There are seven predened age groups in the WHO database: unspecied, 0–1 month, 2
months–4 years, 5–11 years, 12–16 years, 17–69 years and 70+ years. Table III displays
stratum-specic IC values for the association between SIDS and the Polio virus vaccine for
these age groups. Based on this stratication, the adjusted ICm:a:p: estimate according to (10),
is 1.21 and the corresponding IC025 estimate is 1.05. Clearly, the stratication by age reduces the apparent measure of association. At the same time, the relatively strong association
between SIDS and the Polio virus vaccine in the age: unspecied stratum renders dubious the
listing of any overall IC estimate (adjusted or not). In this situation, a list of stratum-specic
IC values is probably a more appropriate output. Please note that a proper examination of this
quantitative association would require the consideration of other potential confounders as well.
Some problems with routine stratication by a limited set of predened variables have been
pointed out previously [33]. For the WHO database, we use association-specic stratication
in the post-processing of clinically interesting drug–ADR pairs.
2.5. Example: a scan for drug–ADR associations in the WHO database
To study in practice the impact of the proposed changes to IC analysis (new prior distribution
and improved credibility interval estimates). We have carried out a complete scan of the WHO
database (as of quarter 3, 2003) with both methods.

Figure 3. The evolution over time of the IC between captopril and coughing, with the old
and the new approach. Central estimates together with 95 per cent credibility intervals are
marked in the plot: (a) old approach; and (b) new approach.

Table IV displays a cross-classication of all observed drug–ADR pairs in the WHO
database with respect to whether the IC025 values are positive or negative (this is the threshold
used in routine screening of the WHO ADR database) with the old and the new approach,
respectively. Clearly, the agreement between the two approaches is quite good: with respect to
this threshold, the two methods dier for only around 4000 out of the over 600 000 observed
drug–ADR pairs and Cohen’s kappa measure is 0.97 (a Cohen’s kappa of 1 would indicate
perfect agreement). Where the two methods dier, the new approach seems to be somewhat
more conservative, but there are event pairs for which the new but not the old IC025 estimate
exceeds 0. These tend to have low joint counts n11 (ranging from 3 to 12) and low marginal
counts n1· for the drug (ranging from 3 to 68 in all but three cases, for which the values are
signicantly higher). In particular, the new approach alone highlights 84 event pairs where
there is three reports in total for the drug—all on the same reaction. Because these event pairs
may correspond to important problems for recently marketed drugs, it is a strength from a
monitoring perspective that the new approach highlights them.
2.6. Example: a captopril–coughing time scan
To further examine the practical impact of the proposed changes to IC analysis, we studied
the evolution in time of the IC between the drug substance captopril and the ADR term
coughing with the two approaches. The association between captopril and coughing has been
well known since 1986, but earlier work has shown that if IC analysis had been in use at the

3751

time a quantitative association between captopril and coughing would have been highlighted
already in 1981 [7]. We were interested to see whether the proposed changes to IC analysis
would delay or expedite the highlighting of this quantitative association in the database.
Figure 3 displays the change over time for the IC central estimates (together with
95 per cent credibility interval estimates) for the captopril–coughing quantitative association,
based on the old and new IC analysis approaches. The credibility interval estimates dier
when the joint count is low, but the association would be highlighted in the same quarter
regardless of which approach was used.

3. IC ANALYSIS FOR HIGHER ORDER DEPENDENCY DERIVATION
The IC as dened in Section 2 is a measure of association for pairs of events only, but
there is often an interest in higher order associations. In the drug safety application, this
may include drug–drug interactions or three-way associations involving a drug substance, an
ADR term and another risk factor (e.g. age or gender). Generally, a higher order measure
of association should capture disproportionality in the occurrence of groups of events in the
data set, which is not explicable by lower order associations. For three-way associations, we
would be interested in sets of three events that occur unexpectedly often even when pairwise
associations between the events are accounted for.
The usefulness of extending the IC value to higher order associations is not necessarily
limited to the dependency derivation application. Higher order IC values could be introduced
in both the feedforward and the recurrent BCPNN in order to improve performance in classication and unsupervised pattern recognition, respectively.
An extension of the IC to third-order associations was previously proposed in Reference
[16], but this did not compensate for pairwise associations. We propose the following denition
of a third-order IC, which does:
ICxyz = ICxy|z − ICxy

(11)

where
ICxy|z = log2

P(x; y | z)
P(x | z)P(y | z)

(12)

The logic behind this denition of the third-order IC is that if there is a positive third-order
association, the presence of the third event should make the pairwise association between
the other two events stronger (i.e. ICxy|z should exceed ICxy , etc). Conversely, if there is
a negative third-order association, the presence of the third event should make the pairwise
association between the other two events weaker.
It is easy to show that this denition is symmetric in x; y and z:
ICxyz = ICxy|z − ICxy
= ICxz|y − ICxz
= ICyz|x − ICyz

(13)

 ET AL.

3752

since with simple algebraic operations, we can re-express ICxyz as
ICxyz = log2
= log2

P(y; z | x)
P(y)P(z)
− log2
P(y | x)P(z | x)
P(y; z)
P(x; y; z)P(x)P(y)P(z)
P(x; y)P(x; z)P(y; z)

(14)

The third-order IC can be seen as an observed-to-expected ratio, where the expected value
accounts for both main eects and pairwise interactions. To see this, let
Wx1 ::: xn = 2ICx1 ::: xn

(15)

Then the third-order ICxyz may be re-expressed as
ICxyz = log2

P(x; y; z)
P(x)P(y)P(z)Wxy Wxz Wyz

(16)

which is an approximate observed-to-expected ratio accounting for pairwise associations as
well as main eects.
The generalization of the IC to even higher orders is straightforward. For example, the
fourth-order IC can be dened as follows:
ICxyzv = ICxyz|v − ICxyz = ICxyv|z − ICxyv
= ICxvz|y − ICxvz = ICyzv|x − ICyzv

(17)

which with algebraic manipulations can be re-expressed as
ICxyzv = log2

P(x; y; z; v)
P(x)P(y)P(z)Wxy Wxz Wxv Wyz Wyv Wzv Wxyz Wxyv Wxzv Wyzv

(18)

As desired, the approximate expected joint probability in the denominator accounts for both
second- and third-order associations in addition to the main eects.
Most of the theory developed in Section 2 for pairwise IC values holds approximately for
higher order IC values. A third-order IC m.a.p. estimate similar to that for pairwise IC is
ICm:a:p: ≈ log2

E[p111 ]E[p1·· ]E[p·1· ]E[p··1 ]
E[p11· ]E[p1·1 ]E[p·11 ]

(19)

Credibility intervals for third-order IC values may be calculated based on (7) and (8) if,
in the denition of r, min(1· ; ·1 ) is replaced by min(1·· ; ·1· ; ··1 ). Adjustment of higher
order IC values to control for confounders is also possible. For third-order IC values, the
Mantel–Haenszel adjusted m.a.p. estimate is
E[p111 ]
(E[p

ICm:a:p: ≈ log2 n

(20)

Furthermore, it is straightforward to generalize the moderating prior distribution described in
Section 2.1 to higher order IC values (see Section A.2).

3.1. Example: a risk factors scan
Higher order IC analysis may be used to search for factors that inuence the risk of a certain
ADR given a particular drug. If, for example, the third-order IC between a certain drug
substance x, a certain ADR term y and a certain age group z were positive, this may indicate
that patients of age group z are more prone to experiencing x-induced y than the population in
general. Routine scans for third-order IC values between a drug substance, an ADR term and
some other factor (e.g. a certain gender or an age groups) may therefore be used to generate
hypotheses with respect to potential high risk groups of patients. Positive higher order IC
values may also be indicative of confounding, but for confounders, further investigation will
show no signicant variation in the IC values over the dierent strata.
Terfenadine was withdrawn due to concerns about its cardiotoxicity. Additionally, terfenadine and ketoconazole are known to interact so that the risk of heart problems is higher
when the two are co-administered. Indeed, there are ve reports on terfenadine, ketoconazole
and ventricular brillation in the WHO database and the corresponding third-order IC value
is 2.40 with a lower credibility interval limit of 1.08. If we were to examine all three-way
associations between terfenadine and ventricular brillation and other events related to age,
country, gender or other medication, there are 27 other events that occur at least once together
with terfenadine and ventricular brillation on reports in the data set. Out of these, only two
events other than the co-administration of ketoconazole have positive third-order IC025 values
with terfenadine and ventricular brillation (see Table V for the top ve associations with
respect to IC025 values). Based on this analysis, ketoconazole is clearly the most inuential
risk factor for this association.

4. DISCUSSION
The analysis of spontaneous reporting data remains the cornerstone of post-marketing drug
safety surveillance. Despite problems with data heterogeneity, it is the most important source
of information for discovering previously unknown adverse eects from drugs after they are
introduced on the market. IC analysis has proven to be an ecient method for exploratory
quantitative analysis of post-marketing drug safety data [14] that while meeting the computational requirements also provides sophisticated protection against spurious associations.
However, IC analysis as originally implemented [7, 16] is based on large sample approximations, and despite the large total number of reports in the WHO drug safety database the
number of reports on a given drug–ADR pair is typically small (due to the large number
of drug substances and ADR terms involved). Thus there is a clear need for the improved

credibility intervals proposed in this article, and the results presented in Section 2.3 indicate
that they do lead to improved accuracy and may allow for earlier discovery of problems
related to recently marketed drug substances. These results are based on randomly selected
drug–ADR pairs from the WHO database, but we expect the conclusions to hold generally
for rare events in large and sparse data sets.
The Mantel–Haenszel adjustment for the IC proposed in Section 2.4 is important in that
it will allow for robust exploratory data analysis in the presence of confounding. However,
more research is needed to specify ecient strategies for how and when to carry out stratied
analyses of spontaneous reporting data. It is, at present time, unclear whether routine adjustment by set of pre-dened variables for all event pairs in the database is to be preferred over
unadjusted estimates in the initial screening of the database [33]. If higher order IC analysis
or other sophisticated pattern recognition methods could be used for automated confounder
detection, this may allow for data-driven association-specic adjustment by suspected confounders, and we aim to investigate this further in the future. The strong association between
SIDS and the Polio vaccine in the age unspecied stratum of the WHO ADR database (see
Section 2.4) is likely to be due to residual confounding and emphasizes the problem of missing data for the stratication variables. This issue too needs to be resolved before optimal use
of stratied dependency derivation is possible.
While the quantitative improvements for pairwise IC analysis proposed in Section 2 are
renements of the existing methodology, the generalization to higher order associations in
Section 3 allows for altogether new types of analysis related to complex quantitative associations. In combination with our methods for unsupervised pattern recognition [25], the methods
presented in this article provide a comprehensive range of techniques for ecient knowledge
discovery in spontaneous reporting data. An alternative approach to studying higher order
associations would be to t a generalized linear model with interaction terms, and in a similar
spirit, other groups have proposed observed-to-expected ratios where the expected frequency
is calculated based on a tted log-linear model [34]. The advantage of higher order IC analysis in this context is that it is more direct (it does not require iterative methods for tting)
and allows for local analysis (in the sense that the higher order IC value for a certain set
of events is only inuenced by the joint and marginal counts for that specic set of events).
Drug–drug interaction detection is a type of higher order association which is particularly important in the quantitative analysis of spontaneous reporting data and several approaches have
been proposed [34–36]. In theory there is no obvious reason why higher order IC analysis
could not be used to screen for drug interactions as well as any other risk factors, but there
has recently been a tendency to focus on more simple methods for the detection of drug–drug
interactions [37], which indicates that more research into the basic characteristics of drug–drug
interactions spontaneous reporting may be needed to resolve this issue successfully.

5. CONCLUSIONS
Earlier, IC analysis has proven useful in hypothesis generation with respect to quantitative
associations in large drug safety data sets. In this article, we have proposed improved methods
for posterior inference in IC analysis, including an accurate estimate for the mode and significantly improved credibility interval estimates. In addition, we have extended the IC measure
of association to higher order associations and illustrated the usefulness of this on real world

and applied to real world data.
