Abstract
Purpose Pregabalin is a gamma-aminobutyric acid
(GABA) analogue approved for the treatment of epilepsy,
neuropathic pain and generalised anxiety disorder. As a
GABA analogue, there has been some concern about an
abuse liability. We aimed to investigate the possible abuse
liability of pregabalin.
Methods By applying a Bayesian data-mining algorithm to
reports of possible drug abuse or addiction in the Swedish
national register of adverse drug reactions (SWEDIS), we
calculated the information component (IC) for pregabalin
and reports of abuse and addiction.
Results Out of 198 reports indicative of abuse or addiction
to any drug, 16 concerned pregabalin. The IC became
significantly elevated in the fourth quarter of 2008, rising to
3.99 (95% confidence interval 3.21–4.59) at the end of
2009.
Conclusion Based on the signal from the present study, we
conclude that pregabalin is likely to be associated with an
abuse potential.

Introduction
Pregabalin is a gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) analogue used for the treatment of epilepsy, neuropathic pain
and generalised anxiety disorder (GAD) [1]. Although its
precise mechanism of action is unclear, pregabalin
decreases central neuronal excitability by binding to an
auxiliary subunit (α2-δ protein) of a voltage-gated calcium
channel on neurons in the central nervous system and
reduces the release of several neurotransmitters, including
glutamate, noradrenaline and substance P.
In the European Union as well as in the US,
pregabalin was first approved for the treatment of
epilepsy and peripheral neuropathic pain [1]. As a GABA
analogue, there was some concern about the potential for
addiction and drug abuse [1]. Premarketing trials had
produced somewhat conflicting results in this respect.
Studies in vitro did not show that the drug or its
metabolites interacted with GABAA or GABAB receptors
or inhibited GABA uptake or degradation, and studies in
rats and monkeys found no propensity towards an abuse
liability, although modest withdrawal signs upon discontinuation were observed in rats [1]. In addition, a dedicated
clinical study in 15 recreational alcohol/sedative users found
that pregabalin in therapeutic doses of 200–450 mg did not
produce the same responses as diazepam, indicating that the
drug did not have the profile of a prototypic drug of abuse,
although it did produce subjective effects on a wide variety of
measures that were different from placebo [1]. Consequently,
the potential for drug abuse or physical dependence for
pregabalin was assessed to be low at the time of marketing
authorisation [1]. It was noted, however, that euphoria
occurred as an adverse event in clinical trials among 1–10%
of patients depending on dose, compared with 0.5% for
placebo [1]. Other adverse events such as depersonalisation,

948

nervousness, abnormal thinking and amnesia, symptoms that
may reflect benzodiazepine-like adverse events, were also
observed [1].
In later clinical trials in patients with central neuropathic
pain and in patients with GAD, euphoria as an adverse
event was also reported to be common for pregabalin [1],
and assessments of withdrawal symptoms in clinical trials
of GAD showed a profile similar to that of lorazepam [1],
especially in the 600-mg/day dosage. There was, however,
no indication of significant dose escalation in open-label
trials [1].
An essential feature of effective risk management for
drugs with an uncertain abuse liability is post-marketing
surveillance that can detect the emergence of an abuse
problem before the abuse of the medication becomes a
major public health problem. Addiction is not labelled in
the European Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC)
for pregabalin, but is included as a rare adverse drug
reaction (ADR) on the US label [2, 3]. As the question of
the possible abuse potential of pregabalin is currently
unsolved, we conducted a database analysis of reports of
possible drug abuse or addiction to pregabalin in the
Swedish national register of adverse drug reactions
(SWEDIS) [4].

Materials and methods
At the end of 2009, SWEDIS contained some 100,000
spontaneous reports submitted since 1965 by Swedish
physicians to the Swedish Medical Products Agency
(MPA). A Swedish dictionary is used for coding ADRs,
built on a three-level hierarchical structure developed by the
MPA [4]. The first level is the system organ class, followed
by group terms, and finally preferred terms. The dictionary
holds a little over 1,000 preferred terms.
The information in a report consists of patient demographics,
reported ADRs, medication and a case narrative, often

a
As each report may contain more
than one adverse event term, the

indicative of abuse may be less

events

accompanied by copies of medical charts. All reports are
reviewed by the MPA and a causality assessment is made, i.e.
medicines can be listed as being suspected of having caused the
reaction or as concomitant medication not related to the ADR.
Drugs are coded with the WHO Collaborating Centre for
Drug Statistics Methodology International Anatomical
Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classification [5]. To assess
whether cases of possible drug abuse or addiction to
pregabalin have been more commonly reported than
expected, we calculated the information component (IC)
[6] for the preferred terms “addiction”, “drug addiction”,
“dependence”, “tolerance increased” and “drug abuse” as
a group. As some reports indicative of abuse may
sometimes be coded with the terms “intoxication”,
“overdose”, or “pathological inebriation”, we also manually scanned all such reports for every drug in SWEDIS
(n=718, of which 9 included pregabalin as a suspected
drug) and included such reports in the calculations. In this
respect, we only included reports in which the reporting
physician had clearly stated that the patient had abused the
suspected drug.
The IC is a logarithmic measure of association derived
from a Bayesian data-mining algorithm used commonly in
pharmacovigilance practice for the detection of potential
safety signals [6]. An IC of 0 results from drug–event
combinations for which the number of observed cases is the
same as that which might be expected from the overall
reporting in the dataset. Positive values represent combinations reported more frequently and negative values more
infrequently than expected. Confidence intervals (CIs) of
the IC (IC ±2 standard deviations) are calculated to account
for sampling variability. We have previously shown that
this methodology can be applied to SWEDIS with a near
80% probability for signalled drug–event combinations to
be correctly labelled [4]. As reports before 1980 often
contained only limited information, we restricted the
analysis to reports entered into the database from 1980
until the end of 2009. As a significant proportion (15%) of

the reports concerned ADRs from vaccines (ATC class J07)
and since such medicinal products are not associated with
an abuse potential, we excluded these from the dataset. All
statistical calculations were performed in Microsoft Excel
2007 (Microsoft Corporation).

Results
Out of 82,714 reports in SWEDIS during the study
period, a total of 198 reports indicative of abuse or
addiction to any drug were identified, of which 16
concerned pregabalin (Tables 1, 2). Three of the reports
for pregabalin were received from the same reporter, and
the other 13 from single reporters across Sweden. The
evolution of the IC with the 95% CI over time for
pregabalin is shown in Fig. 1. The first reports were
received in the first quarter of 2008, and the IC first
became significantly elevated in the fourth quarter of 2008
with four reports entered into SWEDIS (IC=2.38 [95% CI
0.70, 3.50]), rising to 3.99 [3.21–4.59] at the end of 2009
on the basis of 16 reports. An overview of relevant data
from these reports can be found in Table 3. The median
age of the patients was 29 years (range 18–51, age
unknown for one case) and included 9 men and 7
women. The reported maximum daily doses ranged from
300 to 4,200 mg (median 1,000 mg), mostly taken as
single doses. Six reports were coded as “drug abuse” and
included one patient who injected pregabalin after
dissolving the substance in water, and one patient who
nasally inhaled the drug after crushing the contents of the
capsules. Feelings of becoming “high” or of “a nice
benzodiazepine effect” were described. Four reports were
coded as “intoxication”, in which patients reported
having taken pregabalin to “get high” or described an
effect similar to that of an “amphetamine trip” with
euphoria. Two reports were coded as “dependence” and
described feelings of being “high” and hospitalisations
for detoxification. Two reports were coded as “tolerance
increased” where patients increased their doses above the
maximum recommended (1,200 and 3,000 mg/day)
because of the waning of effect. One report was coded
as “drug addiction” in which the patient described a
feeling of becoming “high” with a sensation of flying.
The last case was coded as “pathological inebriation” in
which the patient reported using pregabalin to potentiate
the effect of alcohol. Out of the 16 cases, 13 included a
history of past or current substance abuse, and 2 patients
reported selling part of their prescribed medication on the
black market. The indication for which pregabalin had
been prescribed was mostly unknown, but was reported
as non-specified anxiety in 5 cases, and non-specified
pain and GAD in 1 case.

Eur J Clin Pharmacol (2010) 66:947–953

Discussion
This is the first post-marketing study to show a signal of an
abuse liability for pregabalin. As is common for a drug with
an abuse liability, risk factors include a history of substance
abuse, which was present in 13 out of 16 of the reports in
SWEDIS. With a structure and pharmacodynamic profile
similar to that of pregabalin, gabapentin would also be
expected to exhibit a similar signal. However, we have
found no case indicative of abuse or addiction to
gabapentin in SWEDIS (data not shown). This difference
may be due to pharmacodynamic differences, differences
in reporting propensity or differences in the indications
for use. Pregabalin is approved for the treatment of
GAD, whereas gabapentin is not [7], and while the
indication for use was mostly unknown for the 16 cases
described herein, it is of note that anxiety was the reported
indication among the 6 cases where such information was
provided, suggesting an association between abuse liability
and indication, as has been described previously [8].
Some limitations with signals derived from data-mining
studies should be discussed. Data-mining methods in
pharmacovigilance practices provide signals and not evidence of safety problems [6]. Thus, the present finding of a
possible abuse liability for pregabalin should be considered
as a signal that needs further testing in other materials. A
potential source of bias is media attention concerning the
drug–event combination in question, i.e. media attention
may stimulate reporting, resulting in exaggerated signals.
However, there has been no such attention regarding
pregabalin and abuse in Sweden during the period of the
present study, nor any communications from regulatory
authorities regarding such a potential. Another conceivable
source of bias is when a drug is often co-prescribed with
another drug, which in turn is strongly associated with a
particular ADR. In this situation, the drug under study may be
suspected to cause the ADR, when in fact it is an innocent
bystander. In the present study, however, pregabalin was the
only suspected drug in 13 out of 16 cases, thereby rendering
this possibility unlikely. Under-reporting of ADRs indicative
of abuse might also introduce bias if this is selective for some
drugs, e.g. for older drugs compared with newer. It is not
possible to fully exclude such a possibility, but it would seem
unlikely that this type of bias would result in a steadily
increasing signal as presented in this report.

Conclusion
In Sweden, use of pregabalin is rapidly increasing and was
9.3 million defined daily doses (DDDs) in 2009, compared
with 4.6 million in 2007. Based on the signal from the
present study, we conclude that pregabalin is likely to be

Eur J Clin Pharmacol (2010) 66:947–953

associated with an abuse liability and that further studies
are urgently needed to characterise its extent and nature.
