Target-­Adverse Event Profiles to Augment
Pharmacovigilance: A Pilot Study With Six New Molecular
Entities
Peter Schotland1,*, Rebecca Racz1, David Jackson2, Robert Levin3, David G. Strauss1 and Keith Burkhart1

Clinical trials can fail to detect rare adverse events (AEs). We assessed the ability of pharmacological target adverse-­event
(TAE) profiles to predict AEs on US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) drug labels at least 4 years after approval. TAE profiles were generated by aggregating AEs from the FDA adverse event reporting system (FAERS) reports and the FDA drug
labels for drugs that hit a common target. A genetic algorithm (GA) was used to choose the adverse event (AE) case count
(N), disproportionality score in FAERS (proportional reporting ratio (PRR)), and percent of comparator drug labels with an AE
to maximize F-measure. With FAERS data alone, precision, recall, and specificity were 0.57, 0.78, and 0.61, respectively. After
including FDA drug label data, precision, recall, and specificity improved to 0.67, 0.81, and 0.71, respectively. Eighteen of 23
(78%) postmarket label changes were identified correctly. TAE analysis shows promise as a method to predict AEs at the time
of drug approval.

Study Highlights
WHAT IS THE CURRENT KNOWLEDGE ON THE
TOPIC?
✔ To date, predictive safety in the postmarket setting at
the FDA has relied upon expert review of available evidence from case reports, medical records, FAERS, and
the literature. Systemic, quantitative methods are being
evaluated.
WHAT QUESTION DID THIS STUDY ADDRESS?
✔ TAE profiles aggregate drug AEs by shared pharmacological targets. This study assesses the use of TAE profiles in anticipating significant postmarket drug AEs of
interest.

In 2016, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) received over 1.6 million adverse event (AE) reports and the
number of reports has increased yearly.1 Many of these AEs
are serious, including fatalities.2 Thus, drug AE prediction
would serve a critical public health need. Although clinical
trials may be a gold standard for detecting more common
AEs, these trials are often not of a sufficient size or duration
to detect rare or time-­dependent AEs that emerge when
the drug is used in clinical practice. Indeed, a recent review
of therapeutics approved by the FDA between 2001 and
2010 found that 32% of drugs experienced a postmarket
safety event, including withdrawal from the market, addition

WHAT DOES THIS STUDY ADD TO OUR KNOWLEDGE?
✔ This study confirms that aggregating AEs by pharmacological target is predictive of postmarket AEs.
HOW MIGHT THIS CHANGE DRUG DISCOVERY,
DEVELOPMENT, AND/OR THERAPEUTICS?
✔ In addition to assisting with postmarket pharmacovigilance, this approach may also be used to anticipate AEs
that may occur during drug development.

of a boxed warning, or an FDA-­issued safety communication.3 Additionally, the studied population may be highly
selective in a clinical trial. Because of exclusion criteria,
many concomitant medications and comorbidities may be
eliminated from a trial, leading to many potentially important drug interactions and AEs being missed. Furthermore,
with trials becoming smaller and more selective, increasing emphasis and importance is placed on postmarket
pharmacovigilance.
Traditional pharmacovigilance relies on data mining systems, such as the FDA adverse event reporting system
(FAERS)4 and the Sentinel Initiative4 to obtain information

about safety events once the drug is in the marketplace.
However, these methods are not predictive or proactive;
rather, they are reactive. A recent example is the FDA safety
communication regarding increased risk for serotonin syndrome and adrenal insufficiency with opioid use.5 To overcome these weaknesses, the center for drug evaluation
and research (CDER) has a strong interest in developing
predictive methods to assist in postmarket surveillance of
AEs. To date, there have been many efforts to predict AEs
using a variety of data, including FAERS reports,6,7 literature
reports,7,8 pathway/signaling,8,9 cheminformatics,6,8,9 and
chemogenomics data.8,9 Although many of these models are
promising, several are limited in drug or AE scope, accuracy,
or usage of proprietary data.
We have developed a model to predict AEs based on
pharmacological target adverse event (TAE) analysis. TAE
analysis aggregates AE reports from drugs that share molecular targets with a drug of interest. This model represents
a blend of approaches; it applies a mechanistic target analysis to an observational database. Here, we describe a pilot
study with six drugs of interest to assess the ability of TAE
analysis to predict postmarket AEs. We focus on a set of 43
AE categories of interest to regulators performing pharmacovigilance, referred to as designated medical events.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study overview
We performed a study to predict what AEs are listed on the
FDA label current to January 2017 using only data that were
available at the time of approval for the drug of interest.
This was performed with a multilabel classification method.
Predictions are generated by aggregating historical AEs
from comparator drugs that share receptor pharmacology
with a drug of interest. See Figure 1 for an overview of the
target analysis workflow.

Drugs chosen and generation of TAE profiles
Six drugs with at least 4 years postmarket experience were
chosen to represent a variety of therapeutic areas: certolizumab pegol, desvenlafaxine, etravirine, liraglutide, pazopanib, and rivaroxaban. The selected comparator drugs
with shared pharmacologic targets are listed below.
• Certolizumab: adalimumab
• Desvenlafaxine: duloxetine, venlafaxine
• Etravirine: delavirdine, didanosine, lamivudine, zalcitibine, zidovudine
• Liraglutide: exenatide
• Pazopanib: imatinib, palifermin, sorafenib, sunitinib
• Rivaroxaban: ardeparin, fondaparinux, heparin
See Table 1 for additional details of the TAE profiles that
were generated, which consist of the set of AEs associated
with a pharmacological target. The TAE profiles were generated separately by using data from the FAERS and the FDA
drug labels.
TAEs from the FAERS reports
TAE profiles from the FAERS reports were generated using
a bioinformatics tool, EFFECT.10 EFFECT aggregates the
FAERS reports by mapping the active ingredients recorded
in each case report to their respective pharmacological targets. The EFFECT knowledgebase can then be queried by
target or a set of targets or a set of comparator drugs with
shared targets to capture the subset of case reports, which
can then be used to generate TAE profiles.
The publicly available FAERS data used in this study was
mostly from 2004Q1 to 2015Q4. Within the data integration
process, the FAERS medication synonyms are mapped to
drugs and compounds in the DrugBank11 and PubChem.12
Based on this medication-­drug mapping the link to biomolecules and molecular mechanisms involved in pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics is established via UniProt13
and the pathway resources NCI Nature,14 Reactome,15
and BioCarta.16 Literature data is extracted based on co-­
occurrence of EFFECT entity names and synonyms in
PubMed17 abstracts. Drugs are classified according to the
Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical classification system.18
Indications and reactions are classified using the MedDRA
dictionary. Proportional reporting ratios (PRRs) are calculated using the approach described by van Puijenbroek
et al.19 In a manner analogous to the computation of PRRs
for drug AE pairs,19 2 × 2 contingency tables are generated
and disproportionality scores computed for TAE pairs. In
the case when multiple targets are used, disproportionality
is computed for subset-­AE pairs. For a more detailed description, see Schotland et al.20 and Racz et al.21 In the case
when multiple targets or comparator drugs are used, disproportionality is computed for subset-­AE pairs, as described
above via 2 × 2 contingency tables.
The resulting profile is a list of AEs coded as a medical dictionary for regulatory activities (MedDRA) Preferred
Terms,22 each with an associated case count (N) and disproportionality score (PRR with 95% confidence interval). The MedDRA terms were then mapped to a list of

designated medical events. Designated medical events
are MedDRA Preferred Terms grouped to capture similar
AEs into mechanistic-­related safety events. For example,
the MedDRA preferred terms “cerebral artery occlusion”
and “cerebral artery thrombosis” may be used by different
reporters to refer to the same AE. Thus, the combining of
MedDRA Preferred Terms into designated medical events
was designed to allow the aggregation of the FAERS reports to capture relevant medical events with similar etiologies and likely target-­
related mechanisms. Unlabeled
designated medical events represent key AEs that are followed by the FDA Office of Surveillance and Epidemiology
in the postmarket setting. The existing list was expanded
to a list of 43 categories (see Supporting Information for
the full list). Figure 2 contains a list of the 43 designated
medical events and their prevalence in the FAERS database and the FDA product labels. Roughly 900 (4%) of
MedDRA preferred terms were used and no term was used
more than once. The presence of one MedDRA preferred
term was sufficient to assign the designated medical event
to the TAE profile. See Table 2 for an example TAE profile
generated from the FAERS reports. The specific queries for
the six digital object identifiers (DOIs) can be found in Data
S1.
TAEs from the FDA drug labels
For each comparator drug, AEs were manually curated
from the most recent drug label published prior to the approval of the drug of interest and mapped to the MedDRA
vocabulary. Similarly to the profile from FAERS, MedDRA
preferred terms were mapped to the designated medical event list to create drug label TAE profiles. The mapping was performed such that the presence of only one

MedDRA preferred term was sufficient to assign the designated medical event to the TAE profile. Finally, for each
designated medical event, the proportion of comparator
drug labels reporting that designated medical event was
computed. See Table 3 for an example TAE profile generated from the FDA drug labels. Historical product labels were obtained from the National Library of Medicine
DailyMed website.4,13
Classification and decision tree analysis
We used classification and decision tree analysis23 to construct a multilabel decision tree such that TAE profiles (independent variables) were used to predict the approved
product label of a drug of interest (dependent variable).
The dependent variables to be predicted consisted of 43
designated medical events described earlier. There was
no restriction on the number or combination of designated
medical events to be predicted. Three features were used
to construct the decision tree: N (FAERS case count),
PRR025 (the lower bound of the PRR 95% confidence
interval), and the proportion of comparator drug labels
with AE (label score). For TAE profiles generated from the
FAERS data, a designated medical event was considered
a prediction if N and PRR025 were both greater than specified threshold (split) value. For profiles generated from
drug labels, a designated medical event was considered
a prediction if label score was greater than a specified
threshold value.
Predicted designated medical events were compared to
designated medical events on the current FDA drug label.
Metrics evaluated include precision (positive predictive
value), recall (sensitivity or true positive rate), specificity
(true negative rate), and F1 (harmonic mean of precision

and recall). Precision, recall, and F1 were computed as follows and macro-­averaged across the six study drugs where
DME = designated medical event:
Precision =prob(DME is positive|DME is predicted)
= True positives/Predicted Positives

Recall =prob(DME is predicted|DME is positive)
= True positives/Positives
F1 = 2 ∗ Precision ∗ Recall∕(Precision + Recall)
A genetic algorithm (GA) was used to choose threshold
(split) values for N, PRR025, and label score to maximize
macro-­averaged F1 across study drugs. The GA parameters
were: mutation rate, 0.2; crossover rate, 0.8; population size,
100; elitism, 20; and maximum iterations, 1000. The R package GA was used to perform the calculations.24 Full details
are provided as R code in Data S2. Please see TA_pilot.Rmd
or TA_pilot.Rproj.
In total, three classification analyses were performed:
(i) predictions were made from TAE profiles generated
from the FAERS data only; (ii) predictions were made
from TAE profiles generated from the FDA product label
data only; (iii) predictions were made from TAE profiles
generated from both FAERS data and the FDA product
labels.

Safety label changes
For each of the six drugs in the study, the original drug label
was compared to the current label to identify label changes.
Twenty-­three new designated medical event label changes
were identified across the six drugs. Label changes were
compared to classification and decision tree predictions
made at maximum F1 and the percentage identified correctly was computed.
RESULTS
Classification performance
Classification and decision tree analysis was performed for
three data sets: (i) TAE profiles generated from the FAERS
data only; (ii) TAE profiles generated from label data only;
(iii) TAEs generated from a combination of the FAERS and
the FDA drug labels (Table 4). For FAERS-­only TAE profiles, the algorithm chose N = 70 and PRR025 = 1.06 to
maximize F1 to 0.64 (Table 4, row 1). Precision, recall, and
specificity were 0.57, 0.78, and 061, respectively. For label-­
only TAE profiles, the algorithm chose label score = 0.18 to
maximize F1 to 0.68 (Table 4, row 2). Precision, recall, and
specificity were 0.67, 0.75, and 0.72, respectively. Combing
the FAERS and label data, the algorithm chose N = 170,
PRR025 = 1.52, and label score = 0.45 to maximize F1
to 0.71 (Table 4, row 3). Precision, recall, and specificity
were 0.67, 0.81, and 0.71, respectively. Overall, there was

lower bound of 95% confidence interval; TAE, target adverse-­event profile(s) used.
Performance is compared for three sets of predictions: (i) target-­adverse events profiles generated from FAERS data only; (ii) target-­adverse events profiles
generated from the FDA label data only; (iii) target-­adverse events generated from a combination of the FAERS and the FDA labels. A genetic algorithm was
used to specify N, PRR025, and label score to maximize F1.

For each drug of interest, the original drug label was compared to the current label. Twenty-­three new DMEs were identified across the six drugs.
These label changes were then compared to classification predictions
made at maximum F1. The percentage of label changes identified is shown
on the bottom row.

Although there has been great interest in applying predictive methods to the problem of drug safety,25 our method
has unique aspects that make it relevant to AE predictions
at the time of drug approval. Kuhn et al.26 and Wang et al.9
so predict AEs on drug labels by integrating drug-­
target
data with the FAERS data27; however, they do not focus
on predicting designated medical events. Additionally, Xu
and Wang7 relies heavily on LINCS L1000 gene expression
data, which may not be available for new molecular entities.

Finally, several methodologies focus on one class of AEs or
specific drug-­AE associations7,28,29; our methodology is distinctive in that we can predict a wide range of clinically significant AEs for any drug that has a comparator with similar
target activities at the time of approval.
Predictions were made at maximum F1, which is the harmonic mean of precision and recall. The method, however,
can be tuned to maximize recall (sensitivity) at the expense
of specificity or precision (positive predictive value). The
tunability and granularity of the method can be considered
a strength. In fact, tuning to greater recall (sensitivity) may
be useful to identify AEs for augmented pharmacovigilance
activities. In practice, further mechanistic evaluations of the
target’s relationship to an AE and literature reports for the
association are evaluated to support or lessen the strength
of a prediction. Unlabeled signals for comparator drugs
have been identified in the process, as an additional benefit
of this methodology.
As with any method using voluntary postmarket reporting
data, such as FAERS, under-­reporting or over-­reporting biases and stimulated reporting occur.30 However, FAERS and
other postmarketing databases have successfully predicted
AEs in several other models.31,32 The strength of FAERS is
the enhanced reporting of rare events as captured by our
designated medical event list that are not identified in trials. Additionally, we have addressed potential biases from
FAERS by adding molecular TAE profiles generated from
comparator FDA drug labels. This reflects other methodologies, such as those developed by Gurulingappa et al.32
and Liu,33 in which multiple sources were used as features
to make one prediction for a drug-­AE association. The addition of the FDA drug labels to our methodology allowed
the algorithm to choose higher values of N and PRR025,
thereby reducing false-­positive predictions from the FAERS-­
generated TAE profiles and improving specificity and precision. An additional limitation is the sample size of six drugs,
which is too small to perform cross-­validation for estimation
of generalization error; the resulting model must, therefore,
be understood as hypothesis generating. A larger validation
study is underway.
Several future enhancements and analyses are planned
to further strengthen and determine overall performance.
First, false-­positive predictions, or predictions made that
were not on the label of the drug of interest, will be systematically and mechanistically analyzed using multiple
sources. This will allow us to determine if this methodology identified AEs that may be of concern, but have not yet

been recognized using current pharmacovigilance methods. Moreover, we are currently investigating additional
features for prediction, including the likelihood-­ratio test34
and a third source, text-­mined AEs from literature. We are
also investigating the possibility of developing a database
for common indications and comorbidities to reduce confounding and false-­
positive predictions from the FAERS
data. Additionally, we are presently developing improved
methodology incorporating multiple machine learning approaches to enhance the applicability, accuracy, and reliability of our model. We also plan to include drug structure
and target similarity measures as features for machine
learning. Last, we are planning to increase the sample size
to further validate our model. A larger study will allow us to
cross-­validate with independent test data, as well as assess
model performance by subgroup (e.g., AE and number of
comparator drugs).
TAE analysis shows promise as a predictive method to
augment pharmacovigilance. With this approach, using the
FAERS data and the FDA drug labels for comparator drugs
that share pharmacological targets with a drug of interest,
we can tune our classification performance metrics based
on three predictors: number of FAERS cases, PRR025 in
FAERS, and percent of comparator drug labels with the AE
of interest. This allows us to choose metrics best suited for
safety reviewers, such as increasing precision to allow for
better decision making. With several additional enhancements and analyses to better quantify performance of this
methodology on the horizon, this pilot study demonstrates
promise for this approach. In summary, this informatics
approach using real-­world data shows applicability to provide mechanistic data for drug safety evaluations for unlabeled AEs.
