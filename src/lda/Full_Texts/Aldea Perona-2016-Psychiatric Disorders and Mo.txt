Abstract
Introduction In 2008, the US FDA issued an alert about
an increased risk of psychiatric events associated with
montelukast. Recent national pharmacovigilance analyses
in Sweden, France and Spain detected a potential increase
in reporting risk of the association.
Aim Our objective was to analyse spontaneous reports of
psychiatric events in children and adolescents worldwide
treated with montelukast.
Methods We conducted a retrospective analysis of Individual Case Safety Reports (ICSRs) recorded up to 1
January 2015 in the World Health Organization (WHO)
database (VigiBase), in which montelukast was associated with ‘psychiatric disorders’. We used the Bayesian
Confidence Propagation Neural Network (BCPNN)
approach for signal generation.
Results A total of 14,670 ICSRs for montelukast were
recorded, of which 2630 corresponded to psychiatric disorders in people aged \18 years. The main symptoms
reported for infants (aged \2 years) were sleep disorders,
for children (aged 2–11 years) the main symptoms were
depression/anxiety, and for adolescents (aged 12–17 years)
they were suicidal behaviour and depression/anxiety. Suicidal behaviour was over-represented in all age groups with

information component (IC) values that reached 5.01 in
children and 3.85 in adolescents. Unexpectedly, completed
suicides were reported more frequently for children (IC:
3.15; IC025: 1.98) than for adolescents (IC: 3.11; IC025:
2.61) or the total population (IC 1.95; IC025: 1.73).
Conclusions Neuropsychiatric disorders as side effects of
montelukast were more frequently reported for children
than for adults. Infants and children seem to be more prone
to sleep disturbances, whereas adolescents present symptoms of depression/anxiety and psychotic reactions more
often. Suicidal behaviour and completed suicide appear to
be more frequently reported than previously thought in
practice. Risk management plans and epidemiological
studies are needed to quantify the risk. Practitioners should
be aware of the risk of neuropsychiatric events associated
with montelukast use, and should advise the patient and
report new cases.

Key Points
Since the US FDA alert in 2008, psychiatric events
associated with montelukast use have been reported
worldwide.
Psychiatric disorders associated with montelukast
use, especially suicidal behavior, have been reported
more often than expected in children and adolescents
during the last decade.
Prescribers must be aware of the neuropsychiatric
risk involved, advise the patient and report new
cases.

1 Introduction
Montelukast is a selective leukotriene type I receptor
antagonist that has been available since 1998. It is used as
preventive medicine to reduce the frequency of asthma
exacerbation in children with mild–moderate asthma. The
use of montelukast is more frequent in children than in
adults because it has been authorized by the US FDA and
national European regulatory agencies to relieve symptoms
of rhinitis and asthma in young patients, from 6 months of
age in perennial allergic rhinitis or 12 months of age in
those requiring chronic treatment of asthma and in other
clinical situations. Furthermore, the pharmaceutical forms
of montelukast—granules and chewable tablets—are easier
for children to take than inhaled anti-asthmatic drugs.
In 2008, the FDA issued a warning about an increased
risk of neuropsychiatric events associated with the use of
antileukotriene agents: montelukast and zafirlukast (leukotriene receptor antagonists) and zileuton (leukotriene
synthesis inhibitor) [1, 2]. The FDA and the manufacturers
reviewed all the information from the clinical trials and
some post-marketing cases [3–6] and issued an update in
the ‘precautions’ section of the prescribing information to
include neuropsychiatric events reported in patients using
these products [7]. The European Medicines Agency
(EMA) adopted a modification of an agreed ‘Paediatric
Investigation Plan’ for montelukast in October 2009, and
national regulatory agencies introduced neuropsychiatric
events as rare adverse reactions in the post-marketing
experience [8, 9].
A recent quantitative analysis by Wallerstedt et al. [10]
and Bygdell et al. [11] of the Adverse Drug Reaction
Swedish database (SWEDIS) also detected a potential
increased reporting risk of neuropsychiatric events in
children. The same tendency was detected in other national
pharmacovigilance databases such as the ‘Association
française des centres régionaux de pharmacovigilance’ [12]
and the ‘Sistema Español de Farmacovigilancia’ [13].
Since 1978, the Uppsala Monitoring Centre (UMC), a
World Health Organization (WHO) Collaborating Centre,
has been the focal point of independent global pharmacovigilance. VigiBase is the largest and most comprehensive data resource in the world; it is developed and
maintained by the UMC on behalf of the WHO.
As of September 2015, a total of 122 countries have
joined the WHO Programme for International Drug Monitoring [14]. VigiBase is the name of the WHO Global
Individual Case Safety Report (ICSR) database; it consists
of reports of adverse reactions received from member
countries at least quarterly. VigiBase is continuously
updated with incoming ICSRs. Currently, the database
stores more than 11 million records and has been used for

A. Aldea Perona et al.

the early detection of signals, updating Product Safety
Update Reports (PSURs) and comparison of reports in
company databases [15].
The main objective of this study was to analyse the
profile of psychiatric events in the paediatric population
treated with montelukast reported to the WHO Global
ICSR database. The hypothesis was that there is an
increased association reported worldwide between the use
of montelukast and psychiatric disorders in children and
adolescents than in the global population (including
adults).

2 Methods
We carried out a retrospective analysis of spontaneously
reported cases of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) from the
international WHO global ICSRs database, VigiBase.
ICSRs concerning montelukast use in individuals aged
\18 years were preselected.
Eligible cases for the analysis were all ICSRs received
up to 1 January 2015 in which montelukast (as a single or
multiple ingredient in the R03DC Anatomical Therapeutic
Chemical [ATC] group, whether suspicious or not) was
associated with the System Organ Class (SOC) term
‘psychiatric disorders’, which is the most frequently notified SOC term for montelukast, especially in people aged
\18 years. The percentage of notifications with the association psychiatric or nervous disorders and montelukast
was evaluated. The paediatric population was classified
into three main groups: infants (aged \2 years); children
(2–11 years) and adolescents (12–17 years), according to
ICH (International Conference on Harmonization of
Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use) Topic E 11 [16]. The association with
psychiatric disorders was explored for other anti-asthmatic
drugs such as R01AD corticosteroids and R03A adrenergic
inhalants in absolute numbers.
The information contained in case reports consists of
administrative data and information about patients, ADRs
and medication. ADRs are coded according to MedDRA
(the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities). These
medical terms are classified in five levels of structural
hierarchy [17]: SOC, high-level group terms (HLGT),
high-level terms (HLT), preferred terms (PT) and lowestlevel terms (LLT).
MedDRA also includes Standardised MedDRA Queries (SMQ), which are collections of MedDRA terms
consistent with a description of a clinical syndrome associated with an adverse reaction and a drug exposure, useful
for global searches. For further analysis, the PT included
within HLGTs shown below were reclassified into four

Psychiatric Disorders and Montelukast in Children

main categories (not all terms were included in an specific
SMQ, and it was indicated):
•

•

•

•

Depression/anxiety Including the PT from the following HLGTs: ‘Anxiety disorders and symptoms’, ‘Depressed mood disorders and disturbances’ and ‘Mood
disorders and disturbances’. This group was identical to
the SMQ for montelukast and paediatric population
searches.
Psychosis and psychotic disorders Including the HLGT
in relation with the PT, typically medication induced:
‘Deliria (including confusion)’, ‘Disturbances in thinking and perception’ and ‘Cognitive and attention
disorders and disturbances’.
Suicide/self-injury Including PT from the HLGT:
‘Suicidal and self-injurious behaviour’. This group
was identical to the SMQ, excluding ‘intentional
overdose’.
Sleep disorders No SMQ was available for this
category. The HLGT included was ‘Sleep disorders
and disturbances’. This HLGT includes HLTs that
cover all aspects of sleep disorders.

The ICSRs were classified as serious or not serious, and
unknown when this information was missing.
The UMC performs a statistical analysis of the old and
new ADR reports every quarter with a Bayesian Confidence Propagation Neural Network (BCPNN) [18]. This
method is effective in identifying possible signals, and it
was applied in this study because it allows the inclusion of
low count values and the results can be calculated despite
missing data. The analysis provides the strength of
dependency between a drug and an ADR and is calculated
using a logarithmic measure of disproportionality called
the ‘Information Component’ (IC) [19]. The IC gives a
measure of the disproportionality between the expected and
the reported rate of ADRs for a given drug. An IC value of
0 indicates drug–ADR combinations for which the number
of observed cases is the same as that which might be
expected from the overall reporting in the dataset. Positive
values (IC [0) represent combinations reported more frequently, and negative values more infrequently, than
expected. Confidence intervals of the IC are calculated to
account for sampling variability. An IC025 with positive
lower 95 % confidence limit (95 % low) indicates a statistically significant disproportionality between the expected and the reported rate for a drug and an ADR. A high IC
value in addition to a lower 95 % confidence limit denotes
a strong association between the drug and the ADR [20] in
the database.
The IC and IC025 were calculated by quarters for each
age group, and adult cases were also considered for comparative evaluation. The time to onset of the events (mean,
median, minimum and maximum values), the outcome

71

(recovered, recovered with sequelae, recovering, not
recovered, unknown) and the de-challenge effect were
analysed. ES is a member of the Signal Review Panel of
the UMC, and the authors accepted the conditions for use
stated in the UMC caveat document [21].

3 Results
A total of 10,305,720 ADR reports were registered in
VigiBase up to 1 January 2015: 1,023,414 ICSRs
involved people aged \18 years, and 97,222 ICSRs
reported psychiatric disorders. The total number of ICSRs
for montelukast was 14,670. The most common SOC
reported for montelukast was ‘psychiatric disorders’, which
were reported in 5277 ICSRs (36 % of all ICSRs for
montelukast), of which 2630 (50 % of psychiatric disorders
for montelukast) corresponded to individuals aged
\18 years (114 ICSRs aged \2 years; 2007 ICSRs aged
2–11 years; 509 ICSRs aged [11 years). The reports came
from 49 countries.
The second most frequently reported SOC term for
montelukast was ‘nervous system disorders’, which
accounted for 24 % of all ICSRs for the drug (3460 ICSRs,
of which 1225 corresponded to individuals aged
\18 years). Altogether, effects on the central nervous
system (CNS) accounted for 60 % of all ADRs reported for
montelukast.
The psychiatric disorders reported in relation to other
anti-asthmatic drugs were as follows. As at 1 January 2015,
a total of 102,480 ICSRs had been notified for corticosteroids (R01AD), only 7 % of which were related to psychiatric disorders. For adrenergic inhalants (R03A), 97,951
ICSRs were reported in the same period, and only 7 %
were related to psychiatric disorders.
Boys were over-represented (1651; 63 %) compared
with girls (938; 36 %; 2 % unknown) in the paediatric age
range (\18 years). The percentage of male versus female
sex for each age group was as follows: infants 63/37;
children 67/32 and adolescents 48/52. This contrasts with
the male/female proportion in adults (29/70).
The most common HLGT in the ‘psychiatric disorders’
SOC category associated with montelukast in the paediatric
population (\18 years) were ‘Personality disorders and
disturbances in behaviour’ (955; 36 %), ‘Sleep disorders
and disturbances’ (957; 36 %), ‘Mood disorders and disturbances’ (955; 36 %), ‘Anxiety disorders and symptoms’
(823; 31 %), ‘Suicidal and self-injurious behaviours’ (674;
26 %) and ‘Depressed mood disorders and disturbances’
(608; 23 %). All the HLGTs of the ‘psychiatric disorders’
SOC category are described in Fig. 1. As most of the
ICSRs included more than one ADR, the number of ADRs
is higher than the number of ICSRs, and the proportions

refer to the total number of ICSRs considered for this
analysis (2630 ICSRs for psychiatric disorders in people
aged \18 years).
The percentage of serious cases in each group is shown
in Annex 1 (see the Electronic Supplementary Material
[ESM] 1). There were 26 fatal cases with depression/anxiety involving all age groups, and 183 ISCRs including
completed suicide, as shown in Annex 2 (see the ESM 2).
The total number of reports and the IC (IC025) values
for the four topics in the different age groups are shown in
the Annex tables 3–6 (see ESM 3). The temporal trend of
the IC values for the four main topics and the different age
groups were calculated for the period up to October 2013
and appear in Figs 2, 3, 4 and 5.
All topics reached IC values higher than zero for all
paediatric groups after 2008 (when the first FDA signal was
published [1, 2]) and continue to rise to date. There were

significant differences between age groups. Children
(2–11 years) had the highest IC values for ‘Suicidal
behaviour’ and ‘Sleep disorders’, and ‘Depressive and
psychotic symptoms’. In all cases, the IC for paediatric
populations was higher than for adults. Data corresponding
to infants are difficult to analyse due to the low absolute
number of reports, and IC values are therefore around zero
or negative, except for ‘Sleep disorders’, where infant IC
values are similar to those of the other paediatric groups.
IC values are much higher than expected for all groups
as from the year 2000, 2 years after introduction to the
market, and increased significantly after the FDA signal.
For suicidal behaviour, the IC increased in 2005 and rose
further in 2008.
ICSRs reporting ‘Sleep disorders’ are abundant (746
cases), and the IC is higher in all paediatric groups than in
adults, with children aged 2–11 years being most

frequently involved. For this group, IC values are higher
than zero as from 1999 and increasing steadily. Sleep
disorders is the only HLGT that has been reported for
infants (\2 years) in numbers that allow for interpretation,
and the IC value reached 2.65 in this group. ‘Sleep terror’
and ‘nightmare’ were the PTs with the greatest disproportionality: IC 6.51 and 4.54, respectively. The most
frequent concomitant medications were salbutamol 14 %,
fluticasone 9 %, cetirizine 6 %, budesonide 6 % and fluticasone propionate/salmeterol 5 %.
Depression/anxiety was reported in as many ICSRs as
was sleep disorders, despite not being as widely recognized. The IC was similar for children and adolescents, but
it was almost twice the IC for adults. For children (aged
2–11 years), the IC values were over zero as from the year

73

2000, and for adolescents it increased dramatically after the
publication of the signal in 2008 and continues to be high.
Psychosis and psychotic disorders are difficult to diagnose in paediatric populations but have been consistently
reported since the year 2000, especially for children (aged
2–11 years). The IC for adolescents rose sharply in the year
2009 after the signal, and has been increasing since then.
The data for ‘Suicide/self-injury’ have been carefully
reviewed up to 1 January 2015, with special attention given
to the ICSRs that reported ‘completed suicide’. In the
global WHO database, 6722 ICSRs are for the ‘Suicidal
and self-injurious behaviours’ HLGT for all drugs in the
paediatric population. Of these, 10 % (674) correspond to a
single drug: montelukast. The HLGT ‘Suicidal and selfinjurious behaviours’ related to montelukast included several PT: Suicidal ideation (447; 66 %), Suicide attempt
(95; 14 %), Intentional self-injury (60; 9 %), Completed
suicide (56; 7 %), Self-injurious ideation (44; 7 %), Selfinjurious behaviour (44; 7 %) and Suicidal behaviour (27;
4 %). The most frequent concomitant drugs were inhaled
corticosteroids (budesonide, mometasone) and beta-adrenergic agents, at 2 % to 27 %, respectively in children.
For the ‘Suicidal and self-injurious behaviours’ HLGT,
the PTs ‘Completed suicide’ (82 %) and ‘Suicide attempt’
(78 %) were more frequently reported for adolescents, and
suicidal ideation (66 %) were more frequently reported for
children.
Annex 2 (see the ESM 2) shows the total number of
ICSRs, the number of ICSRs of positive de-challenge
cases, the number of positive re-challenge cases, the fatal
cases and the IC in each age group. It highlights that suicidal ideation, aggression, suicide attempt or depression
account for 52, 44, 22 and 48 % of ISCRs with positive dechallenge, respectively.
Data on duration of treatment, onset of reaction and
recovery are presented in annexes 7 and 8 (see ESM 4).
Information is limited to approximately one-third of the
cases. The median time to onset varies from hours or a few
days for sleep disorders and psychotic disorders, to one to
several weeks for depression disturbances. For the suicidal
category, the median time to onset is much higher, ranging
from months to years.
Data on the ‘recovering’ situation are also displayed in
annexes 7 and 8 (see ESM 4); the information about
recovery is sparse (20–50 % of cases) and when known,
most patients recovered after discontinuing the medication.
After reviewing the reports and excluding duplicates
(seven ISCRs), there were 35 cases of ‘Completed suicide’
associated with montelukast. The most common concomitant medication in ‘Completed suicide’ ICSRs were
corticosteroids (budesonide, fluticasone, fluticasone/salmeterol; ten ICSRs) and beta-adrenergic agonists (salbutamol; seven ICSRs). For ‘Completed suicide’ ICSRs, the

74

duration of treatment was reported in 11 cases, varying
from less than a year in two cases to more than 2 years in
nine ICSRs.

4 Discussion
Once a signal has been detected, it needs to be followed up,
and further analysis of the database can provide strength
and new information to be considered [22]. The term
‘Psychiatric disorder’ is the most frequent SOC reported in
relation to montelukast use (36 %) in the VigiBase
database, followed by the SOC ‘CNS’ (24 %), which, when
combined, account for 60 % of all ADRs reported for this
drug. This was described in 2012 by Bygdell et al. [11],
who analysed ADRs in the paediatric population reported
over a 10-year period in the Swedish ADRs database, and
described the psychiatric disorders associated with all kind
of drugs used in children. Montelukast was included in that
analysis, but cases were few, and the authors could not
show relevant age and sex differences in the association of
montelukast with psychiatric disorders. However, in that
analysis, the association between psychiatric disorders and
montelukast was reported to VigiBase, from 49 different
countries, more frequently than with other anti-asthmatic
drugs such as adrenergic inhalants and corticosteroids.
These findings strengthen the signal.
The present study about montelukast and psychiatric
disorders analyses the largest collection of data on ICSRs.
The analysis was performed grouping the ICSRs into four
main groups for two reasons: the ICSRs include little
information about the clinical record of the patient, and it is
difficult to establish a confirmed diagnosis, so some of the
diagnoses could overlap.
Differences exist in the frequency of ICSRs reported
according to age groups. The main symptoms reported for
infants (aged \2 years) were sleep disorders, whereas for
children (aged 2–11 years), it was depression/anxiety and
sleep disorders, and for adolescents (aged 12–17 years) they
were depression/anxiety and suicidal behaviour. Suicidal
behaviour was over-represented in all age groups, with IC
values [ 3 in all cases. No clear sex differences were found.
Sleep disorders are well known and are recognized in
Patient Information Leaflets (PILs) and the Summary of
Product Characteristics (SmPC) [7–9]. The IC value
was [ 2 in all age groups, and was higher in children aged
\11 years than in adolescents. Psychiatric symptoms are
difficult to evaluate in children aged\2 years of age and so
few ICSRs are reported to the database. Nevertheless, sleep
disorders are also well reported and acknowledged for this
group, whereas the paucity of data and the difficulties of
interpretation for other symptoms prevent any analysis for
infants aged \2 years.

A. Aldea Perona et al.

‘Sleep terror’ and ‘Nightmare’ were the most frequently
reported psychiatric ADRs, as in the analysis of the
SWEDIS database during the period 2001–2010 [11]. Antiasthmatic drugs are administered to control nocturnal
asthma symptoms; however, most of them produce sleep
disturbances. It is therefore difficult to evaluate causality,
because these drugs are commonly used together [23].
The ‘Depression’ category presents an IC twice as high
for children as for adults. This IC value has been high for
children (aged 2–11 years) since 1998 and had increased
from 1 to 2.8 in 2009, and has continued to increase
slightly since then. Asthma has been associated with
depression, and it is difficult to evaluate the possible contributing factors: the influence of the disease, the concomitant presence of depression and the role of the drug in
the presence of symptoms [24, 25]. Nevertheless, the high
and stable association over time between the use of montelukast and the presence of depressive/anxiety symptoms
in children needs to be seriously considered and cannot be
ruled out.
Conversely, psychotic symptoms are quite rare in the
paediatric population. There is a strong association
between the use of montelukast and reports of psychotic
symptoms, especially in those aged 2–11 years (IC: 2.66)
and in adolescents (IC: 1.61). IC values have increased
steadily since 2008. The corresponding IC value for adults
is 0.6. This disproportion points towards a causal relationship and a higher predisposition in children. The fact
that montelukast is more widely used in children than in
adults might influence the notification rate of ADRs, but
the difference is high enough to consider a higher reporting
risk of psychotic side effects in young children.
The data on ‘suicidal behaviour’ are striking. IC values
reached 5.01 in children (aged 2–11 years) and 3.85 in
adolescents, and have been increasing, especially in adolescents. The IC value for adults is lower (2.8). The category suicidal behaviour includes several PTs in relation
with self-injury and attempted/completed suicide. We
performed a further analysis of the 35 ICSRs reporting
completed suicides, which was more frequently reported
for children (aged 2–11 years; IC: 3.15) than for adolescents (IC: 3.11) and the total population (IC: 1.95). In
VigiBase, the suicide and self-injury terms were labelled
as serious in all the age groups for 85–90 % of cases.
Furthermore, there were 26 fatal cases with depression
involving all age groups, but there were seven times more
completed suicide reports. The positive de-challenge in
ideation, attempted suicide or self-injurious behaviours, or
the positive re-challenge in a few cases, support the urgent
need for more studies on the magnitude of this association.
Several epidemiological studies have analysed the association between chronic diseases, and asthma in particular,
with suicidal behaviour [26]. Only a few studies have

Psychiatric Disorders and Montelukast in Children

focused on individuals aged \18 years [27, 28]. A recent
review of the evidence from observational data supports
the hypothesis of an association between asthma and suicide-related behaviour (ideation, attempts and completion)
in the general population. As Iessa et al. [29] concluded,
‘‘epidemiological studies, with more objective measures
and larger sample sizes, adjusting for a wider scope of
suicide-related confounding factors (e.g. comorbidities),
and with a longitudinal design, are needed for a more
conclusive answer’’. Nevertheless, the high disproportion
of reports involving children, especially when compared
with the reports for adults, the positive de-challenge and rechallenge of the drug in some cases, and the fact that the
prescriber associated the unexpected outcome with the
drug suggests that the suicidal behaviour cannot be based
solely on this possible association with the disease.
The time from exposure to ADR was described as less
than 1 week in the Swedish [10] analysis, but the results of
this analysis in VigiBase showed the time to onset varied
from days to years: a few days in relation to sleep disorders, agitation and nervousness, and months to years in
relation to depression and suicide-related behaviour.
The IC values in the paediatric population could be
influenced by several biases. On the one hand, montelukast
is more frequently used in this population than in adults
and thus more reports for children would be expected.
However, the IC values for adults are also consistently high
for all four categories (‘Depression/anxiety’, ‘Psychosis
and psychotic disorders’, ‘Suicide/self-injury’ and ‘Sleep
disorders’). Furthermore, IC value is a measure of disproportionality that is compared against each age group;
therefore, despite the absolute numbers of cases, the IC
value indicates a higher reporting risk of ADR and the
drug.
Another bias, especially related to suicidal behaviour
reports, may be the well-known presence of sleep disorders, which could lead to infra-notification, against the
dramatic nature of suicidal behaviour, which could lead to
higher notification. Furthermore, sleep disorders are common and well acknowledged with montelukast, and this
could influence the causality association (a form of notoriety bias) [30]. However, the IC for suicidal behaviour is
very high, as it is for adults. Thus, although this bias cannot
be completely ruled out, it would not substantially change
the interpretation of the data.
IC values have risen since the FDA warning in 2008.
That warning was based on the re-analysis of the clinical
trials data and some post-marketing cases. Opinions
between the health authorities, FDA and EMA, and the
prescribers are currently diverse [31]. In 2014, the FDA
analysed post-marketing cases in the paediatric population
and maintained the warnings and precautions in the Labeled
Safety issues for prescribers: ‘‘Patients and prescribers

75

should be alert for neuropsychiatric events. Patients should
be instructed to notify their prescriber if these changes
occur. Prescribers should carefully evaluate the risks and
benefits of continuing treatment with montelukast sodium if
such events occur’’ [32]. The current analysis goes further
and is based on spontaneous reports from all over the world
after many years of post-marketing. In this regard, the
analysis reinforces the cautionary communication from the
FDA and may provide more explanations on the differing
susceptibilities between age groups.
It is difficult to link the pharmacological action of
montelukast with the development of neuro-psychiatric
symptoms. Montelukast is a specific leukotriene type I
(CysLT1) receptor antagonist [33]. The distribution of the
Cystenil receptors LT1 and LT2 differs, and only CysLT2
receptors are present in the CNS, whereas CysLT1 are
distributed in lung smooth muscle cells, interstitial lung
macrophages and the spleen. In fact, the affinity of montelukast for the CysLT2 receptor of the brain is very low
[34]. Currently, there is no biological explanation for direct
effects of montelukast on the CNS.
4.1 Strengths and Limitations
The analysis of spontaneous ADR reports has several
limitations as well as clear strengths. The goal of the
spontaneous reporting system and the analysis of data
collection in VigiBase is clearly defined: to look for
signal generation and not for quantification of risks, as the
data do not allow for a calculation of true frequencies. This
system allows the generation of new hypotheses and new
ways to study the true association adjusting for confounding factors. The absolute number of reports cannot be
directly linked to the prevalence of the ADR in a given
population; this database is useful to explore the disproportionality of ADR reports for a drug, and IC values give
information on associations and risks, more than on
causality or prevalence changes.
Confounding biases are also possible in the analysis.
Montelukast is more commonly used in children than in
adults, so the probability of receiving more reports on the
paediatric population is also higher. Furthermore, sleep
disorders are common, whereas suicidal behaviours are
rare, possibly prompting a higher reporting rate. In addition, asthma has been linked with suicidal behaviour,
although not definitively, and the concomitant cause cannot
be ruled out completely. Finally, the FDA alert prompted a
sudden high level of reporting of suicidal behaviours in
patients receiving antileukotriene agents.
A major drawback of this paper is that it does not report
anything regarding physical or psychiatric conditions or
disorders in the children of this cohort. Obviously, if the
patient has an existing psychiatric diagnosis, this is critical

76

A. Aldea Perona et al.

information to have before attributing a psychiatric effect
to a medication. Moreover, the diagnosis of psychiatric
disturbances is difficult in young children, and one must be
cautious in the interpretation of some psychiatric disorders
according to MedDRA codes.
However, this analysis of VigiBase also has several
strengths. The data are collected from sources all over the
world and represent cases that individual physicians consider sufficiently important to report them to the national
and international pharmacovigilance system. These data
reflect the use of anti-asthmatic drugs in real life, outside
clinical trials and years after their introduction to the
market. Few drugs outside the psychotropic agents display
a main neuropsychiatric drug reaction such as montelukast.
IC values are a measure of disproportionality that is
stable for a given pair of drug side effects, and within a
population group (age, origin, etc.). Thus, the higher the IC
value, the more frequent, and disproportionate, the report of
the association. The IC values rose immediately after the
FDA warning some 6 years ago, but instead of falling after
the warning, the rate of reports of neuropsychiatric events
for montelukast has steadily rising for all those years. The
IC values for the association of montelukast with depression, psychotic symptoms and suicidal behaviour in the
different groups of (paediatric) ages, are very high. Many
well-known side effects for other drugs have IC values
lower than those obtained in this study, and signals with
much lower IC values have prompted intense actions from
regulators, resulting in changes to authorization processes
and information for professionals. For example, in
November 1999, the association between Nimesulide and
hepatotoxicity had an IC of 0.54 with ten ICSRs. The SmPC
was modified in late 1999. In September 2000, infliximab
and tuberculosis had an IC of 0.54 with four ICSRs. Consequently, the SmPC was modified in Europe. The signal
was evaluated for 2 years and, in 2002, the IC was 4.32 (IC:
3.6–5.1). In April 1999, the IC for cerivastatin and rhabdomyolysis was 1.52 with seven ICSRs. The drug was
withdrawn, but the signal was followed for 2 years. In
August 2002, the CI was 4.7 (IC 95 %: 4.4–5.1) [35].
Therefore, despite the study limitations, this signal
cannot be ruled out without further analysis of the
association.

that montelukast could be linked with a higher prevalence
of neuropsychiatric symptoms than currently recognized,
although the data and the methods cannot quantify it. The
analysis also revealed that neuropsychiatric disorders are
more frequently reported for children than for adults, and
that there are differences between age groups. Infants and
young children seem to be prone to sleep disturbances,
whereas older children and adolescents present more
cases of depressive and anxiety symptoms and psychotic
reactions. Suicidal behaviour and completed suicide seem
to be more frequently reported than recognized in
practice.
As stated by the FDA, safety concerns have been raised
regarding the increased risk of neuropsychiatric adverse
events, including suicide and suicide attempts, with the use
of montelukast. ‘‘However, there continues to be a lack of
well-designed epidemiologic studies that can lead to the
quantification of the suicide/suicide attempt risk level
among patients using montelukast’’ [32]. De Boer [36] also
highlights that this type of design does not allow for
causality evaluation or quantification but is useful to indicate areas in which other types of pharmaco-epidemiological approaches are needed.
This database is useful to explore ADRs reported, and
IC values give information on the disproportionality
between cases reported and those expected in the database,
more than on causality or prevalence changes. Other epidemiological methods should be applied to quantify the
risk, to attempt to define the true differences in the age
groups, adjusting for a wider scope of suicide-related
confounding factors. Due to difficulties in investigating the
risk of suicidal behaviour in children and adolescents, the
most appropriate approach may be to combine various
strategies, such as disproportionality analysis, risk management plans, epidemiological studies and even animal
experimental studies. Meanwhile, prescribers should carefully evaluate the potential risks and benefits of continuing
treatment with montelukast and should advise the patient
and report new cases.

5 Conclusion

Compliance with Ethical Standards

Psychiatric symptoms, especially sleep disturbances, are
widely recognized as side effects of montelukast, and this
information is given in the SmPC of the drug. The present
study analysed the distribution of different types of psychiatric symptoms associated with the drug in different
paediatric age groups. The data support the hypothesis
