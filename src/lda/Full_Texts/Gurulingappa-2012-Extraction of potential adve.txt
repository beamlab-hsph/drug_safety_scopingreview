Abstract
The sheer amount of information about potential adverse drug events published in
medical case reports pose major challenges for drug safety experts to perform timely
monitoring. Efficient strategies for identification and extraction of information about
potential adverse drug events from free-text resources are needed to support
pharmacovigilance research and pharmaceutical decision making. Therefore, this work
focusses on the adaptation of a machine learning-based system for the identification
and extraction of potential adverse drug event relations from MEDLINE case reports. It
relies on a high quality corpus that was manually annotated using an ontology-driven
methodology. Qualitative evaluation of the system showed robust results. An
experiment with large scale relation extraction from MEDLINE delivered underidentified potential adverse drug events not reported in drug monographs. Overall, this
approach provides a scalable auto-assistance platform for drug safety professionals to
automatically collect potential adverse drug events communicated as free-text data.

Background
Adverse drug effects are a very serious issue that confronts patients, healthcare providers,
regulatory authorities and drug manufacturers. While stringent measures for detecting
risks associated with drug usage are clinical trials, the wide field usage might show additional risks non detectable in the clinical trials due to the limited number of patients
involved. After the marketing approval, undesired effect of drugs are reported to the
authorities using so called Spontaneous Adverse Event Reporting Systems, that are then
timely analyzed to ensure safe use of drugs [1]. A well known problem of pharmacovigilance is however the under reporting, namely the low number of reports that the
Authorities receive. Case reports published in the scientific biomedical literature represent an important resource complementary to the SAERS due to their abundant existence,
rapid rate of generation, and valuable information enclosed [2]. Due to their unstructured
nature, manual analysis of the scientific literature is challenging, cumbersome, and labor
intensive. In recent years, development of automatic natural language processing (NLP)
and information extraction (IE) techniques have gained large popularity. They include
identification of biomedical named entities, relations between the entities, or events
associated with them. Noticeable efforts have been invested on mining the potential
adverse drug events in different forms of free-text data. Examples include Wang et. al. [3]
who applied the MedLEE system on discharge summaries to identify medication events
and entities that could be potential adverse drug effects; these were detected using the

strength of statistical association based on their co-occurrences. Leaman et. al. [4] proposed a lenient NLP model for extracting adverse effects of drugs from social media such
as blogs. Gurulingappa et. al. [5] developed a machine learning-based system for classifying the sentences in MEDLINE case reports that assert potential adverse drug events.
However, according to the author’s knowledge, there is a limited focus on identification
of semantic relationships between drugs and adverse events in text. This is partly due
to the unavailability of suitable open access corpora that could be used for technology
development and benchmarking. Extracting relations between drugs and adverse effects
can facilitate appropriate indexing, precise searching, visualization, faster information
tracing and improve sensitivity of signal detection in pharmacovigilance. The use of ontology of adverse drug events for automated signal generation in pharmacovigilance has
already been proposed [6] and its application to information retrieval has been exploited
by the same group few years later in the VIGITERMES project [7]. There, the OntoEIM
adverse event ontology was used to extend the dictionary of adverse event entities, normalize queries, and consolidate annotations, achieving 29% precision and 67% recall on
MEDLINE abstracts. Automatic extraction of potential adverse drug events from clinical
records is an active area of research [8]. Mining social internet message boards to identify
potential adverse drug events has been reported [9], whereby in that work the extraction
of drug-event pairs was determined only using co-occurrence of terms within a window
of 20 tokens apart, and the use of machine learning systems was only focused on deidentification for privacy protection. This work reports on the adaptation of a machine
learning-based system for identifying the relations between drugs and adverse effects
in MEDLINE case reports; it relies on an ontology-driven manually annotated corpus
that strictly follows semantic annotation guidelines developed for clinical text [10]. The
system has been qualitatively evaluated and studied for its ability of support real time
pharmacovigilance studies.

Methods
Corpus preparation

The data set used for training and validation of the relation extraction system is the ADE
corpus [11]. The ADE corpus contains 2972 MEDLINE case reports that are manually
annotated in duplicate and harmonized by three annotators. The corpus contains annotations of 5063 drugs, 5776 conditions (e.g. diseases, signs, symptoms), and 6821 relations
between drugs and conditions representing clear adverse events. All annotations are confined to sentence level i.e. drugs and conditions representing adverse events co-occurring
only within individual sentences are annotated. Drugs and conditions that are not part of
a potential adverse event relation are not annotated. This was done in accordance to the
annotation guidelines. The ADE corpus contains annotations of relations between drugs
and conditions that represent True relations. This represents a sparsely annotated dataset.
For training a supervised classifier, it was essential to generate False relations i.e. drugs
and conditions that do not fall into adverse effect relations but that are still within the
same sentence. For this purpose, ProMiner, a dictionary-based named entity recognition
system [12] was employed. ProMiner was incorporated with DrugBank [13] and MedDRA
[14] dictionaries for the identification of drugs and conditions respectively in the ADE
corpus that were previously not annotated by human annotators. As a result of named
entity recognition, new instances encompassing 2269 drugs and 3437 conditions were

automatically annotated. Drug-condition pairs co-occurring within sentences that were
previously not annotated by humans formed False relations. Altogether, 5968 False relations were automatically generated. The corpus enriched with machine annotated drugs,
conditions, and relations between them is referred as ADE-EXT (indicating extended
ADE corpus). Figure 1 shows an illustration of True and False relations between drug and
conditions co-occurring within a sentence.
In the ADE-EXT corpus, 120 manually annotated True relations were not suitable for
the NLP task. Examples include overlapping inter-related entities such as acute lithium
toxicity where lithium is related to acute toxicity. After removal of nested annotations, the
ADE-EXT corpus was decomposed into a training set (ADE-EXT-TRAIN) and a test set
(ADE-EXT-TEST). Counts of entities and relations in subsets of ADE-EXT corpora are
shown in Table 1.
Relation extraction workflow

For the identification and extraction of drug-condition entity pairs that constitute a
potential adverse event relation, the Java Simple Relation Extraction (JSRE) system [15]
was employed. JSRE provides a re-trainable and scalable supervised classification platform that uses Support Vector Machines (SVMs) [16] with different kernels specially
designed for the NLP and relation extraction. All sentences in ADE-EXT-TRAIN and
ADE-EXT-TEST containing drug-condition pairs labelled as either True or False were
transformed into the SRE format before subjecting them to relation extraction. The SRE
format is a unique way of representing data within the JSRE platform where tokens
appearing in sentences are enriched with their parts-of-speech tags, lemmas, and flags
indicating if a token is a part of named entity or not. Amongst different kernels available,
the shallow linguistic kernel was thoroughly used since it has been widely applied and has
shown success during similar relation extraction tasks [17]. The ADE-EXT-TRAIN was
used as data for training and cross-validation of JSRE whereas the ADE-EXT-TEST was
used as an independent test set.
Mapping annotation ontology against ontology of adverse events

The Clinical E-Science Framework (CLEF) initiative [18] investigated how to generate semantically annotated medical corpora for information extraction. As described by
Gurulingappa et. al. [11], we adopted the standard established by the CLEF framework for
the annotation workflow [10] however we reshaped the annotation schema by using only
two of the original entities (condition, drug) and extended it with a third one (dosage).
None of the relationships used by the CLEF annotation schema could be reused for our
work, since the CLEF annotation schema did not consider adverse drug events, instead we
created two relations: drug-cause-condition, drug-has-dosage. In this work we focused

only on automating the detection of drug-cause-condition thus dosage will not be mentioned further. The ADE corpus has been created using the Knowtator plugin for Protégé
[19], an ontology-driven corpus annotation tool also used for the creation of the CLEF
corpus. Although we adopted the same tool used in CLEF and also adopted the standard
established by the CLEF framework for the annotation workflow, we could not adopt the
same annotation ontology since the latter was not able to capture drug-adverse event and
drug-dosage relations. The annotation ontology described above was therefore used to
create the ADE corpus. Subsequent to the corpus creation, the realism-based biomedical ontology for representation of adverse events (OAE) has been published [20]. OAE
has been developed following the principles of Ontological Realism, thus is aligned with
the Basic Formal Ontology and the Relation Ontology, and with the Open Biological and
Biomedical Ontologies (OBO) Foundry principles of openness, collaboration and use of
a common shared syntax. OAE has 484 representational units, annotated by means of
369 terms with specific identifiers and 115 terms imported from existing ontologies. The
use of ontologies has proven of great value in biomedicine, also since it enable machine
reasoning, abstraction and automatic hypothesis generation. We therefore had interest in
investigating if the knowledge encoded in the annotations of the ADE corpus could be
semantically connected to the OAE. For doing this, we manually compared the definitions
of the entities of OAE and of ADE annotation ontology. Figure 2 shows the basic design
patterns of OAE, ADE and CLEF as from the original papers, emphasizing shared entities
using green and red colors.

Results and discussion
Performance evaluation criteria

The performance of relation extraction was evaluated by 10-fold cross-validation of
the training data. During cross-validation of the training data and final evaluation over
the test set, classification performances were assessed using the F-score over Truelabelled relations since they represent potential adverse event relations between drugs
and conditions that denote a focused relation class being studied.
Assessment of relation extraction

Baseline experiments began with training and cross-validation of JSRE over the ADEEXT-TRAIN corpus. Results of system’s performances are shown in Table 2. The system
achieved an overall F-score of 0.87 after cross-validation. Upon the final test over
ADE-EXT-TEST, the system attained F-score of 0.87 indicating a consistency in classification. A subset of instances misclassified during the cross-validation and testing were
manually investigated to understand the common sources of errors. Limited context

appeared to be one reason for misclassification. For example, the title Niacin maculopathy
(PMID:3174043) infers maculopathy as a potential adverse event of niacin that lacks contextual description to support machine classification. Distantly co-occurring inter-related
entities constituted couple of errors. For example, in the sentence CASE SUMMARY:
A 65-year-old patient chronically treated with the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor
(SSRI) citalopram developed confusion, agitation, tachycardia, tremors, myoclonic jerks
and unsteady gait, consistent with serotonin syndrome, following initiation of fentanyl, and
all symptoms and signs resolved following discontinuation of fentanyl (PMID:17381671);
the relation between confusion and the last appearing drug name fentanyl was incorrectly
classified. Case reports often contain frequencies at which potential adverse events were
observed. For instance, The toxic effects of methotrexate included elevated liver transaminases (3/4), nausea (2/4), abdominal pain (2/4), bone pain (2/4), mild neutropenia (1/4),
and mild pruritus (1/4) (PMID:433855); this sentence shows examples of relations where
the system had difficulties in identification of correct relations. Potential adverse drug
events are categorized according to their severity: serious suspected adverse drug reactions require immediate action by medical professionals. Manual investigation of the
predicted results showed that the system was able to capture most of the serious potential adverse events. These findings demonstrate the potential of this approach to facilitate

the identification of potential signals from case reports, of great interest for drug safety
experts.
Impact of size of the training set on the performance

In order to study the impact of size of the training data on performance of classification, the ADE-EXT-TRAIN was decomposed into random subsets containing 10, 20,
50, 100, 200, 500, 1000, and 2000 documents. The JSRE was trained over these subsets
independently in different rounds and evaluated by 10-fold cross-validation. Table 3
shows that already using 200 documents one could achieve performances over the 80%
range. Whereby, to obtain a classifier with a standard deviation of 1%, one needs a
substantially large training data.
Mapping the ADE annotation ontology to the ontology of adverse events

As clearly shown in Figure 2, both the ADE annotation ontology and OAE represent
adverse drug reactions using formal ontological methods. In spite of this common goal,
the two ontologies use different naming for the two core entities: a Condition in the
ADE annotation ontology coincide with a drug adverse event in OAE; a Drug in the ADE
annotation ontology coincide with a drug-administration in OAE. The ADE ontology
additionally introduce the entity dosage, not specified in OAE at the time of its development since OAE originally focused on vaccines for which dosing is not an essential
medical concept. Both ADE and OAE model a causal relationship between Condition or
Adverse event and Drug or Medical intervention, with the latter being the causal source.
The only entity shared by the CLEF annotation ontology with OAE and ADE is the
Drug-or-device, that coincide with a Drug or Medical intervention.

Use case study: large scale relation extraction
An experiment was conducted in order to understand the real-world use case scenarios for the extraction of potential adverse drug events from text. This was performed
by applying the trained extraction tool to the whole MEDLINE and thereafter comparing them to the information present in drug leaflets present in the SIDER [21]
database. Some of the automatically extracted potential adverse drug events, not present

in SIDER, were manually investigated for their validity by comparison to the Medicines
and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) drug label changes reported in
2009.
Relation extraction from MEDLINE

MEDLINE articles published before 2009 were gathered to form a Medline-2009 corpus. ProMiner was equipped with DrugBank and MedDRA dictionaries for tagging drugs
and conditions occurring in sentences of Medline-2009. A JSRE model trained over the
ADE-TRAIN-EXT corpus was applied for classification of relations between drugs and
conditions as True or False where a True relation indicates potential drug-related adverse
event. As a result of relation extraction, 165680 relations were extracted between 1611
drugs and 5079 adverse effects where drugs and adverse effects were normalized to
DrugBank and MedDRA respectively.
Adverse effect extraction from SIDER

Side Effect Resource (SIDER) is a database of adverse drug effects that links 888 drugs
to 1450 adverse effects. It has been constructed manually from the summary of product
leaflets of each drug. Drugs and their adverse effects were extracted from SIDER version
1.01 that contains drug leaflets published before 2009.
MHRA drug label changes

In 2009, the MHRA proposed safety label updates for 26 drugs. These were of course
not all the safety label updates that the MHRA identified in 2009, but those that MHRA
decided to give particular visibility through their web site. These new adverse drug effects
were manually extracted and they serve as a standard reference for validation of potential
adverse drug events automatically extracted from Medline-2009 using the JSRE trained
method.
Validation of large scale relation extraction

From the MHRA label change dataset, three drugs were arbitrarily chosen for deeper
investigation. They are Rituximab, Efalizumab, and Natalizumab: three anti-neoplastic
and immunomodulatory monoclonal antibodies. For the three drugs of interest, potential
adverse drug events were selected from the Medline-2009 predictions and SIDER. Potential adverse drug events extracted from Medline-2009 that are not reported in SIDER were
manually checked against the label changes of MHRA.
Manual investigation of machine predicted potential adverse events showed that the
system was able to capture valid potential adverse events from free-text that were not
yet reported in product leaflets (Table 4). These adverse effects were later updated on
drug labels by the UK regulatory authorities. This instance provides a good example for

how the developed framework can help in capturing potential adverse drug events from
literature and therefore support pharmacovigilance.

Conclusions
This work reports on the adaptation of a machine learning-based JSRE system for the
identification and extraction of potential adverse events of drugs in scientific case reports.
A methodology has been discussed to enrich a sparsely annotated corpus and its subsequent use to build classification models. Evaluation of the system’s performance showed
promising results. A use-case study performed on relation extraction from large scale literature showed the system’s ability to capture valid, under-reported, and novel potential
adverse events not yet present in product leaflets.
The performance of the system can be improved in several ways. In the current experiments, only the default features acceptable by JSRE were used. Optimization of feature
representation to include additional features for instance from syntactic sentence parse
trees may further improve the results. Development of additional strategies like postprocessing to classify relations with missing contextual descriptions can help to recover
more relations. Furthermore, extension of handling inter-sentence relations needs to be
considered in order to further increase coverage.
The reported experimental results denote the research status on identification from
text of potential adverse drug events. There are several strategies that are being followed.
The authors plan to benchmark the performances of several named entity taggers against
the ADE corpus for the identification of drugs and conditions mentions in text. The
current experiments have been performed on the ADE corpus, since that was the only
one available when this work was done, however while writing this report a new corpus has been published, namely the EU-ADR corpus [22]. It will be interesting to see if
the performance of JSRE on the ADE corpus will be different compared to the EU-ADR
corpus.
Similarly, benchmarking results of public and commercial relation extraction systems
will be performed [23] and the practical impact of the information extracted from text on
predicting drug label changes will be studied in detail.
The use of ontologies for driving information extraction has been reported [24,25]. We
plan to explore the use of various available tools (e.g. ODIE, OBCIE,semantixs) using the
OAE ontology and compare the performance of the ontology driven / based methods for
information extraction against the method presented here.
The current work has demonstrated promising results, it has the potential to reduce the
manual reading time, improve the quality of the signal detection process, and therefore
positively contribute to safer use of drugs to the benefit of patients and society. We speculate that this work could also pave the road to pharmacovigilance applications on social
media and multimedia sources too.
