The main objective of this study is to conduct a disproportionality analysis of adverse events in the Japan Adverse
Event Report (JADER) database and evaluate the risk of the DPP-4 inhibitor induced autoimmune disorder, the
secondary objective is risk assessment of sex difference and age difference. The proportional reporting ratio (PRR)
of frequency-based statistics and Bayesian estimates of the information components (IC) were calculated as a
measure of signal detection. Sex difference and age difference were evaluated using signal score calculated from
the PRR and the Chi-square. In patients taking DPP-4 inhibitors, 94 reports of autoimmune disorders were detected
with both signals; PRR: 4.09, chi-square: 158.26 and IC: 1.66, 95 % confidence interval: 1.32–2.00). For other
antidiabetic drugs, no signals were detected. The signal of males was PRR: 4.53, chi-square: 110.91 and signal
score: 6.22, the signal of female was PRR: 3.53, chi-square: 47.65 and signal score: 5.12. About age difference, the
signal scores were 6.71 for patients over 60 years and 0.56 for patients under 60 years old. This study suggests
that the DPP-4 inhibitors, unlike other antidiabetic drugs, were associated with autoimmune disorders. Signals of
the DPP-4 inhibitors induced autoimmune disorders were detected in both male and female, but no sex difference
was observed, but age difference was observed. Especially attention should be paid to patients over 60 years old.

1. Introduction
Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors competitively inhibit
DPP-4, which reduces blood glucose by increasing the secretion
of incretin from gastrointestinal epithelial cells when food is
ingested. Because incretin induced insulin secretion is dependent
on glucose concentration, the DPP-4 inhibitors are less likely to
cause hypoglycemia or weight gain compared to conventional
insulin secretagogues such as sulfonylurea and glinide drugs. Thus,
the DPP-4 inhibitors have become important for the treatment of
type 2 diabetes, a disease that reduces insulin secretion.
However, DPP-4 is the same substance as cluster of differentiation 26
(CD26), a cell membrane surface antigen presents throughout the body
that is also expressed in T cells (Reinhold et al. 2007; Alexandraki et
al. 2006). For that reason, the DPP-4 inhibitors may affect the immune
system. In fact, epidemiological reports have shown that the risk of
developing infections is higher for patients taking the DPP-4 inhibitors
than for those taking other antidiabetic drugs (Willemen et al. 2011).
The inhibition of CD26 activation by DPP-4 inhibitor administration appears to lead to immune suppression and not to immune
activation followed by autoimmune disorders. However, a case
autoimmune disorder, DPP-4 inhibitor induced bullous pemphigoid was reported (Mendonça et al. 2016).

Bullous pemphigoid occurs frequently among the elderly. The
number of patients with bullous pemphigoid increases yearly as
society ages, as does the number of cases of DPP-4 induced bullous
pemphigoid (Hattori et al. 2013; Skandalis et al. 2012; Pasmatziet
et al. 2011; Aouidad et al. 2013). Autoantibodies cause antigen-antibody reactions with basement membrane hemidesmosomal
pemphigus antigens; bullous pemphigoid (BP) 180 and BP 230 in
bullous pemphigoid, the most common form of autoimmune bullous
pemphigoid (Hattori et al.. 2013). Death from bullous pemphigoid is
not uncommon. A recent report found that the yearly death rate for
bullous pemphigoid in the elderly is as high as 39.1 % (Nishie 2016).
Numerous studies have used disproportionality analyses for
assessing the safety of drugs after marketing (Kose et al. 2017;
Ohyama et al. 2017; Noguchi et al. 2018a, b). These “safety
signals” include the proportional reporting ratio (PRR) (Evans
et al. 2001) and the reporting odds ratio (ROR) (van Puijenbroek
et al. 2002) similar to classical statistical methods, in addition
to Bayesian estimates of the information component (IC) (Bate
et al. 1998) and the empirical Bayes geometric mean (EBGM)
(Szarfman et al. 2002), which are used to calculate parameters of
prior distribution.
In addition to these detection methods, there is also a method using
association rule mining (Noguchi et al. 2018c, d) and signal score
(Noguchi et al. 2018a, b; Shirakuni et al. 2009).
Among the safety signals, the PRR and the ROR are easy to calculate; but when the number of reports is small, the signal values
are unstable. In contrast, while it takes time to calculate the signal
values using the IC and the EBGM, those signal values are relatively stable even when there are few reports (Fujita 2009).
In this study, we used the Japanese Adverse Drug Event Report
database (JADER) published by the Pharmaceuticals and Medical
Devices Agency (PMDA) to analyze signal detection in order to
clarify the relationship between the DPP-4 inhibitors (and the antidiabetic drug) and autoimmune disorder.

2. Investigations and results
We analyzed gender, age, deficiency of the original disease, and age
uncertainty such as “youth” and “elderly” using data from JADER (1st
quarter of 2004 to the 4th quarter of 2015), excluding reports that did not
include the primary disease. In this study, signals were calculated only
for diabetic patients. Therefore, the total number of cases that could be
used for analysis was 38,887. The suspected drugs targeted for the analysis were 8 classes of antidiabetic drugs, a total of 34 drugs (Table 1).
Targeted adverse events (AEs) were tabulated with the preferred
terms (PTs), including the high level group term (HLGT) “autoimmune disorder.” Signal detection was carried out in accordance
with the general detection criteria from previous reports in which
the number of reports (n11) exceeded 3, the PRR exceeded 2, and the
chi-square exceeded 4 (Evans et al. 2001) and the lower limit of the
IC 95 % confidence interval (CI) exceeded 0 (Szarfman et al. 2002).
Sex difference and age difference were evaluated using signal score.
Signal scores to be compared were calculated from the PRR and the
chi-square of male and female or elderly and non-elderly patients,
respectively, using the formula (1) proposed by Shirakuni et al.
(2009). The detection criteria of the signal score is shown in Eq.
(2) using 2 groups of patients belonging to group A and patients
belonging to group B as an example (Noguchi et al. 2018a, b).

information components, CI: confidence interval.

3. Discussion
In this study, we focused on the possibility that DPP-4 inhibitors
affect immunomodulatory function. Disproportionality analysis of
data from JADER was used to compare the association between
immunomodulatory function of the DPP-4 inhibitors to that of
other antidiabetic drugs. Furthermore, sex differences and age
differences were investigated for the association of onset of autoimmune disorders in patients receiving DPP4 inhibitors.
Statistical studies have shown that using disproportionality analysis to calculate the PRR or the ROR is easy, but the signals are
unstable when there are only few reports (Fujita 2009).
Since the signal of each DPP-4 inhibitor was also calculated, the
number of reports that can be used for signal calculation is small.
Therefore, we used not only PRR but also IC that can detect a
stable signal even when the number of reports is small, so we could
evaluate the association between the DPP-4 inhibitors and autoimmune diseases. Nevertheless, many confounding factors can
affect autoimmunity and the analysis of our results. For instance,
among antidiabetic drugs, the signal for “autoimmune diseases”
was detected only in DPP-4 inhibitors; but while both the PRR and
the IC signals were detected in four of the DPP-4 inhibitors.
No signals were detected for trelagliptin, which may have behaved
differently from other formulations of the DPP-4 inhibitors
because it is a weekly formulation. Two AEs were reported for
omarigliptin, another weekly formulation released in Japan in
September 2015, but neither of them was related to autoimmune
diseases. Thus, further analysis of weekly formulations is necessary once enough case reports have accumulated.

ORIGINAL ARTICLES
While no sex differences were seen, influence of age was obvious.
In the survey of each age group, both the PRR and the IC signals
were detected in the age group from 60 to 89 years. So the signal
score of over 60 years old patients was 10 times higher than that of
patients under 60 years old. Based on this study, patients who are
at least over 60 years old and receiving DPP4 inhibitor treatment
should be monitored for autoimmune diseases.
Autoimmune disorders caused by the DPP-4 inhibitors include
pemphigoid, rheumatoid arthritis, immunologic thrombocytopenic
purpura, autoimmune pancreatitis, and Polymyalgia rheumatica.
Another consideration is that DPP-4 is the same substance as the
cell surface antigen CD26 present throughout the body. Among the
CD26-positive T cells cytokine-secreting cells exist, such as type
1 T helper (Th1) lymphocytes that produce interleukin-2 (IL-2)
and interferon gamma (INF-g) and are believed to be involved in
immune function regulation (e.g., induction of B cell immunoglobulin production) (Hattori et al. 2013).
In addition, blood DPP-4 concentrations are reportedly lower in
patients and mice with rheumatoid arthritis than in those without
rheumatoid arthritis. Low blood DPP-4 concentrations in laboratory animals can raise the activity of C-X-C chemokine receptor
4 (CXCR4) and its ligand stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1)
(Busso et al. 2005).
Epidemiological studies (Willemen et al. 2011) have shown that
DPP-4 inhibitors increase the risk of infection compared to other
antidiabetic drugs, and there are case reports of possible DPP-4
inhibitor drug-induced fever (Anno et al. 2013, Matsubara et al.
2017).
On the other hand, there are not only reports of DPP-4 inhibitors
induced autoimmune disorders from the the spontaneous reporting
system, but also several case reports, for example, DPP-4 inhibitor
induced bullous pemphigoid (Mendonça et al. 2016; Yoshiji et al.
2018) and rheumatoid arthritis (Yokota and Igaki 2012).
Furthermore, we must also consider that in addition to inhibiting
DPP-4, the DPP-4 inhibitors have a mild inhibitory effect against
other DPP-4 related enzymes such as DPP-8 and DPP-9 (Kirby et
al. 2013). Unlike DPP-4, DPP-8 and DPP-9 are present in the cytoplasm of cells such as lymphocytes. DPP-8/9-selective inhibitors
reportedly potentiate T cell activity in vitro (Lankas et al. 2005).
Vildagliptin has lower DPP-4 selectivity and a relatively stronger
DPP-8/9 inhibitory effect than sitagliptin (Lee et al. 2008). In this
study, the magnitude of the DPP-4 inhibitor signals for autoimmune
disease did not correlate with the strength of DPP-8/9 inhibitory
effects. However, the magnitude of the signal does not necessarily
correlate with the strength of pharmacological action (Noguchi et
al. 2018b). There are reports that large doses of vildagliptin (high
enough to inhibit DPP-8/9) are not toxic to mice (Burkey et al.
2008). Therefore, further studies are needed to investigate the
influence of DPP-4 inhibitors on DPP-8/9.
Finally, because the medical database used in this study is based
on spontaneous reporting, only some of the AEs experienced in
clinical settings had been registered. Careful interpretation of
detected signals is necessary to mitigate reporting biases such as
the notoriety effect (the number of reported AEs increases when
the public associates a drug with an AE) and the ripple effect
(the number of reported AEs for one drug increases because of
the notoriety of another drug in the same class) (Pariente et al.
2007).
This study suggests that DPP-4 inhibitors induce autoimmune
disorders. However, the number of reports currently registered in
JADER is limited and needs more detailed analysis. The authors
recommend further clinical research using real world data, and a
detailed meta-analysis with more stringent clinical and scientific
analyses be conducted.

4.1. Data source
Authors do not own the data because the Japanese authority, PMDA, does not does not
permit sharing the Japanese Adverse Drug Event Report database (JADER) directly.
Data owned by PMDA can be accessed directly here:

4.2. Identification of the suspected drugs and definition of autoimmune
disease
The AEs registered in JADER were the PTs used in the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities/ Japanese version (MedDRA/J). In this study, the targeted AEs were
tabulated with all PTs including the HLGT “autoimmune disorder”. Analysis was
carried out by linking with all PTs registered in HLGT. (In diabetic patients, 15 PT
shown in Table 6 were registered in HLGT.)
In this study, the patients with autoimmune disorder as the primary disease were
not excluded in advance. In JADER, the cases registered are the AEs caused by the
suspected drugs. Therefore, we considered that the deterioration of the patient’s
primary disease is also an AE in this study.

4.3. Disproportionality analysis
The number of reported AEs due to the use of the targeted drug was not based on the
number of drug-AEs pair. Rather, the number of reports of adverse events due to the
use of the target drugs was counted based on the number of cases.
Signal detection was carried out in accordance with the general detection criteria from
previous reports in which the number of reports (n11) exceeded 3, the PRR exceeded 2,
and the chi-square exceeded 4 (Evans et al. 2001) and the lower limit of the IC 95 %
CI exceeded 0 (Szarfman et al. 2002).

4.4. Comparison of the signal scores
Sex and age differences were evaluated using the signal score. The signal scores to be
compared were calculated from the PRR and the chi-square of male and female, or
elderly and non-elderly patients, respectively, using formula (1) proposed by Shirakuni et al. (2009):
The signal score = ln (PRR) + ln (chi-square) …(1)
The detection criteria of the signal score is shown in Eq. (2) using two groups of
patients belonging to group A and patients belonging to group B as an example
(Noguchi et al. 2018a, b):
The signal score of group A > 2×(the signal score of group B) …(2)
