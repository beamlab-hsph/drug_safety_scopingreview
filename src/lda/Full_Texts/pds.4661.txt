720 Bimax algorithm parameters (minimal number of columns and rows was 3, 4, or

Results:

The optimal strength of the IC threshold was 0.80, and the minimum num-

be used.8-10 Harpaz et al applied the binary inclusion‐maximal
biclustering (Bimax) algorithm on the US Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) Adverse Event Reporting System database.6,11 They
found that this analysis could provide valuable insight into the etiology
of ADRs and assist in the identification of novel or rare ADRs.6
Because there are some differences between China's SRS and FDA's
Adverse Event Reporting System, the applicability and validity of
biclustering analysis in Chinese ADR data remain to be verified. For
example, there are more antibiotics and traditional Chinese medicines
in our database12 than in the FDA's. Additionally, we detect signals by
using proportional reporting ratio and IC, whereas the FDA used
gamma poisson shrinker.6,13 Moreover, most biclustering algorithms,
such as Bimax, require several specific parameters, including the minimal numbers of columns and rows and the strength of IC threshold in
the cluster,6 which also need to be further explored in China's SRS.
This study aimed to propose the Bimax algorithm for the
pharmacovigilance data mining of the SRS database of China and to
find the optimal parameters for the biclustering analysis. Finally, we
hoped to improve the efficiency of signal evaluation by identifying
similar signal groups.

Biclustering analysis using Bimax algorithm

Bimax is one of the several basic biclustering algorithms. It is developed for the analysis of binary data, with each cell containing either
a 1 or 0. Bimax is designed to find the inclusion‐maximal submatrices
(biclusters) of the data matrix in which all elements have a value equal
to 1. Bimax is able to find the largest clusters in an ADR data, which is
made of a subset of drugs that are all strongly associated with the
same subset of AEs.6,11,16,17 Therefore, this analysis required the
strength of the IC association to be dichotomized into “strong association” or “weak association,” respectively, with the “association
strength threshold.” Additionally, Bimax requires the user to prespecify 2 parameters, namely, the minimum numbers of columns (drugs)
and rows (AEs) needed to define a minimum bicluster.
In this study, we set the IC strength threshold at 0.05–4.00 with
an interval of 0.05, generating a total of 80 numerical values. We used
the various thresholds to dichotomize the strong association and weak
association. We also selected 3 different minimal numbers of columns
and rows, namely, 3, 4, and 5, as the Bimax parameters. Finally, we
conducted a biclustering analysis of the SRS data using a total of
720 different parameter settings. The biclustering results of the differ-

3.2.1

In this study, we applied 2 indicators in the calculation of RSR.
The first one was the average coincidence ratio (ACR). We
obtained the number of signals (n1) and the number of confirmed
ADRs (true signals according to the gold standard) (n2) in a bicluster
under a certain parameter setting using Bimax. The coincidence ratio
of the bicluster was equal to n2 divided by n1, and then we could
obtain the ACR of the total biclusters.
The second one was the involving ratio (IR). We obtained the
number of all signals (nb) in the total biclusters and the number of
strong associated ADRs (nt) under certain IC strength threshold. The
IR value was equal to nb divided by nt.

Change of number of biclusters

By using Bimax with various IC thresholds (IC = 0.05–4.00) and various minimal numbers of columns and rows (3, 4, or 5), biclusters were
identified by a total of 627 parameter settings. The number of
biclusters decreased rapidly when the IC thresholds increased constantly, while the minimal number of columns and rows remained
unchanged (Figure 2).

antipyretic‐analgesic and anti‐inflammatory drugs, such as aceclofenac,
meloxicam, celecoxib, and diclofenac, had the same mechanism of
action, which is the inhibition of cyclooxygenase needed in the synthesis of prostaglandins. Moreover, meloxicam‐face edema was
