boosted agents using data
mining in the FDA Adverse Event
Reporting System database

This current investigation was aimed to generate signals for adverse events (AEs) of darunavircontaining agents by data mining using the US Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event
Reporting System (FAERS). All AE reports for darunavir, darunavir/ritonavir, or darunavir/cobicistat
between July 2006 and December 2019 were identified. The reporting Odds Ratio (ROR), proportional
reporting ratio (PRR), and Bayesian confidence propagation neural network (BCPNN) were used to
detect the risk signals. A suspicious signal was generated only if the results of the three algorithms
were all positive. A total of 10,756 reports were identified commonly observed in hepatobiliary,
endocrine, cardiovascular, musculoskeletal, gastrointestinal, metabolic, and nutrition system. 40
suspicious signals were generated, and therein 20 signals were not included in the label. Severe
high signals (i.e. progressive extraocular muscle paralysis, acute pancreatitis, exfoliative dermatitis,
acquired lipodystrophy and mitochondrial toxicity) were identified. In pregnant women, umbilical cord
abnormality, fetal growth restriction, low birth weight, stillbirth, premature rupture of membranes,
premature birth and spontaneous abortion showed positive signals. Darunavir and its boosted agents
induced AEs in various organs/tissues, and were shown to be possibly associated with multiple adverse
pregnant conditions. This study highlighted some novel and severe AEs of darunavir which need to be
monitored prospectively.
The burden of morbidity and mortality associated with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection has
become a serious public health problem ­globally1. WHO and most national guidelines recommended all people
living with HIV to start antiretroviral therapy (ART) irrespective of clinical or immune s­ tatus1,2. Earlier initiation of ART has led to an overall improvement in disease control, and the annual number of people dying from
HIV-related causes has declined by 60% since the peak in 2­ 0043. However, the increasing use of antiretroviral
agents has raised potential safety concerns of these drugs which need to be systemically analyzed.
Darunavir, a nonpeptidic inhibitor of the HIV-1 protease with potent activity against resistant virus, was
initially approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2006 for the treatment of antiretroviralexperienced adults, and later for naive adults. It must be co-administered with a boosting agent, either ritonavir
or cobicistat. In 2008, FDA required labeling change of darunavir, warning the safety issues. In recent years,
multiple studies reported the adverse events (AEs) of darunavir-containing agents related to ­hepatic4 and skin
­system5. In addition, darunavir was considered a preferred protease inhibitor (PI) for pregnant females living
with HIV by the Health and Human Service (HHS) panel, its safety information during pregnancy was still under
ongoing ­monitoring6. In 2015, the antiretroviral pregnancy registry steering committee suggested that prenatal
exposure to PIs can lead to increased risk of miscarriage and low birth w
­ eight7. Nevertheless, clinical data on
pregnancy outcomes and fetal safety after darunavir exposure during pregnancy are limited.

Table 1.  Characteristics of adverse event reports submitted for darunavir and its boosted agents. a Serious
adverse events.

The primary aim of this pharmacovigilance study was to characterize the safety profile of darunavir-containing agents relating to various organ systems, moreover, evaluate the perinatal outcomes in HIV mothers
exposed to darunavir during pregnancy using data-mining of FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS).

Results

Descriptive analysis. During the study period, a total of 11,170,959 reports were submitted to FAERS, of
which 10,756 reports and 27,234 AEs for darunavir and its boosted agents, making each report contributing 2.53
AEs in average. Table 1 described the characteristics of AE reports submitted for darunavir. Higher rate of male
patients (n = 5898, 54.47%) was reported than female patients (n = 3111, 28.92%); 49.31% of the AEs occurred in
people aged 18–60 years; serious adverse events (SAEs) accounted for a relatively high proportion (41.47%), with
hospitalization and prolonged hospitalization being the most reported outcome (32.57%).
Signals of SDR and BCPNN. When AEs were classified with System Organ Class (SOC) of Medical Dic-

tionary of Regulatory Activities (MedDRA), the positive signals detected by the three algorithms were consistent, involving 11 organ systems: liver, kidney, metabolic and nutritional system, endocrine system, eye, cardiac
system, musculoskeletal system, nervous system, skin, gastrointestinal tract, and perinatal periods (Table 2).
Disproportionate reporting (SDR) and Bayesian confidence propagation neural network (BCPNN) of the standardized MedDRA queries (SMQs) analysis were summarized in Table 3. 13 SMQs emerged with statistical significancy.
Further analyses conducted at the PT level revealed 40 suspicious signals, 20 of which were not included in
the label. Among them, 6 suspicious signals were generated in hepatobiliary system, including hepatocyte injury,
hyperbilirubinemia, cholestasis, etc.; 6 signals in kidney and urinary system, including renal tubular necrosis,
decreased glomerular filtration rate, and proteinuria, ect; 3 in metabolism and nutrition system: hypertriglyceridaemia, hypercholesterolaemia and hypokalaemia; 1 in cardiovascular system: blood creatine phosphokinase
increased; 1 in musculoskeletal system: rhabdomyolysis; 4 in skin and subcutaneous tissue: rash generalized,
pruritus, dermatitis exfoliative, and Stevens-Johnson Syndrome; 4 in gastrointestinal system: diarrhea, gastrointestinal disorder, oesophageal candidiasis, and acute pancreatitis. It was worth noting that darunavir-containing
agents can induce progressive ophthalmoplegia, lipodystrophy acquired, mitochondrial toxicity, adrenal suppression and other severe high strength signals (Table 4).
Among pregnant women, umbilical cord abnormality, foetal growth restriction, low birth weight baby, stillbirth, premature rupture of membrane, premature baby and abortion spontaneous showed positive signals
(Table 5). When detected separately, signals of abortion spontaneous and foetal growth restriction for darunavir/
cobicistat were positive, and premature baby for darunavir/ritonavir positive (Table 6).

Discussion

As far as we know, this is the first comparative safety study on FAERS that aimed to assess the reported AEs of
darunavir and its boosted agents. Overall, three main findings emerged: (1) AEs related to darunavir exposure
involve various organs or tissues. We found statistically significant signals in the liver, kidney, metabolic and
nutritional system, endocrine system, eye, cardiac system, musculoskeletal system, nervous system, skin, and
gastrointestinal tract when classified with SOC, and 13 SMQs involving various systems emerged. (2) Strongly
positive signals related to mitochondrial toxicity (ROR = 171.92, PRR = 136.03, χ2 = 9713.13, IC-2SD = 5.42)
and eye disorders (included diplopia, eyelid ptosis, and progressive external ophthalmoplegia) were revealed
for the very first time. (3) Signals for adverse pregnancy outcomes were detected in our study, which highlights
its safety concern during pregnancy.
Studies indicated that some degree of serum aminotransferase elevations occurred in a high proportion of
patients with d
­ arunavir4,8 Our study uncovered positive signals for hepatocellular injury and elevation in serum
hepatic enzymes which were consistent with the previous findings. Apart from hepatocellular injury, we also
found darunavir can induce increased bilirubin, cholestasis, and jaundice which were not observed in clinical
studies. ­Yancheva9 reported a case of darunavir-related cholestatic hepatitis in an HIV patient in the third year of
his antiretroviral therapy. The toxic intermediates may be the cause of some liver injury. It is worth noting that,
except for hepatocellular injury, cholestasis should also be monitored when darunavir is prescribed.

In our study, 6 positive signals of the renal and urinary system were detected (AKI, renal impairment, blood
creatinine increased, glomerular filtration rate decreased, proteinuria, and renal tubular necrosis). It was showed
that cobicistat inhibits tubular secretion of creatinine without affecting actual glomerular ­function10. This should
be considered when interpreting changes in creatinine. Besides, our study uncovered an association of darunavir
with rhabdomyolysis, which might be one of the causes of kidney injury. On the other hand, we should take
caution explaining the significant signal of darunavir in renal injury, since HIV-associated nephropathy is one
of the complications in advanced HIV disease, the main manifestations of which were heavy proteinuria and a
decline in kidney f­ unction11. In accord with this assumption, drug resistance and treatment failure are significantly noted in the analysis, which implicated the occurrence of advanced HIV disease.
Our findings showed a disproportionate association with hypertriglyceridemia, hypercholesteremia, and
hypokalemia. It was consistent with the previous findings that exposure to certain PIs can cause an adverse change
in the lipid ­profile12. In a previous study, 15% of patients with boosted darunavir developed elevated triglyceride
levels compared with 7% percent in the comparator PI ­arms13. The signal of lipodystrophy, which has been associated with abnormalities in glucose and lipid metabolism, was extremely strong in our study. Lipodystrophy
can be manifested as lipoatrophy or fat accumulation, and 10–80% of HIV patients developed these c­ hanges14,15.
Data suggested that exposure to certain nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) is the major factor
of ­lipoatrophy15. Some studies showed that PIs may act synergistically with ­NRTIs16, and therapy with PIs alone
does not appear to lead to l­ipoatrophy17. Fat accumulation was initially thought to be lead by the use of P
­ Is18.
A study showed that body fat tissue increased in patients on darunavir/ritonavir monotherapy and darunavir/
ritonavir plus NRTIs, with no difference between the a­ rms19.
Hyperglycemia is another positive signal identified in our study. Animal experiments and clinical trials of
PIs have demonstrated insulin resistance with these ­agents20. One possible explanation is that PIs can direct

down-regulation of the glucose transporter-4, the major transporter of glucose into fat cells, and cardiac and
skeletal ­muscle21. Since HIV-positive persons are at increased risk for premature cardiovascular disease (CVD)22,
dyslipidemia and hyperglycemia caused by darunavir can adversely affect the risk factors for CVD. However, the
association between darunavir or atazanavir and increased risk of myocardial infarction or stroke has not been
established which was seen with other ­PIs23.
Hypokalemia is common in AIDS inpatients, usually due to AIDS-related gastrointestinal ­complications24.
Hypokalemia directly caused by darunavir has not been reported, but it was suggested that diarrhea and vomiting were the most common adverse reactions of ­darunavir25, which we presumed might to be the cause of
hypokalemia.
Adrenal suppression and dysfunction were found related to the use of darunavir-containing agents. The
possible explanation may be due to drug-drug interaction of pharmacokinetic boosters with exogenous
­glucocorticoids26. Glucocorticoids, including non-systemic preparations, were widely used in HIV patients for
non-AIDS-related ­conditions27. Iatrogenic Cushing’s syndrome can result from the co-administration of ritonavir
or cobicistat and synthetic glucocorticoids given by any r­ oute28,29. The effects of these boosters on cytochrome
P450 lead to prolongation of the half-life of the latter. The resultant high plasma levels of glucocorticoid cause
Cushing’s syndrome and secondary adrenal insufficiency.
Our study revealed an association of mitochondrial toxicity and darunavir that has not been reported previously. Mitochondrial toxicity has been recognized as a major adverse effect with ­NRTIs30, but not darunavir or
other PIs. The clinical expression of mitochondrial disorders is extremely variable, and organs and tissues highly
related to oxidative phosphorylate (muscles and neuro for instance) are mostly easily involved. Muscle symptoms
included exercise intolerance, fatigue, muscle weakness, elevated serum creatine kinase, myalgia, or less often,
­rhabdomyolysis31. It is not surprising to find that, increased creatine phosphokinase and rhabdomyolysis are both
positive signals. Mitochondrial toxicity might be a possible explanation for the cause of these AEs.
Other novel AEs inferred to be associated with mitochondrial toxicity were eye d
­ isorders32, which included
diplopia, eyelid ptosis, and progressive external ophthalmoplegia (PEO). Among them, the signal of PEO showed
a significantly high strength (ROR = 1761.17, PRR = 1753.15, IC = 3.54). PEO is a myopathic alteration of slow
progression which affects extrinsic ocular muscles; ptosis of the eyelid being the most characteristic sign. Some
cases progress to eye immobilization. PEO is one of the clinical phenotypes of mitochondrial ­myopathies33. We
speculated that darunavir induced eye disorders through mitochondrial toxicity, although the relationship has
to be confirmed with rigorous studies.
There is little doubt that mitochondrial toxicity is the major cause of NRTIs-induced myopathy and
­neuropathy34, and we can’t help but speculate the newly found AEs with nervous system disorders (neuropathy
and peripheral neuropathy) of darunavir in our study might also be related to mitochondrial toxicity. However,
this speculation needs to be further investigated.
We found generalized rash, pruritus, exfoliative dermatitis and Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS) were positive signals in the skin and subcutaneous tissue. In clinical trials, rash occurred in 16% of subjects, which
were generally mild-to-moderate35. Severe skin rash, including erythema multiforme and SJS has also been
­reported36. The discontinuation rate due to rash was 0.3%25. The incidence of SJS is 100-fold higher among
HIV ­individuals37. The reasons for the susceptibility are not fully understood, although exposure to multiple
medications may c­ ontribute38. Our study brought to the forefront again the risk of severe adverse skin reactions
caused by darunavir.
Our study identified diarrhea, gastrointestinal disorder, esophageal candidiasis, and acute pancreatitis as
positive signals in the gastrointestinal system. Diarrhea is one of the most commonly reported adverse reactions
for darunavir (10%)39. Esophageal candidiasis, which is typically seen in patients with HIV who have advanced
immunosuppression, may not be directly related to the administration of darunavir, but rather to the failure
of antiviral ­therapy40. Acute pancreatitis induced by darunavir-based ARTs has been reported ­previously41.
Hypertriglyceridemia and hypercholesteremia related to darunavir may play a role. Besides, it was suggested that
mitochondrial toxicity may be the cause of NRTI-induced ­pancreatitis42, the possibility cannot be ruled out that
acute pancreatitis is one of the manifestations of darunavir-induced mitochondrial toxicity.
PIs have been a key component of HIV therapy in pregnant women. In 2016, darunavir/ritonavir replaced
lopinavir/ritonavir as a recommended agent due to its potent antiretroviral activity and a lower rate of causing
lipid ­abnormality43. The fetal transfer rate of darunavir was 12–16%, and a mean concentration of 132 ± 32 ng/mL
was identified in the fetal c­ ompartment44. Such exposure may provide the benefit of pre-exposure prophylaxis,
but it could also lead to toxicity. Although teratogenicity has not been identified in animal ­studies25, no welldesigned controlled trials have been performed in humans. The antiviral pregnancy registry reported that the risk
of birth defects did not increase following darunavir e­ xposure45, and darunavir could even play a protective role
in the development of m
­ icrocephaly46. Our study showed positive signals for darunavir in terms of premature
baby, spontaneous abortion, foetal growth restriction, low birth weight baby, stillbirth, premature rupture of
membranes, and umbilical cord abnormality. In the previous studies, preterm birth and low birth weight were the
most commonly reported adverse events after pregnancy exposure to ­PIs47,48. One study suggested that prematurity was independently associated with ritonavir-boosted PI therapy during p
­ regnancy49. We further detected
signals for darunavir/ritonavir and darunavir/cobicistat respectively, identifying positive signal for darunavir/
ritonavir only in prematurity, and darunavir/cobicistat in abortion spontaneous and feotal growth restriction.
The result further verified that preterm birth may be more associated with ritonavir. Since the combination of
darunavir/cobicistat is not currently recommended during pregnancy due to a lack of safety data for ­cobicistat43,
the difference of these two combinations for the offspring need to be further studied.
Despite some steps were taken to make the results more reliable, the following limitations of our study need
to be noticed: (1) we derived ROR, PRR, and IC values based on the reported frequency of drug-event combinations, and were adjusted based on the rates reported by other drugs and the rates of all other AEs reported for

the studied drug. The value indicated an increased risk of AE reporting and not a risk of AE occurrence. (2) The
FAERS database is subject to various biases such as under-reporting, over-reporting, duplicates, unverified source
of submitted data, missing information, misspelling, etc. (3) Certainty that the drug is in fact responsible for the
reported event is absent. This is particularly true for antiretroviral agents since HIV infection per se can induce
a higher risk of multi-system complications and are generally treated with a combination of antiviral drugs. The
absence of previous exposure to other HIV treatments as well as the stage of disease progression makes it difficult to evaluate the influence of other antiviral drugs and the disease. (4) Except for pregnancy and perinatal
conditions, the signal mining was not carried out separately for darunavir, darunavir/ritonavir, and darunavir/
cobicistat, making it impossible to distinguish AEs resulted from darunavir and boosters.

Conclusions

The safety profile of darunavir containing agents was reviewed using the AEs submitted to the FAERS. Base on
the 10,756 reports, AEs with darunavir and its boosted agents took place in many organs/tissues. An association related to mitochondrial toxicity was identified and was presumed to be associated with the occurrence of
AEs in multiple systems (eye, muscle, nerve, etc.). Darunavir was shown to be possibly associated with multiple
adverse pregnancy conditions. The usefulness of pharmacovigilance research should be corroborated with the
real-world FAERS data; however, further clinical trials and real-world study are required to confirm our findings.

Methods

Data sources. The data for this study were retrieved from the public release of the FAERS database, which
adheres to the international safety reporting guidance issued by the International Conference on Harmonisation
(ICH E2B). AEs are coded using preferred terms (PTs) in the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) terminology. Currently, FAERS comprises more than 12 million reports gathered worldwide. These postmarketing reports contain relevant anonymised information relating to the AEs, include: (1) Demographic and
administrative information and the initial report image ID number; (2) Drug information from the case reports;
(3) Reaction information from the reports; (4) Patient outcome information from the reports, etc. We conducted
a retrospective pharmacovigilance study using data from the FAERS database covering the period from July 2006
to December 2019 through the OpenVigil FDA platform. To ensure data integrity, AE reports for “darunavir”,
“darunavir/ritonavir” or “darunavir/cobicistat” were analyzed. The reports were included only if the drug was
primary and secondary suspected. We removed duplicated records according to the FDA’s recommendations by
selecting the latest FDA_DT when the CASE_ID and FDA_DT were the same, and excluded reports with more
than three differences. We also excluded reports with more than 3 items of missing information.
Definition of AEs.

SDR and BCPNN were performed using all existent narrow SMQs and SOCs. Further
analysis on PT levels was conducted using the same method. Two researchers classified the AEs reports in terms
of SMQs, SOCs and PTs, and collected clinical characteristics of the patient, including gender, age, AE outcome,
and type of reporter, respectively. Death, life-threatening adverse drug experience, inpatient/prolonged hospitalization, and significant disability/incapacity were defined as SAEs.

Data mining algorithm and statistical analysis. Descriptive analyses were conducted to summarize
the clinical characteristics of the patients with darunavir-associated AEs collected from the FAERS database.
In this study, the signals of SDR and BCPNN were generated by calculating the reporting odds ratio (ROR),
proportional reporting ratio (PRR), information component(IC). These methods were based on two-by-two
contingency (Table 7). An association between drug and an AE was identified when all the three algorithms were
positive. The equations and criteria for the algorithms are shown in Table 850–52. The analyses were conducted
using the Microsoft EXCEL 2010 and SPSS 13.0 statistical software.
