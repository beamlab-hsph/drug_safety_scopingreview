Abstract
Purpose:

Data mining has been introduced as one of the most useful methods for

signal detection by spontaneous reports, but data mining is not always effective in
detecting all safety issues. To investigate appropriate situations in which data mining
is effective in routine signal detection activities, we analyzed the characteristics of
signals that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) identified from the FDA
Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS).
Methods:

Among the signals that the FDA identified from the FAERS between

2008 1Q and 2014 4Q, we selected 233 signals to evaluate in this study. We
conducted a disproportionality analysis and classified these signals into two groups
according to the presence or absence of statistical significance in the reporting odds
ratio (ROR). Then, we compared the two groups based on the characteristics of the
suspected drugs and adverse events (AEs).
Results:

Safety signals were most frequently identified for new drugs that had been

on the market for less than 5 years, but some signals were still identified for old drugs
(≥20 years), and most of them were statistically significant. The proportion of the
signals for “serious” events was significantly higher in the group of nonsignals by
ROR (Fisher's exact test, P = 0.032).
Conclusions:

Data mining was shown to be effective in the following situations: (1)

early detection of safety issues for newly marketed drugs, (2) continuous monitoring
of safety issues for old drugs, and (3) signal detection of nonserious AEs, to which
little attention is usually given.

the time to onset of the AE is short, the reporter can easily recognize it
as an adverse drug reaction and report it accurately. Therefore, it is
easier to detect a signal from spontaneous case reports for the event
whose time to onset is shorter. On the other hand, it is difficult to
detect signals for events whose time to onset is longer from
spontaneous case reports due to underreporting. However, among

events to be assessed further by additional investigations using other
sources because evaluating them only by spontaneous case reports is
often difficult.
Some limitations exist in this study. First, we chose ROR as the
algorithm for our disproportionality analysis. However, the FDA has
employed the empirical Bayes multi‐item gamma Poisson shrinker
(MGPS) as a quantitative method in a routine screening for potential
signals from the FAERS.24 Bayesian methods such as MGPS are
believed to be more robust than frequentist methods such as ROR

or PRR when the number of reports is small.

Among the signals

evaluated in this study, the percentage of the signals that had very
few cases (less than 3 cases) was 9.4%. Therefore, we believe that
they do not have a large influence on the results. Second, we include
only primary suspected drugs in our disproportionality analysis. If the
range of suspected drugs was widened, it may have decreased the
proportion of nonsignals by ROR. However, we were aware of
increasing noise and overestimating signals, so we limited our
disproportionality analysis to primary suspected drugs. Third, in the
classification of the signals according to the time to onset of the
AEs, we calculated the time to onset of the AEs based on the date
information from the FAERS. However, because of the many missing
values for the date information, reports used for the calculation were
limited, and we could not calculate the time to onset for the AEs for
19 signals. Finally, the FDA identifies the signals from the FAERS in
consideration of the information from other sources.4 We did not take
information from sources other than the FAERS into account for our
investigation.
Based on the results of the present study, data mining is particularly effective in the following situations: (1) early detection of safety
issues for newly marketed drugs, (2) continuous monitoring for safety
issues for old drugs, and (3) signal detection of nonserious AEs to
which little attention is usually given.
Many pairs of drugs and AEs are reported daily through spontaneous case reports. Because the types of potential risks are various, it is
important to select and combine suitable methods to identify risks by
considering the characteristics of drugs and AEs. Data mining is a
useful pharmacovigilance method, and regular screening of safety
signals from spontaneous case reports using a data mining technique
is strongly recommended to enhance the structure for routine
pharmacovigilance practice.
