Event Reporting System (FAERS).
Methods: Reports to the FAERS from 1 January 2004 to 31 December 2016 were
analysed. Pharmacovigilance tools were used for quantitative detection of signals
that is, drug‐associated adverse events, including reporting odds ratio, proportional
reporting ratio, information component given by a Bayesian confidence propagation
neural network and empirical Bayes geometric mean. Sensitivity analyses that limited
the data by gender and adverse event date also showed similar trends.
Results: Based on 3721 adverse event reports, all three fluoroquinolones are associ‐
ated with aortic aneurysm, and levofloxacin is associated with aortic dissection. The
risk of aortic aneurysm is higher than the aortic dissection. Oral administration of
fluoroquinolones is more likely to produce these adverse events.
Conclusion: The results obtained herein are consistent with clinical observations,
suggesting the necessity for further clinical research on aortic aneurysm and
dissection associated with fluoroquinolones.

Oral fluoroquinolone use is associated with an increased risk of aortic
aneurysm or dissection based on a recent published nationwide co‐
hort study with enrolment of 720 176 patients.1 However, this study
only evaluated relationships between oral fluoroquinolones and aor‐
tic aneurysm or dissection, the risk relationship in patients receiving
intravenous fluoroquinolones is still unclear.1-3 Furthermore, risks of
aortic aneurysm or dissection associated with various types of fluo‐
roquinolones need further investigation.1-3
Within the past few years, safety assessments on drug utilisa‐
tion in clinical practice have been performed by data mining of large
databases of adverse event spontaneous reporting system.4,5 The
US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Adverse Event Reporting
System (FAERS) is a public database designed to support the FDA's
postmarketing safety surveillance program for drug and therapeu‐
tic biologic products. This database is created on the basis of spon‐
taneous reports to the FDA by health professionals, consumers,
manufacturers and others.4 Reports are evaluated quantitatively by

What's known?
• A recent large epidemiological study found fluoroqui‐
nolone use is associated with an increased risk of aortic
aneurysm or dissection. Within the past few years,
safety assessments on drug utilisation in clinical practice
have been performed by data mining of large adverse
event spontaneous reporting system databases.

What's new?
• By performing a data‐mining analysis of the US FDA
Adverse Event Reporting System, our study reveals that
use of fluoroquinolones is associated with an increased
risk of aortic aneurysm or dissection. Furthermore, risk
of aortic aneurysm is higher than aortic dissection. With
regards to the administration route, oral administration
is more likely to be associated with either aortic aneu‐
rysm or dissection.

the adverse effect of three fluoroquinolones in terms of the risk of
developing aortic aneurysm or dissection was analysed: levofloxacin
is associated with the greatest risk followed by moxifloxacin and ci‐
profloxacin; and (c) the influence of the route of administration was
assessed: oral administration is more likely to produce these adverse
effects than intravenous administration.
While the exact mechanism of fluoroquinolone‐induced aor‐
tic aneurysm or dissection is unknown, several possibilities have
been proposed. Fluoroquinolone‐associated tendinitis and tendon
rupture are widely recognised complications that eventually led
the US FDA to add a black box warning to all fluoroquinolones in
2008.17 The hypothesised biological mechanisms are thought to
be that fluoroquinolones possess chelating properties against sev‐
eral metal ions (eg calcium, magnesium and aluminium), and have
been known to cause direct toxicity to type I collagen synthesis
and promote collagen degradation.18,19 Type I and type III colla‐
gen comprise the majority of collagen in the achilles tendon, 20 and
also comprise the majority (80%‐90%) of collagen in the aorta, 21
thereby suggesting that fluoroquinolones destroy collagen along
the aortic wall leading to aortic aneurysm or dissection as they
do on tendons. Indeed, pathological sections of aortic aneurysms
and dissections demonstrate abnormalities of collagen content,
concentrations and ratios. 22 In a mice study, ciprofloxacin was
found to decrease lysyl oxidase expression and activity, increase
matrix metalloproteinase levels and activity, and increase elastic
fibre fragmentation and cell injury, which may contribute to an
increased susceptibility to stress‐induced aortic destruction. 23
Consistent with our studies, a review of the FAERS discovered that
levofloxacin was the fluoroquinolone associated with the great‐
est risk of tendon rupture among levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and
moxifloxacin, which indicated that levofloxacin had the strongest
adverse effects on collagen. 24
Owing to the limitations of the FAERS database, 25 our data only
indicate an increased risk of aortic aneurysm or dissection with fluo‐
roquinolones, requiring further confirmation.

6 | CO N C LU S I O N S
Our pharmacovigilance analysis of the FAERS reveals that use of
fluoroquinolones is associated with an increased risk of aortic an‐
eurysm or dissection. Careful monitoring for these adverse events
is recommended.
