Abstract. The medical review of adverse event reports for medical products
requires the processing of “big data” stored in spontaneous reporting systems, such
as the US Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). VAERS data are
not well suited to traditional statistical analyses so we developed the FDA Adverse
Event Network Analyzer (AENA) and three novel network analysis approaches to
extract information from these data. Our new approaches include a weighting
scheme based on co-occurring triplets in reports, a visualization layout inspired by
the islands algorithm, and a network growth methodology for the detection of
outliers. We explored and verified these approaches by analysing the historical
signal of Intussusception (IS) after the administration of RotaShield vaccine (RV)
in 1999. We believe that our study supports the use of AENA for pattern
recognition in medical product safety and other clinical data.

Introduction
The Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) is the repository of adverse
events (AEs) reported following immunizations by health care providers, vaccine
recipients, and other interested parties [1]. Specialized personnel assign AE codes from
the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) to each report to represent
the key medical information included in the narratives. Medical experts at the US Food
and Drug Administration (FDA) review VAERS reports by following two approaches.
They use statistical data mining algorithms (DMAs) to assess whether an AE is
reported disproportionately for one product compared to others [2]. They also conduct
manual review of reports to identify unusual patterns in demographics, exposures,
medical history, and clinical characteristics that might suggest a safety issue.
The current process has two main limitations: DMAs do not evaluate the
interactions among co-administered vaccines and multiple AEs in the VAERS database,
and manual review is time intensive and the consistency of human pattern recognition
is unknown. Previously, we proposed representing VAERS as a network of AEs and

vaccines to expose their interactions [3]. We developed the Adverse Event Network
Analyzer (AENA) because the existing network tools cannot handle our 3-mode data
(reports, vaccines, AEs) that must be presented in a dynamic environment. AENA
incorporates the traditional network analysis techniques as well as some new
functionalities and algorithms. Here, we mainly focus on the novel network analysis
aspects of AENA through a particular example of a safety surveillance signal.

1. Methods
1.1. Novel Network Analysis Algorithmic Approaches
The medical experts at the FDA run ad-hoc queries on the VAERS database to select
the reports of interest and launch AENA. AENA supports the creation of 1- and 2mode networks by treating the vaccines and AEs as the same or different type of
objects, respectively; the 1-mode network is created at the initial launch of the tool. As
we have previously shown, the report elements (vaccines and AEs) and their cooccurrence in the same report(s) are best represented as the nodes and edges,
respectively, in a network [3, 4]. The edges are initially weighted based on the number
of reports in which two elements co-occur. The weighted networks support the
application of our novel algorithms and facilitate the identification of clusters and
safety patterns. Pattern identification often involves “reducing” a network by
systematically eliminating “noisy” nodes and edges. AENA uses several approaches to
network reduction, including those based on traditional measures of node connectivity,
as well as novel alternative edge weighting, outlier detection based on a preferential
attachment model of network formation, and application of the “islands” algorithm.

(any pairing, only AE pairings, only vaccine pairings) in AENA.

Apart from the report-based weighting (RW), AENA supports two more weighting
schemes. The first is supported by an algorithm that looks at each edge and counts the
triangles in which the edge is included (topological weighting - TW). For the same
edge, the second scheme focuses on the report level and counts all the report triplets in
which the corresponding pair participates (co-occurrence weighting - CW). Either
scheme returns three types of weights based on whether the “third node” in the triangle
is a vaccine, an AE, or either. The new weights may potentially change the network
topology, e.g. “RV” and “Rash” participate in one topological or co-occurrence triangle
only, so their edge disappears in either case when the “third node” is an AE (Figure 1).
An additional novel functionality allows the identification of nodes with extreme
attributes. The “Tolerance Band View” (TBV) was based on the idea of looking at the
VAERS network growth over time [5] and displays a scatterplot of vaccines and AEs
(Figure 2). The x-axis represents report ID; nodes receive an x-value based on the first
report ID in which they appear. The x-value is a proxy for the time at which the node
first appears in the network because IDs are assigned sequentially. It is important to
account for time of appearance, because earlier appearing nodes have greater chance of
connecting with other nodes, and are more likely to have higher connectivity as
measured by network metrics (e.g., node degree). The y-axis represents the node metric
score (degree, Figure 2) and nodes receive a y-value based on their metric value within
the entire network.
AENA can visualize the networks using multiple layouts: the force-directed, circle,
self-organizing map, and principal components layouts. It is also equipped with a novel
layout option inspired by the “islands algorithm” and calculates an island height for the
nodes based on their edge weights and their connections to other nodes [6]. Our islands
layout places the two most strongly connected nodes at the very top of the visualization,
and arranges all other nodes beneath according to their strength of connection with
other nodes (i.e., island height). When two nodes are tightly connected to each other,
they will appear at the same horizontal level (Figure 3). This layout also supports the
selection of “network slices” to include nodes located at the same level(s).

In addition to the above novel algorithmic approaches, AeNA supports common
NA techniques, such as the node and edge removal, the calculation of node centrality
metrics and the network export to an edge list or Pajek format for further analysis.
1.2. Analysis of RotaShield Reports
We explored the known signal of intussusception (IS) that followed the administration
of RotaShield Vaccine (RV) in 1999 [7]. We created the network in AENA using all
the RV reports submitted to VAERS from the licensure to the withdrawal date of RV.
The edges were initially weighted based on the number of reports a pair of elements cooccurred (i.e., RW network). We also applied our topological and co-occurrence
triangular weighting scheme by defining the AE as the “third node” of the triangle and
assigned the new weights to the edges (i.e., TW and CW network, respectively). To
evaluate the AENA’s ability to identify the pattern, we applied two reduction steps to
all networks: (i) we selected the “IS” nodes and nodes directly connected to IS, and
created the corresponding subnetwork; (ii) we created a subnetwork of AE nodes. We
then ran the TBV for subnetworks (i) and identified the nodes above the upper
tolerance band. We visually evaluated the differences between the RW, TW and CW
subnetworks (ii) using the island layout.

2. Results
The TBV for the subnetworks (i) was the same, irrespective of the weighting scheme
used when degree, betweenness or closeness metrics of network connectivity were
selected. Intussusception was the only node that fell outside the confidence bounds for
degree centrality for high parameters values (Figure 2). The visualizations of the three

1182

subnetworks (i) (Figure 3) showed that RV and IS did appear in the same reports (they
were both on the same vertical axis). However, the visualizations were dominated by
the vaccine elements and the IS pattern was noisy. The subsequent creation of the AE
networks removed the noise and revealed the presence of IS and other gastrointestinal
AEs. Figure 3 shows subnetworks (i) and (ii) for the 3 schemes; the top layers of the
island layout are shown for the subnetworks (ii). Our novel CW scheme best supported
the pattern identification by placing the IS on the top of the topology, whereas RW and
TW schemes hid its significant role by assigning more island height to other AEs.

3. Discussion
This study demonstrates the potential use of AENA for the pattern identification in
safety surveillance data. We used the example of a known historical signal to explore
the multiple interactions between the elements of reports and fill the gap of the existing
DMAs. Guided by our previous studies in the area [3-5], we pursued the calculation of
CWs that look at the triangular clusters formed at the report level and assign more
value to the pairwise connections that participate in many triangles. This is of value
when the triangles are related to a pattern in the full set of reports. The use of any AE
as the “third node” assisted us in focusing on the AE patterns. Our approach performed
best when compared to the traditional RW and TW schemes. This was nicely illustrated
by the islands layout that incorporates various topological and weighting parameters.
Our study has certain limitations. First, we did not perform an exhaustive analysis
of patterns with different characteristics and it is not possible to draw firm conclusions
for the generalizability of our work. Second, we did not conduct a statistical analysis of
the results, but visually compared the network representations. Third, we explored the
novel functionalities of the tool only, while other options are available.
To our knowledge, this is the first network analysis tool developed for safety
surveillance (or any medical) purposes. The edge weighting based on the information
that is included at the document level has not been presented before. Future research
should focus on the contribution of such weighting to the creation of document-based
networks and their application to spontaneous reporting systems for safety surveillance.
