ABSTRACT
Objectives To detect the signals for drospirenone-­
containing oral contraceptives (DCOCs) and describe the
reporting pattern of adverse events (AEs) caused by DCOCs
compared with levonorgestrel/desogestrel/gestodene-­
containing (second/third generation) oral contraceptives.
Design A descriptive analysis of claims data.
Setting The Korea Institute of Drug Safety & Risk
Management-­Korea Adverse Event Reporting System
Database from 1 February 2008 to 31 December 2017.
Outcome measures Signals for DCOCs were identified
using three data mining indices. The characteristics,
death cases, and the annual pattern of AE reports were
compared between DCOCs and second/third generation
oral contraceptives.
Results Of the 242 DCOC-­related AEs, 54 signals were
detected and 10 were identified as new signals that were
not included in Korea, US and UK label. The newly detected
signals include deep vein thrombophlebitis and frequent
urination. Serious AEs were more likely to be reported with
DCOCs (7.85%) than with second/third generation oral
contraceptives (2.92%). Five deaths after use of DCOCs
were reported with vascular AEs, such as pulmonary
embolism and thrombosis, whereas one death after use of
second/third generation oral contraceptives was reported
with the cardiac arrest.
Conclusions We identified 10 new signals related
to DCOCs that were not included in the current label.
Additionally, we found higher reports of the deaths and
vascular AEs associated with DCOCs than with second/
third generation oral contraceptives, which warrants
careful monitoring to ensure the safe use of DCOCs.

INTRODUCTION
Oral contraceptives were developed to help
with healthy timing of pregnancies and
prevent unintended pregnancies. Enovid,
the first hormonal pill, was approved by the
US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
in 1960, and in the subsequent years, oral
contraceptives have evolved with regard to
their composition.1 Nowadays, combined

Strengths and limitations of this study
►► We analysed signals of drospirenone-­
containing

oral contraceptives (DCOCs) through the large spontaneous report data in Korea to provide additional
safety information on using the DCOCs.
►► The proportional reporting ratio, adjusted reporting
OR from a multivariate model and the information
component were used as data mining algorithm to
detect signals.
►► Due to the nature of spontaneous adverse event
reporting system, it is limited in that the adverse
events are under-­reported and the data quality is
inconsistent.
►► As our study design is descriptive epidemiological
study, further analytical studies will be needed to
confirm a causal relationship between DCOCs and
signals.

oral contraceptives are predominantly used,
comprising oestrogen and progestin, which
inhibit the secretion of follicle stimulating
hormone and luteinising hormone, respectively.2 Although some common adverse drug
reactions (ADRs), such as nausea (32.9%),
menstrual disorder (14.3%) and dizziness
(12.7%), occur after the use of oral contraceptives, they are used widely to control the
menstruation cycle (60.8%), as contraception (47.1%) and to cure disease (5.8%).3
Currently, more than 100 million women
worldwide use oral contraceptives.
Since the FDA approved drospirenone-­
containing oral contraceptives (DCOCs),
which were the latest developed oral contraceptives, safety concerns related to blood
clots and venous thromboembolism have
been raised. Owing to these safety concerns,
the FDA conducted a post-­
marketing
surveillance study and in 2012, labelled the

DCOCs with a higher risk of thrombosis than with other
contraceptives.4 South Korea also included these results
of the post-­
marketing surveillance to label DCOCs;
cardiovascular diseases such as pulmonary embolism (PE) and venous thromboembolism (VTE) were
listed as cautions.5 Accordingly, a recent meta-­analysis
reported an increased risk of DCOCs compared with
the use of levonorgestrel-­
containing oral contraceptives.6 However, given the focus on risk of blood clots
in previous studies,6 7 it is necessary to detect an overall
signal for DCOCs that have not yet been investigated for
the safe use of DCOCs.
Signal detection for drug adverse events (AEs) is a data
mining technique to complement the traditional expert
review of the spontaneous ADR reports and to analyse the
large volume of data rapidly.8 This technique is used to
explore spontaneous report databases for hidden associations between drugs and reported ADRs that cannot
be identified by manual case assessment. To our knowledge, no studies have reported the detection of signals
associated with DCOCs using the Korean spontaneous AE
reporting system database. Additionally, comparison of
reported AEs and demographic characteristics between
DCOCs and second/third generation oral contraceptives
has not been studied.
Therefore, the purpose of our study was to detect
unknown signals of DCOCs and analyse the patterns of
reported AEs compared with those of second/third generation oral contraceptive drugs. We aimed to compare the
detected signals with the drug labels used in Korea, the
USA and the UK.

METHODS
Database
We used the AE data related to DCOCs and second/third
generation oral contraceptives from the Korea Institute
of Drug Safety & Risk Management-­Korea Adverse Event
Reporting System Database (KIDS-­KD). We collected the
data from February 2008 to December 2017, considering
the approval date of DCOCs in Korea. The KIDS-­
KD
includes information on patient demographics, the
suspected drug, AEs, serious AEs (SAEs), the reporter, a
causality assessment and medical history.9 In this study, all
information was integrated using the randomised report
number. A randomised report number is a new number
given to individual patients when building the KIDS-­KD
from the Korea Adverse Events Reporting System Database (KAERS). As the original report number from
KAERS is randomised, individual patients cannot be
distinguished.
Study drug and data extraction
We selected our study drugs as DCOCs and the comparator drugs as second/third generation oral contraceptives that contained levonorgestrel, desogestrel or
gestodene as progestin. From the initial data, all duplicates were removed and only the potential drug cases
and initial reports were included. In addition, among the
report types of spontaneous, research, article or other,
we included the spontaneous and research report type
formats only. The final data included 2013 case reports
for DCOCs and 4350 case reports for second/third generation oral contraceptives (figure 1). By using one-­to-­one
correspondence between the drug and the AEs in each
report, 3463 and 7926 drug–AE pairs were created for

DCOCs and second/third generation oral contraceptives,
respectively.
The reported AEs were coded by the preferred term
(PT), one of the four components of WHO Adverse Reaction Terminology, which has been developed by the WHO
Uppsala Monitoring Centre. The causality of drug–AE
pairs was evaluated using the WHO-­causality assessment
programme and we only included ‘certain,’ ‘probable’
and ‘possible’ drug–AE pairs in our analysis.
Characterisation of cases of death among SAEs
The cases of death caused after DCOCs and second/third
generation oral contraceptives were characterised by the
date on which the AE was recognised to have occurred,
the age, if hospitalisation occurred, the PT of the AE and
a causality assessment.
Statistical analysis
The proportion and frequency of DCOC AE reports were
analysed by age, period of use, SAEs and reporters. Age
was categorised into four groups: 1–19, 20–29, 30–39 and
over 40 years of age. The following groups were analysed for period of use: 0–1, 1–3, 3–5 and over 5 months,
and the AE reporters were doctors, pharmacists, nurses,
consumers and others. The AE reports of DCOCs were
compared with second/third generation oral contraceptives using the Χ2 test. PT descriptions were used to investigate the type and frequency of AEs.
Drug–AE pairs and the number of AE reports were
separately analysed to fulfil different purposes. Drug–AE
pairs were analysed to investigate the frequency and type
of AEs reported for DCOCs and second/third generation
oral contraceptives. Based on the number of AE reports,
the annual proportion of SAEs of the total number of AEs
reported for DCOCs and second/third generation oral
contraceptives was calculated from 2008 to 2017.
Data mining techniques were used in this study. Quantitative signal detection is widely used to analyse the spontaneous reports and aims to find true signals and avoid
false positives.10 The measurement of disproportionality
is one method for quantitative signal detection and there
are several measures. To identify signals, we calculated
disproportionality using the proportional reporting
ratios (PRRs),11 reporting OR (ROR)12 and Bayesian
confidence propagation neural networks of information
components with the lower limit for 95% CI (IC025).13 To
supplement the uncertainty of any estimates, CIs and Χ2
tests are used to determine the threshold.14 A 2×2 contingency table with the DCOCs and second/third generation oral contraceptives as the rows and specific AE and
all other AEs as the columns was designed and used for
the calculation. The PRR was defined as the ratio of the
reporting rate of a certain AE among all the AEs for a
DCOC to the reporting rates for a second/third generation oral contraceptive. The criteria for signals were
PRR ≥2, ≥4 and the number of AEs ≥3.11 The ROR is
the odds of the reporting rate for one specific AE when
exposed to a DCOC compared with the reporting rate for
Lee Y, et al. BMJ Open 2021;11:e045948. doi:10.1136/bmjopen-2020-045948

a specific AE after exposure to a second/third generation
oral contraceptive. We calculated crude ROR using 2×2
contingency table and adjusted ROR by logistic regression analysis. Patient’s age group, whether SAE or not,
and the type of AE reporter were used as covariate for
adjustment. To be classified as a signal, the criteria were
adjusted ROR ≥2, ≥4 and the number of AEs ≥3.15 16
When the number of AE of interest with second/third
generation oral contraceptives is 0, the PRR and ROR
cannot be computed; thus, we set the values at 99.9 arbitrarily to reflect a potential signal.17 IC is the log of the
probability of an AE after use of a drug divided by the
product of the probability of AE and the probability of
the drug when it is assumed that the drug use and occurrence of AE are independent. When the lower limit of the
95% CI of the IC is greater than zero, it is considered as
a signal.18 In this study, AEs that satisfy at least one of the
criteria for three indices (PRR, adjusted ROR and IC025)
were detected as a signal.
We compared the detected signals with the drug labels
in Korea, the USA and the UK. We obtained the label

RESULTS
The total numbers of AEs reported for DCOCs and
second/third generation oral contraceptives between
2008 and 2017 were 2013 and 4350, which corresponded
to 3463 and 7926 drug–AE pairs, respectively. Among 4350
of AE reports for second/third generation oral contraceptives, 330 was reported for second generation oral
contraceptives (figure 1). For both DCOCs and second/
third generation oral contraceptives, the proportions of
reported AEs were highest in the age of 20s, followed by
the age of 30s and finally those over 40 years (p<0.0001).
For the period of use, the occurrence of AEs after using
DCOCs and second/third generation oral contraceptives
for 0–1 month was highest, and the proportion attributable to DCOCs was higher in the groups of 1–3 months,
3–5 months and over 5 months than that for the comparator drugs (p<0.0001). In terms of reporting group,
higher reporting frequencies for DCOC-­related AEs were
observed from the pharmacists, nurses and doctors than
that for comparator drugs (p<0.001) (table 1).
The number of SAEs from the total number of AEs was
158 out of 2013 (7.85%) for DCOCs and 127 out of 4350

(2.92%) for second/third generation oral contraceptives; however, this difference was not statistically significant (p=0.2333). Among the SAEs, five cases of death
were reported for DCOCs and one case was reported for
second/third generation oral contraceptives (table 1).
All these cases of death occurred in the age group of 20s
and 30s. For the deaths observed after use of DCOCs,
vascular diseases such as PE, hypoesthesia, thrombosis,
atherosclerosis and thromboembolism were reported as
AEs. Of the five cases, two cases were rated with ‘possible’
causality and one case accompanied hospitalisation. For
the death observed after use of second/third generation
oral contraceptives, the reported AE was cardiac arrest
(table 2).
The proportion of SAEs among the total AEs reported
after DCOCs unexpectedly increased in 2011, at 25.79%,
which was higher than the value with the second/third
generation oral contraceptives, 6.41% (figure 2). The
number of AEs and SAEs for DCOCs and second/third
generation oral contraceptives and the number of AEs
reported for all drugs through KIDS-­KD from 2008 to
2017 are presented in online supplemental table 1.
The type and frequency of AE after use of oral contraceptives analysed by WHO-­
PT classification are shown
in online supplemental table 2. Of the 3463 AE reports
for DCOCs, 242 types of AE were reported, and the
most common AEs were menstrual disorder (11.78%),
nausea (8.55%), vaginal haemorrhage (7.83%), vomit
(3.93%) and headache (3.81%). Of the 7926 AE reports
for second/third generation oral contraceptives, inappropriate administration schedule was most common
(17.04%), followed by menstrual disorder (10.65%),
vaginal haemorrhage (10.56%) and medication error
(9.17%).
The detected signals of DCOCs are listed together with
the value of PRR, adjusted ROR and IC025 in table 3. Crude
and adjusted RORs with 95% CIs are presented in online

supplemental table 3. There were 22 signals that satisfied
the three criteria and the signals included xerophthalmia,
endometriosis, thrombosis and varicose vein. Of the 22
signals, intrauterine device complication, dyspnoea, chest
pain, and fatigue were unlabelled in Korea, the USA and
the UK. There were 25 signals that met two criteria, PRR
and ROR or IC025; these signals included hypertrichosis
and urinary incontinence. Among them, the AEs of pneumothorax, osteoporosis, pallor, deep vein thrombophlebitis, tinnitus, and frequent urination were unlabelled in
Korea, the USA and the UK. The AEs that satisfied only
one criterion included myalgia, insomnia, oedema generalised, vaginitis and candidiasis genital. Among them,
myalgia and insomnia were unlabelled AEs in Korea and
the USA.
DISCUSSION
This study described the AE characteristics and signal
after use of DCOCs compared with second/third generation oral contraceptives between February 2008 and
December 2017. AEs after use of DCOCs were reported
from older group compared with second/third generation oral contraceptives; moreover, they used the drugs
for longer period, thus, increasing the chance of a thrombotic event. Five cases of death were reported after the
use of DCOCs through KIDS-­KD and were all reported
with vascular diseases, which are SAEs. We detected 54
signals associated with DCOCs; these signals included
xerophthalmia, endometriosis, thrombosis and varicose
vein. Of the 54 signals, 10, including dyspnoea, chest pain
and frequent urination, were unlabelled in Korea, the
USA and the UK.
For both DCOCs and second/third generation oral
contraceptives, the AE reports were highest in the group
with 0–1 months of drug use. Previous research has indicated that the risk of venous thrombosis was highest
during the first 3 months of oral contraceptive use.19 The
Lee Y, et al. BMJ Open 2021;11:e045948. doi:10.1136/bmjopen-2020-045948

frequency of AE reported by professionals was higher for
DCOCs than for second/third generation oral contraceptives. This might be due to the fact that DCOCs are
prescription drugs and second/third generation oral
contraceptives are over-­the-­counter drugs in Korea. The
AEs and SAEs for DCOCs were first reported in 2010.
The proportion of SAEs from the total number of AEs
was highest in 2011 and in the following year, the FDA
issued a safety alert on thrombosis and VTE.4 After the
FDA alert, the proportions of SAEs among total AEs for
DCOCs have decreased. The proportion of SAEs among
total AEs for second/third generation oral contraceptives
was 50% in 2009. However, the reported numbers of SAEs
and AEs were 1 and 2, respectively; therefore, it should be
interpreted with caution.
Our results are similar to case reports in Japan, where
three deaths after taking DCOCs were reported, all caused
by vascular diseases such as intracranial venous sinus
thrombosis, PE and deep vein thrombosis.20 In a previous
study that aimed to analyse the AEs induced by DCOCs
using the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System, the signal
related to ‘venous thrombotic,’ first appeared in 2002
and persisted until 2015, at the time when the IC05 for
DCOCs was five times higher than that for levonorgestrel-­
containing oral contraceptives.7 Our study also suggested
the risk of AE associated with ‘venous thrombotic’, such
as thrombosis, varicose vein, PE, cerebral infarction and
thromboembolism. Hence, among the newly detected
signals, which were unlabelled in Korea, the USA and the
UK, deep vein thrombophlebitis was identified, which
might be in line with the risk of thrombosis.
The risk of VTE after the use of DCOCs has been an
issue in many countries, including Korea. However, there
has much been controversy regarding the effects of oral
contraceptives on thrombosis. One study has confirmed
that during the use of oral contraceptives, the level of
coagulant factors and prothrombin increases,21 which is

associated with the increased risk of venous thrombosis.
Nevertheless, individual susceptibilities and external risk
factors should also be considered when interpreting the
data.22 Moreover, oral contraceptives contain doses of 20
or 30 µg of oestrogen and 21 or 24 tablets per month,
which indicates the heterogeneity of formulations. A
recent study found a cardiovascular safety profile for
oestrogen-­free contraceptive containing 4 mg of drospirenone;23 therefore, further study is required to explore
whether the risk of thrombosis is different among formulations of oral contraceptives.
Among the signals that were unlabelled in Korea, the
USA and the UK, frequent urination was detected as a
signal. The detection of frequent urination and decrease
in weight is attributed to the fact that drospirenone is
an analogue of spironolactone, an aldosterone receptor
antagonist, which reduces sodium reabsorption and
induces the excretion of water in the kidney.24 Additionally, spironolactone inhibits the action of testosterone and
stimulates the synthesis of oestradiol, which leads to AEs
such as chest pain, an unlabelled signal.25 As an increase
in the concentration of oestradiol cause nausea,26 signals
such as headache, urticaria and nausea were detected for
DCOCs.
This study has several strengths. First, we used the
nationwide database from the spontaneous AE reporting
system, which is an important tool to detect unknown and
rare adverse reactions that occur after market approval.27
This database includes all spontaneously reported AE
Lee Y, et al. BMJ Open 2021;11:e045948. doi:10.1136/bmjopen-2020-045948

which has been collected for more than 1 million patients
in Korea. In addition, we compared the labels of DCOCs
between Korea, the USA and the UK, and identified
the unlisted signals. Second, unlike the previous study,
we compared the AEs and demographic characteristics
between DCOCs and previous generation oral contraceptives. There was a study on the risks of DCOCs conducted
using the spontaneous AE reporting system,7 but comparisons on the characteristics of AE reports with respect
to other oral contraceptives were not made. Third, we
conducted data mining using three different statistical
indices, PRR, ROR and IC025, to account for inconsistent
signal detection results due to their varying levels of specificity in defining AEs and signal score threshold.
However, this study also has some limitations. First, due
to the nature of passive spontaneous AE reporting system
that we used in this study, the under-­reporting of AEs
cannot be avoided.28 Therefore, every AE after drug use
cannot be collected by this reporting system. Second, there
was no information about the total number of patients
who have taken the drug. The prevalence of DCOCs and
other generations of oral contraceptives should be examined in future studies. According to a report released by
United Nations, the estimated prevalence of oral contraceptive use among women in South Korea was 3.3%,
which is relatively lower than that of the USA (13.7%) or
the UK (26.1%).29 Third, information on previous oral
contraceptive drug use, which could be an important
factor in evaluating their adverse effects, was not available

in the spontaneous AE reporting system. Fourth, when
calculating adjusted ROR, the estimates may be biased by
residual confounding. We included patient’s age group,
period of use and the type of AE reporter in the multivariate analysis as covariates, as patients who used DCOCs
tended to be older, used drugs for a longer period, and
had higher frequencies of reporting from the group of
doctors, pharmacists, and nurses. However, there were
not enough variables available for the adjustment due to
too many missing values. In addition, numerous factors
including body mass index and smoking affecting the
relationship between the drug and the AE could not be
considered due to inherent limitations of pharmacovigilance data. For example, smoking is a risk factor for thrombosis and acts synergistically when administered with oral
contraceptives.30 However, it is hard to know whether the
patient is a smoker or a non-­smoker through the spontaneous reports. Therefore, higher level evidence-­based
studies should be conducted to determine whether other
factors can affect AEs that were detected as signals. Lastly,
KIDS-­KD does not represent patients worldwide. Further
pharmacoepidemiological studies that include overseas
data are required. Although there are some limitations,
this study is significant as it is the first study to detect
signals of DCOCs using KIDS-­KD. As the population of
women taking oral contraceptives increases,31 the detection of signals in advance will be important to prevent
unexpected AEs.

CONCLUSIONS
To conclude, statistically significant differences in the
patterns of AEs between DCOCs and previous generation
oral contraceptives were observed. In addition, deaths
and SAEs, including vascular diseases, were more often
reported with DCOCs than with second/third generation oral contraceptives. We also detected signals of AE
including cardiovascular events (eg, thrombosis, varicose
vein, cerebral infarction and thromboembolism) and new
signals which were not identified in Korea, US and UK
label in relation to DCOCs. Although the evidence from
signal detections is not conclusive, it helps to develop
new hypotheses of causal relationship. Further analytical
studies will be needed to identify the causality between
oral contraceptives and AEs.
