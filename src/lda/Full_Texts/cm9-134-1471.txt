Abstract
Background: Taxanes are an essential class of antineoplastic agents used to treat various cancers and are a fundamental cause of
hypersensitivity reactions. In addition, other adverse events, such as bone marrow toxicity and peripheral neuropathy, can lead to
chemotherapy discontinuation. This study aimed to evaluate the safety of taxanes in the real world.
Methods: Taxane-associated adverse events were identiﬁed by the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities Preferred Terms and
analyzed and compared by mining the US Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System pharmacovigilance
database from January 2004 to December 2019. Reported adverse events, such as hypersensitivity reaction, bone marrow toxicity,
and peripheral neuropathy, were analyzed with the following signal detection algorithms: reporting odds ratio (ROR), proportional
reporting ratio (PRR), multi-item gamma Poisson shrinker (MGPS), Bayesian conﬁdence propagation neural network (BCPNN),
and logistic regression methods. Adverse outcome events and death outcome rates were compared between different taxane groups
using Pearson’s x2 test, whereas signiﬁcance was determined at P < 0.05 with a 95% conﬁdence interval (CI).
Results: A total of 966 reports of hypersensitivity reactions, 1109 reports of bone marrow toxicity, and 1374 reports of peripheral
neuropathy were analyzed. Compared with paclitaxel and docetaxel, bone marrow toxicity following the use of nab-paclitaxel
had the highest ROR of 6.45 (95% two-sided CI, 6.05–6.88), PRR of 5.66, (x2 = 4342.98), information component of 2.50 (95%
one-sided CI = 2.34), and empirical Bayes geometric mean of 5.64 (95% one-sided CI = 5.34). Peripheral neuropathy following
the use of nab-paclitaxel showed a higher ROR of 12.78 (95% two-sided CI, 11.55–14.14), PRR of 12.16 (x2 = 4060.88),
information component of 3.59 (95% one-sided CI = 3.25), and empirical Bayes geometric mean of 12.07 (95% one-sided
CI = 11.09).
Conclusions: The results showed that bone marrow toxicity and peripheral neuropathy were the major adverse events induced by
taxanes. Nab-paclitaxel exhibited the highest potential for taxane-associated adverse events. Further research in the future is
warranted to explain taxane-associated adverse effects in real-world circumstances.

Introduction
Taxanes (paclitaxel, docetaxel, and nab-paclitaxel) represent a catalog of antineoplastic agents that interfere with
microtube function, which leads to altered mitosis and
cellular death. Paclitaxel was initially extracted from the
Paciﬁc yew tree (Taxus brevifolia). Due to paclitaxel
scarcity, docetaxel was initially developed from the
European yew tree (Taxus baccata).[1] Paclitaxel (solvent-based paclitaxel) is formulated in a mixture of the
vehicle called Cremophor EL (polyoxyethylenated castor
oil) and ethanol (50:50 v/v). Nab-paclitaxel is a solventfree albumin-bound nanoparticle formulation of paclitaxel
that is readily reconstituted in saline.[2] Taxanes are a class
of antineoplastic agents widely used for the treatment of

several types of cancers, such as breast cancer and lung
cancer.[3] Although the application of chemotherapy is
essential for improving patient survival, taxane-associated
adverse events can lead to the discontinuation of
chemotherapy. Physicians are familiar with the concept
that taxanes are an indispensable cause of hypersensitivity
reactions in cancer patients.[4] Other adverse events can
also limit the smooth progress of chemotherapy, such as
bone marrow toxicity and peripheral neuropathy. The use
of taxanes can cause bone marrow toxicity, such as
transient neutrophilic granulopenia.[5] The application of
taxanes typically leads to microtube impairment, neuroimmune and inﬂammatory changes, ion channel remodeling, impaired mitochondrial function, and genetic
predisposition, which might be the mechanisms of
peripheral neuropathy.[6]

The US Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA’s) Adverse
Event Reporting System (FAERS) is the largest pharmacovigilance (PV) system available for adverse drug events
reported by health professionals, consumers, and manufacturers. The purpose of the establishment of FAERS is to
monitor the safety proﬁle of postmarketing drugs and
therapeutic biologics. We aimed to assess taxane-associated adverse events by investigating the FAERS due to the
scarcity of knowledge following taxane administration in
real-world practice.
Methods
Data source
A retrospective PV study was conducted using data from
FAERS quarterly data ﬁles dated from January 2004 to
December 2019. Demographic and administrative information and the initial report image ID number, drug
information from the case reports, reaction information,
patient outcome information, information on the source of
the reports, and a “README” ﬁle containing a description of the data ﬁles were included in the quarterly data
ﬁles.
According to US FDA recommendations, the deduplication process should be performed while selecting the latest
FDA_DT if the case ID is identical. A higher primary ID
was assigned if the case ID and FDA_DT were the same. A
total of 966 reports associated with a hypersensitivity
reaction, 1109 reports of bone marrow toxicity, and 1374
reports of peripheral neuropathy were obtained from the
FAERS database.
Drug and adverse event identiﬁcation
We chose a list of generic and brand names of paclitaxel,
docetaxel, and nab-paclitaxel using www.drugbank.ca as
a dictionary for data mining. The generic and brand names
of taxanes were listed in Supplementary Digital Content,
Table 1, http://links.lww.com/CM9/A606. Generic names
and brand names were both included as keywords for the
FAERS database search. We investigated in the REAC ﬁles
for comprehensive MedDRA v22.1 (International Council
of Harmonization) preferred terms (PTs) related to adverse
events, such as hypersensitivity reaction, bone marrow
toxicity, and peripheral neuropathy. Taxane-associated
adverse events and preferred terms were listed in
Supplementary Digital Content, Table 2, http://links.
lww.com/CM9/A606.
Data mining
Four statistical procedures were applied in the data mining
process mainly based on disproportionality analysis and
Bayesian analysis, such as reporting odds ratio (ROR),
proportional reporting ratio (PRR), multi-item gamma
Poisson shrinker (MGPS), and Bayesian conﬁdence
propagation neural network (BCPNN). These algorithms
were used in combination to identify the association
between a particular drug and a speciﬁc adverse event.[7-15]
The major algorithms used for signal detection were

summarized in Supplementary Digital Content, Table 3,
http://links.lww.com/CM9/A606.
The time to onset and death outcomes due to taxaneassociated adverse events were assessed. The time to onset
was deﬁned as the interval between the date of occurrence
of adverse events (EVENT_DT) and the start date of
taxane administration (START_DT). Input errors, such as
an earlier EVENT_DT than START_DT and inaccurate
date entries, should be excluded. The result of death
outcome was calculated as the total number of lethal
adverse events divided by the total number of taxaneassociated hypersensitivity reactions, bone marrow toxicity, and peripheral neuropathy.
Statistical analysis
We used descriptive analyses to summarize the clinical
characteristics of taxane-associated adverse events, such as
hypersensitivity reactions, bone marrow toxicity, and
peripheral neuropathy, collected from the FAERS. Given
that the data were typically not normally distributed, the
times to onset of hypersensitivity reaction, bone marrow
toxicity, and peripheral neuropathy between different
taxane administrations were compared with non-parametric tests (using the Kruskal-Wallis test when there were
more than two subgroups of respondents and the MannWhitney test when there were dichotomous variables).
Adverse outcome events and death outcome rates were
compared using Pearson’s x2 test between different taxane
groups. All statistical analyses and data mining processes
were performed with Statistical Analysis System v. 9.4
(SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA), whereas statistical
signiﬁcance was determined at P < 0.05 with a 95%
conﬁdence interval (CI).
Results
Clinical characteristics of the patients
Of all taxane-associated adverse reports from the FAERS
database, 8721 reports of hypersensitivity reactions, 4964
reports of bone marrow toxicity, and 1374 reports of
peripheral neuropathy were analyzed. Most of the
hypersensitivity reaction reports and peripheral neuropathy were associated with paclitaxel (52.07% and 41.41%,
respectively), whereas most of the bone marrow toxicity
reports were caused by docetaxel (46.15%). The clinical
characteristics of the patients are shown in Table 1.
Adverse events associated with taxanes were mainly
reported by healthcare professionals. Female patients
experienced more adverse events, such as hypersensitivity
reactions, bone marrow toxicity, and peripheral neuropathy.
Signal detection
Paclitaxel exhibited a positive signal in ROR associated
with hypersensitivity reactions, whereas docetaxel and
nab-paclitaxel showed a negative signal. Nab-paclitaxel
showed the highest signal associated with bone marrow

agents had positive signals in ROR, PRR, BCPNN, and
MGPS. The results of signal detection were shown in Table 2.

Time to onset of taxane-associated hypersensitivity
reaction, bone marrow toxicity, and peripheral neuropathy
The time to onset of the hypersensitivity reaction with nabpaclitaxel (45.91 days) was signiﬁcantly later than that
with docetaxel (35.10 days), P < 0.0001, and that for
docetaxel was signiﬁcantly later compared with paclitaxel
(23.76 days), P < 0.0001. The time to onset of bone
marrow toxicity by nab-paclitaxel (46.54 days) was
signiﬁcantly later than docetaxel (40.20 days), P <
0.0001, and that of paclitaxel (45.32 days) was signiﬁcantly later than docetaxel, P < 0.0001. It can be
concluded that the time to onset of neuropathy peripherally with nab-paclitaxel (91.49 days) was signiﬁcantly later
than that with docetaxel (34.82 days), P < 0.0001, and
signiﬁcantly later than that with paclitaxel (61.19 days), P
= 0.0019. The times to onset of taxane-associated adverse
events are shown in Figure 1.
Outcome due to taxane-associated adverse events
To evaluate the adverse effect of taxanes, we assessed both
death and non-death outcomes following paclitaxel,
docetaxel, and nab-paclitaxel, and the results are shown
in Table 3. Although paclitaxel required more intervention
to prevent permanent impairment (4.35%), it showed a
lower death rate (9.77%) caused by hypersensitivity
reaction. Nab-paclitaxel showed a cautious higher death
rate (31.05%) caused by neuropathy peripheral.

Discussion
To the best of our knowledge, this is a novel study
describing the connection between taxane-associated
adverse events in the real-world setting based on the
FAERS PV database.
In our study, bone marrow toxicity and neuropathy

Data are presented as n (%).

paclitaxel were conﬁrmed by the positive signals of ROR,
PRR, BCPNN, and MGPS. Among them, nab-paclitaxel
shows the highest signal. Cremophor is not used as the
vehicle in nab-paclitaxel, and no infusion reactions were
observed in phases I, II, and III studies of nab-paclitaxel
omission of routine premedication.[16-18] We should focus
on avoiding bone marrow toxicity and neuropathy
peripheral events, although nab-paclitaxel is always
considered safer.[19]
Paclitaxel shows a positive ROR signal, whereas docetaxel
and nab-paclitaxel show a negative hypersensitivity
reaction signal. There is evidence that both the taxane
component and the vehicles used to solubilize these agents
can cause various infusion reactions.[20] Among the
proposed mechanisms underlying paclitaxel, infusion
reactions are complement activation, direct mast cell/
basophil activation, and classic immunoglobulin E-mediated anaphylaxis due to Cremophor and docetaxel
infusion reactions due to polysorbate 80.[21-23] Based on
the FAERS data, there is no evidence that taxane use
produces a strong positive signal related to the hypersensitivity reaction, which is different from our past cognition.
As clinical experience has generally adopted predosing
treatment for patients using taxane, the incidence of
hypersensitivity reaction is low, which also suggests that
we need to understand the limitations of the FAERS data
mining method correctly.[24]
Nab-paclitaxel exhibits an increased rate of death-related
outcomes compared with paclitaxel and docetaxel, which
is another surprising discovery since nab-paclitaxel is
always considered to be a safer taxane by design.[25-27] The
safety of nab-paclitaxel should be further explored in
future clinical applications. In general, the adverse events
related to paclitaxel that clinicians are concerned about are
mainly infusion reactions because this may affect the
smooth progress of the patient’s treatment.[28] Using
premedication before taxane administration can avoid the
impact of reducing infusion-related reactions, including
hypersensitivity reactions, but there is insufﬁcient preparation for adverse events, such as bone marrow toxicity
and peripheral neuropathy.[24] Late-onset adverse events
may also cause drug withdrawal, life-threatening events,
and death, which need to be taken seriously.[29]

Although the data mining techniques showed many
advantages, they cannot solve all the problems by detecting
and analyzing adverse event signals based on spontaneous
reporting systems alone.[30] Furthermore, this study has
voidable limitations. Analysis of the FAERS database
found that the data of taxane-associated adverse events are
mainly reported in Europe and North America. However,
the taxane is widely used globally, so it is necessary to
consider whether regional data are missing.
Conclusions
Our FAERS database analysis study identiﬁed positive
signals for hypersensitivity reaction, bone marrow toxicity,
and neuropathy peripheral events associated with taxanes
in a real-world setting. The most important ﬁnding from
this study is that nab-paclitaxel showed the highest signal
in signal detection. The time to onset of nab-paclitaxelassociated adverse events was signiﬁcantly later than that
of paclitaxel and docetaxel. More research is needed in the
future to explain the safety of nab-paclitaxel for better
taxane application.
