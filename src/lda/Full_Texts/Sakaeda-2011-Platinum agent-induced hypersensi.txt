Abstract
Objective: Adverse event reports (AERs) submitted to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) were reviewed to confirm the platinum agent-associated mild, severe,
and lethal hypersensitivity reactions.
Methods: Authorized pharmacovigilance tools were used for quantitative signal detection, including the proportional reporting ratio, the reporting odds ratio, the information
component given by a Bayesian confidence propagation neural network, and the empirical Bayes geometric mean. Excess2, given by the multi-item gamma Poisson Shrinker
algorithm, was used to evaluate the effects of dexamethasone and diphenhydramine on
oxaliplatin-induced hypersensitivity reactions.
Results: Based on 1,644,220 AERs from 2004 to 2009, carboplatin and oxaliplatin proved
to cause mild, severe, and lethal hypersensitivity reactions, whereas cisplatin did not.
Dexamethasone affected oxaliplatin-induced mild hypersensitivity reactions, but had
lesser effects on severe and lethal reactions. The effects of diphenhydramine were not
confirmed.
Conclusion: The FDA’s adverse event reporting system, AERS, with optimized data
mining tools is useful to authorize potential associations between platinum agents and
hypersensitivity reactions.
Key words: adverse event, AERS, platinum agent, hypersensitivity

Introduction
The treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer has
progressed significantly over the past 20 years, and
currently the FOLFIRI or FOLFOX regimen [1-4], with

or without a targeted monoclonal antibody, is the
standard treatment [5-8], consisting of the injection of
a bolus of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), irinotecan or oxalihttp://www.medsci.org

Int. J. Med. Sci. 2011, 8
platin (L-OHP), and the infusion of 5-FU/leucovorin,
respectively. Future improvements will likely require
the incorporation of or substitution with a novel anticancer drug, personalization based on genetic profiling, or pharmacokinetically-guided administration.
Hypersensitivity reactions are a well-known
complication of the use of the platinum agents, cisplatin (CDDP) and carboplatin (CBDCA) [9-12].
L-OHP, a third-generation platinum agent, has also
been increasingly recognized to cause hypersensitivity reactions [13-16], but the incidence still varies in
reports [17-25]. It is difficult to evaluate the exact
prevalence of these reactions, presumably because
their definition is vast and pathogenic mechanisms
are still vague, but L-OHP-induced hypersensitivity
can be classified into relatively acute severe anaphylaxes and delayed mild allergic reactions [13-16]. A
reduction of the infusion rate and the administration
of steroids and/or antihistamines are used to treat
both for acute and delayed hypersensitivity reactions,
and discontinuation is strongly suggested immediately upon the development of acute reactions [13-16].
However, large-scale validation is still awaited.
In this study, adverse event reports (AERs)
submitted to the US Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) were reviewed to confirm the platinum
agent-associated mild, severe, and lethal hypersensitivity reactions. This data base relies on spontaneous
reports to the FDA generated by health professionals,
consumers, and manufacturers, and the system is referred to as the Adverse Event Reporting System
(AERS). The structure of AERS is in compliance with
international safety reporting guidance, ICH E2B.
Recently, the AERS database has been used for evaluation of safety profiles of statins [26-29], rofecoxib
[30], topical bovine thrombin [31] and infliximab [32].
Here, the effects of dexamethasone and diphenhydramine on L-OHP-induced reactions were also
evaluated to suggest a management strategy for patients with hypersensitivity reactions. The effects of
bevacizumab, often used with L-OHP, were also
evaluated.

Methods
The AERS database covers several million case
reports on adverse events. Pharmacovigilance analysis aims to search for previously unknown patterns
and automatically detect important signals, i.e.,
drug-associated adverse events, from such a large
database. Recently developed data mining tools for
pharmacovigilance have been successful at detecting
signals that could not be found by individual case
reviews and that warrant further investigation together with continuous surveillance. For this reason,

333
data mining tools are being routinely used for pharmacovigilance, supporting signal detection and decision-making at companies, regulatory agencies, and
pharmacovigilance centers [33-39]. Despite some limitations inherent to spontaneous reporting, the AERS
database is a rich resource and the data mining tools
described below provide a powerful means of identifying potential associations between drugs and adverse events.

Data sources
Input data for this study were taken from the
public release of the FDA’s AERS database, which
covers the period from the first quarter of 2004
through the end of 2009. The database consists of 7
data sets; patient demographic and administrative
information (DEMO), drug/biologic information
(DRUG), adverse events (REAC), patient outcomes
(OUTC), report sources (RPSR), drug therapy start
and end dates (THER), and indications for
use/diagnosis (INDI). The adverse events in REAC
are coded using preferred terms (PTs) in the Medical
Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) terminology.
Prior to analysis, all drug names were unified
into generic names by a text-mining approach, because AERS permits the registering of arbitrary drug
names, including trade names and abbreviations. For
the batch conversion of drug names, reliable drug
databases, e.g., FDA Orange Book, were utilized as a
dictionary. Spelling errors were detected by GNU
Aspell and carefully confirmed by working pharmacists. Furthermore, drug names which failed to receive
generic names were manually converted to proper
names. Foods, beverages, treatments (e.g. X-ray radiation), and unspecified names (e.g., beta-blockers)
were omitted for this study. Duplicated reports were
deleted according to FDA's recommendation of
adopting the most recent CASE number (as described
in one of the downloaded files, 'Asc_nts.doc' from the
web-site of the FDA AERS database), resulting in the
reduction of the number of AERs from 2,231,029 to
1,644,220.
Definition of adverse events
According to the National Cancer Institute
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events
(NCI-CTCAE) v4.0, AERs with PT10020751/
hypersensitivity in REAC were adopted as the reports
on mild hypersensitivity reactions, in which 19 lower
level terms (LLTs) were assigned in MedDRA v13.0,
including LLT10000656/acute allergic reaction,
LLT10001718/allergic
reaction,
LLT10020756/
hypersensitivity
reaction,
LLT10020759/

Int. J. Med. Sci. 2011, 8
hypersensitivity symptom, LLT10038195/red neck
syndrome, and LLT10046305/upper respiratory tract
hypersensitivity reaction (site unspecified). AERs
with PT10011906/death (with 13 LLT) or death terms
in OUTC were excluded for mild hypersensitivity
reactions. AERs with PT10002198/anaphylactic reaction were adopted as the reports on severe hypersensitivity reactions, in which 13 LLTs were assigned,
including LLT10000663/acute anaphylactic reaction
and LLT10002218/anaphylaxis. AERs both with
PT10020751, and PT10011906 or death terms in OUTC
were adopted as the reports on lethal hypersensitivity
reactions. Of note, LLT10001718/allergic reaction and
LLT10002218/anaphylaxis are assigned as allergic
reactions and anaphylaxis in the NCI-CTCAE v4.0,
respectively, and PTs in their higher levels were used
in this study.

Data mining
In pharmacovigilance analysis, data mining algorithms have been developed to
identify
drug-associated adverse events as signals that are
reported more frequently than expected by estimating
expected reporting frequencies on the basis of information on all drugs and all events in the database
[37-39]. For example, the proportional reporting ratio
(PRR) [33], the reporting odds ratio (ROR) [34], the
information component (IC) [35], and the empirical
Bayes geometric mean (EBGM) [36] are widely used,
and indeed, the PRR is currently used by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency
(MHRA), UK, the ROR by the Netherlands Pharmacovigilance Centre, the IC by the World Health Organization (WHO), and the EBGM by the FDA.
All of these algorithms extract decision rules for
signal detection and/or calculate scores to measure
the associations between drugs and adverse events
from a two-by-two frequency table of counts that involve the presence or absence of a particular drug and
a particular event occurring in case reports. These
algorithms, however, differ from one another in that
the PRR and ROR are frequentist (non-Bayesian),
whereas the IC and EBGM are Bayesian. In this section, only the scoring thresholds used in the present
study are given, and the reader is referred to review
articles for details [37-39].
For the PRR, a given drug-adverse event pair
was defined as a signal, if the event count ≥ 3, and the
PRR ≥ 2.0 with an associated chi-square value ≥ 4.0
[33], and for the ROR, if the lower bound of the 95%
two-sided confidence interval (CI) of ROR exceeded 1

334
[34]. For the IC, IC025, a criterion indicating the lower
bound of the 95% two-sided CI of the IC, was adopted, and a IC025 value exceeding 0 was defined as a
signal [35]. Lastly, for the EBGM, EB05 ≥ 2.0 was set as
a threshold for signal detection, where EB05 is interpreted as a lower one-sided 95% confidence limit of
EBGM [36].
The AERS database is also a valuable resource
for exploring drug-drug interactions. Here, we are
interested in how the co-administration of dexamethasone, diphenhydramine, and bevacizumab would
affect L-OHP-induced mild, severe, and lethal hypersensitivity reactions, although the database does
not provide the information on the timing of
co-administration. To analyze such interactions, case
reports on L-OHP were classified according to
whether they also involved one of the three drugs.
Any association among the interactions was then assessed using Excess2, a statistical index of the multi-item gamma Poisson shrinker (MGPS) algorithm
[36].

Results
AERs in which CDDP, CBDCA, or L-OHP was
the principal offending agent are summarized in Tables 1-3, and numbered 44,321, 39,653, and 33,194 of
1,644,220, respectively. Reports of mild, severe, and
lethal hypersensitivity reactions numbered 43,288,
18,225, and 2,397, respectively.
CBDCA was administered in 229 of 43,288 AERs
of mild, 72 of 18,225 AERs of severe, and 12 of 2,397
AERs of lethal hypersensitivity reactions (Table 2).
L-OHP was administered in 126, 60 and 10, respectively (Table 3). The signals were detected for CBDCA
and L-OHP by either the PRR, ROR, IC or EBGM, but
no signal was suggested for CDDP (Table 1). The
sensitivity was higher for ROR or IC, whereas lower
for EBGM.
The effects of the co-administration of dexamethasone on L-OHP-induced hypersensitivity reactions
are summarized in Table 4. The values obtained with
Excess2 were 18.66, 1.19 and -0.44, respectively, indicating that dexamethasone was more effective against
mild than severe or lethal reactions. The effects of
diphenhydramine were also examined, but no signal
was detected (data not shown). The data on the
co-administration of bevacizumab is listed in Table 5.
Values of Excess2 were 0.28, 5.38 and -5.65, respectively, and suggesting an effect of bevacizumab on
severe L-OHP-induced reactions.

hypersensitivity reactions.

Discussion
Although the exact mechanism by which platinum agents cause hypersensitivity reactions remains
unclear, the agents are thought to induce a type I response mediated by IgE, followed by the release of
histamine and cytokines, since reactions usually occur
after multiple infusions [13-16]. Recent studies have
suggested the involvement of a type IV reaction, i.e.,
T-cell-mediated production of cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-6, especially

for CDDP and CBDCA [13-16]. As far as L-OHP is
concerned, most reactions are thought to be of type I,
but reports of hemolysis and thrombocytopenia suggest a type II reaction, and chronic urticaria, joint pain
and proteinuria can be attributed to a type III reaction
[13-16]. The incidence of hypersensitivity reactions
varies in reports, and this study was conducted to
confirm the platinum agent-associated mild, severe,
and lethal hypersensitivity reactions. Here, using an
extremely large number of AERs submitted to the
FDA with authorized data mining tools, CBDCA and

http://www.medsci.org

L-OHP proved to cause mild, severe, and lethal hypersensitivity reactions, whereas CDDP did not.
Spontaneous reports of suspected adverse events
are a valuable tool. However, this database has its
limitations [37]. First, the data occasionally contain
misspelling and miswords, although the structure of
AERS is in compliance with the international safety
reporting guidance. Second, the system was started
more than 10 years ago, and reporting patterns have
changed over time. Third, the adverse events are
coded using hierarchical terms of PTs of MedDRA,
and changes in terminology over time also might affect the quality of the database. Last, there are a
number of duplicate entries in the database. To overcome problems with data quality, we manually corrected mistakes in the data entities and deleted duplicates according to FDA’s recommended method. A
long-term discussion on pharmacovigilance strategies
with large numbers of spontaneous reports resulted in
the quantitative signal detection indices PRR, ROR, IC
and EBGM. Comparisons in terms of specificity
showed that none of these indices is universally better
than the others [34, 37, 38], but EBGM is of lowest
sensitivity in this study (Tables 2, 3).
Since 1998, the FDA has been exploring the
MGPS program, which evaluates the signals for pairs
and higher-order [35]. This program is used to detect
possible synergistic interactions between drugs, i.e.,
drug-drug interaction. With an index of Excess2, the
effects of dexamethasone and diphenhydramine on
L-OHP-induced hypersensitivity reactions were
evaluated to suggest the best patient management
strategy. It was suggested that the co-administration
of dexamethasone affected mild L-OHP-induced reactions more effectively, than severe or lethal reactions (Table 4). Here, the effects of diphenhydramine
were not confirmed, but unexpectedly, it was suggested that bevacizumab affected L-OHP-induced
severe reactions. It is noted that the database does not
provide the information on the timing of
co-administration. Additionally, we do not have the
criteria, e.g., threshold value, of Excess2 to detect an
unknown drug-drug interaction, and the calibration
using many known drug-drug interactions would be
necessary.
In conclusion, AERs submitted to the FDA were
reviewed to confirm the platinum agent-associated
mild, severe, and lethal hypersensitivity reactions.
Authorized pharmacovigilance tools were used for
quantitative signal detection, and the effects of dexamethasone and diphenhydramine on L-OHP-induced
hypersensitivity reactions were also evaluated. Based
on 1,644,220 AERs from 2004 to 2009, CBDCA and
L-OHP proved to cause mild, severe, and lethal hy-

337
persensitivity reactions, whereas CDDP did not.
Dexamethasone affected L-OHP-induced mild hypersensitivity reactions, but had lesser effects on severe and lethal reactions.
