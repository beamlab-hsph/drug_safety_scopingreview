Abstract

Background and objectives: Multiple myeloma treatment with lenalidomidebased regimens is associated with risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE),
particularly during concomitant use with erythropoiesis-stimulating
agents (ESAs). The risk of VTE in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) patients
treated with lenalidomide is not well characterized and the background
risk in untreated patients is not known. This study set out to determine
the reporting rate of VTE in MDS patients on lenalidomide in the two
years of postmarketing experience in the US, and to investigate whether
there is a disproportional signal of VTE in MDS patients on lenalidomide
by screening the US FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (AERS) safety
database.
Methods: The MDS population exposed to lenalidomide was obtained from
RevAssist, the company’s proprietary restrictive distribution programme.
VTE reports were identified from the company’s postmarketing surveillance
safety database. The FDA AERS database was used for disproportionality
analysis, and signal scores computed using three algorithms: multi-item
gamma Poisson shrinker (MGPS), proportional reporting ratio (PRR), and
reporting odds ratios (ROR).
Results: A total of 7764 MDS patients were prescribed lenalidomide during
the first two years of commercial use in the US. VTE representing deep vein
thrombosis and pulmonary embolism was reported in 41 patients, a reporting
rate of 0.53%. The computed signal scores did not exceed the statistical
threshold for identification of a significant disproportional signal for VTE in
MDS reports involving use of lenalidomide without concomitant use of

ESAs. However, a disproportional signal of VTE was detected in MDS
reports where lenalidomide was concurrently used with ESAs.
Conclusions: The VTE reporting rate for MDS patients receiving lenalidomide during the first two years of postmarketing exposure was low (0.53%).
Disproportionality analysis demonstrated a statistically meaningful association of VTE with lenalidomide concomitantly used with ESAs in MDS
patients, but the association was not statistically significant when lenalidomide was used in the absence of ESAs.

Background
Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a
heterogeneous group of clonal bone marrow
disorders characterized by ineffective haematopoiesis, manifesting clinically as anaemia, neutropenia and/or thrombocytopenia of variable
severity.[1,2] The incidence of MDS has been increasing over the years and more than 10 000 new
cases of MDS are diagnosed annually in the
US.[3] Many factors have contributed to this increase in incidence, including a better recognition
and understanding of the disease, a new classification of haematological disorders by WHO, inclusion as a reportable malignancy in the US
Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results
(SEER) cancer registry in 2001, and the aging of
the population.[3,4] Until recently, the treatment
choices have been limited and consisted mainly of
supportive management. However, better understanding of the pathogenesis of MDS has resulted
in novel treatment approaches.[1] For example,
discovery of the roles of angiogenesis and cytokine abnormalities in the development of the
disease has led to the use of thalidomide, and
more recently, lenalidomide, a derivative of thalidomide, in the treatment of MDS.[1,5-10]
In the US, lenalidomide is approved for the
treatment of patients with transfusion-dependent
anaemia due to low- or intermediate-1-risk MDS
associated with a deletion 5q cytogenetic abnormality with or without additional cytogenetic
abnormalities. It is also approved in combination
with dexamethasone for the treatment of multiple
myeloma patients who have received at least one
prior therapy.

The incidence of venous thromboembolism
(VTE) in multiple myeloma patients receiving
thalidomide-based regimens varies from 1% to
43% and appears to be dependent on several
factors, including concomitant use of other
drugs.[11-22] There have also been reports suggesting that treatment of multiple myeloma
with lenalidomide-based regimens is associated
with an increased risk of VTE and that concomitant administration of erythropoiesisstimulating agents (ESAs) may further increase
that risk.[23,24] The primary risk is with lenalidomide administration (25 mg/day on days 1–21
of a 28-day cycle) in combination with high-dose
dexamethasone (40 mg/day on days 1–4, 9–12
and 17–20) without thromboprophylaxis. The
US package insert for lenalidomide includes a
‘black box’ warning describing an increased VTE
risk with a lenalidomide-dexamethasone combination. However, this risk is mitigated in patients
who receive the same lenalidomide regimen in
combination with low-dose dexamethasone
(40 mg/day on days 1, 8, 15 and 22) for a total of
four therapy cycles.[25]
Information on the background risk of VTE in
MDS patients is limited. We therefore analysed
data on VTE in MDS patients taking lenalidomide based on postmarketing surveillance safety
data and lenalidomide exposure information. In
addition, to test the robustness of findings from
the company’s postmarketing surveillance safety
database, we performed disproportionality analysis using the US FDA Adverse Event Reporting
System (AERS) database to test if a disproportional signal of VTE in MDS patients taking
lenalidomide was present.

Analysis of VTE in MDS Patients Receiving Lenalidomide

Patients and Methods
Patients and Study Design

The total number of MDS patients taking
lenalidomide was obtained from the Celgene
RevAssist programme. In brief, RevAssist is a
proprietary restrictive distribution programme
specifically tailored for patients receiving lenalidomide in the US. The programme aims at preventing fetal exposure through patient education
by healthcare providers who prescribe the drug
and pharmacies that dispense the drug. Under
RevAssist, only prescribers and pharmacists registered with the programme can prescribe and
dispense the product. In addition, lenalidomide is
dispensed only to patients who are registered and
meet all the conditions of the RevAssist programme. The number of MDS patients taking
lenalidomide for the period between 27 December
2005 and 31 December 2007 was obtained from
the Celgene Order Management Systems (COMS)
database of the RevAssist programme. The
number of MDS patients developing VTE while
taking lenalidomide during the same time period
was retrieved from the company’s postmarketing
surveillance safety database.
Cases of VTE were defined using both narrowand broad-scope terms. The narrow-scope VTE
terms were defined as adverse event reports coded
with the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory
Activities (MedDRA) preferred terms deep vein
thrombosis or pulmonary embolism. The broad definition of VTE used the standardized MedDRA
query term Embolic and thrombotic events,
venous. MDS cases were defined as any adverse
event report with an indication of MDS from
either the company postmarketing surveillance
safety database or the FDA AERS database. The
ESAs darbepoetin alfa and epoetin alfa were
grouped and collectively named as ESAs.
For computation of disproportional signal
scores of VTE, a vendor-provided commercial
version of the FDA AERS database covering the
period 1997–2007 was used. Although the AERS
database is available through the Freedom
of Information Act, the database in the public
domain has not been ‘cleaned’. The commercial

AERS data was cleaned by selecting only the
latest report for each case, excluding duplicate
cases, standardizing the original verbatim drug
names and mapping them into common generic
names, and harmonizing the adverse events into
MedDRA version 10.1 preferred terms.
Analyses by risk category were not possible
because data on MDS risk category, such as low
or intermediate-1 risk with or without a 5q deletion, was not routinely collected in either the
company proprietary safety database or the FDA
AERS database.
In order to eliminate bias from the selection
of a signal detection algorithm, three disproportionality algorithms were used to compute
signal scores on the AERS dataset: the multi-item
gamma Poisson shrinker (MGPS), the proportional reporting ratio (PRR), and the reporting
odds ratio (ROR). The MGPS method computes
adjusted reporting rates designated as Empirical
Bayesian Geometric Mean (EBGM) with 90%
confidence intervals (CIs) [EB05 and EB95]. The
PRR method computes adjusted reporting rates
supplemented with chi-square (w2) values, and the
ROR method computes adjusted odds ratios with
90% CIs (ROR05 and ROR95). All algorithms
compute disproportional scores by dividing
observed counts by expected counts for drug and
event combinations from a specific database. The
calculation of observed and expected counts in all
of these algorithms is based on the 2 · 2 contingency table (table I).
Observed counts are defined as the total
number of reports that contain a study drug and
a study event. The value ‘A’ in table I represents
the observed counts. Observed count (A) remains
the same regardless of the disproportional
algorithms selected. The calculation of expected
counts differs depending on the selection of

disproportional algorithms. The expected counts
in the MGPS algorithm are computed as (a + c) ·
(a + b)/(a + b + c + d) with an adjustment from the
unique Bayesian shrinkage mechanism depending on the size of the observed counts; the expected counts in PRR algorithm are computed as
b · (a + c)/(b + d); and the expected counts in
ROR algorithm are computed as b · c/d.
None of these algorithms has demonstrated
greater validity than the others and signal scores
generated from the three algorithms have been
presented in many publications.[26-28] However, it
has been suggested that the MGPS method
achieves better specificity, and that the PRR and
ROR methods obtain better sensitivity.[29]
Although the current analysis employed three
algorithms, PRR results are not presented here
because of their similarity to the ROR results and
the fact that they therefore do not add extra value
to the conclusions.
When computing disproportionality scores it
might be necessary to predefine a ‘custom’ drug
or event. If this is the case, then the observed and
expected counts for this custom drug and event
combination will be computed similarly by replacing the study drug with the custom drug in
the 2 · 2 contingency table.

Data Analysis

VTE reporting rates were computed as the
number of MDS patients in the company’s postmarketing surveillance safety database in whom
VTE was reported divided by the total number of
MDS patients receiving lenalidomide during the
same time period, i.e. the period between 27 December 2005 and 31 December 2007. VTE reporting rates for two age categories (<65 years
and ‡65 years) were also computed.
In this study, three predefined drug categories
from the AERS database were created:
1. MDS patients exposed to lenalidomide in the
absence of ESAs, denoted as ‘Lenalidomide
without ESAs’;
2. MDS patients exposed to ESAs in the absence
of lenalidomide, denoted as ‘ESAs without
lenalidomide’;
ª 2009 Adis Data Information BV. All rights reserved.

3. MDS patients exposed concomitantly to lenalidomide plus ESAs, denoted as ‘Lenalidomide
with ESAs’.
Signal scores for the three drug categories were
computed with the FDA AERS database covering the period 1997–2007. In this study, the results from the MGPS algorithm were considered
to have generated a disproportional signal of
VTE when EB05 was >2 and the number of VTE
cases was >2. For ROR results, a disproportional
signal of VTE was considered to be present when
the ROR was >2, the ROR05 was >1 and the
number of VTE cases was >2. Although we selected the above cutoff criteria for defining a disproportional signal, caution should be exercised
when interpreting events that generate EB05 or
ROR signal score values of <2. An event with
a disproportional signal score under the threshold could still be a signal if that event is underreported relative to other reported events. On
the other hand, an event demonstrating statistical association with a drug based on the disproportional signal score does not imply a
causal association between the drug and event
combination.
To examine whether confounding by age, sex
or year of report to the FDA have any effect on
the generated signal scores, disproportionality
analyses were performed by stratifying for these
variables. Also, because lenalidomide is a derivative of thalidomide, and both drugs might have
some adverse events in common and could be
used for the same indications, it is possible that
signals from lenalidomide could be diluted by
overwhelming signals from thalidomide, a phenomenon referred to as cloaking or masking.[30]
To rule out a possible masking effect of thalidomide on the safety profile of lenalidomide, disproportionality analyses were performed and
signal scores computed by either including or
excluding thalidomide reports from the analysed AERS database. Also excluded were AERS
reports from clinical trials since this analysis
aimed at computing disproportional signal scores
of VTE for MDS patients in the postmarketing
setting.
In addition, given that lenalidomide was
approved in December 2005, we repeated the

disproportionality analyses whilst limiting the
background to the FDA AERS data from 2006
and 2007. These analyses sought to establish
whether limiting the analyses to the period from
the time that lenalidomide was on the market
produced results that were similar to those obtained when using the entire AERS database as
background.

Venous Thromboembolism (VTE) Reporting
Rate for MDS Patients Receiving
Lenalidomide from Company Postmarketing
Database

Between 27 December 2005 and 31 December
2007, lenalidomide was dispensed to 7764 MDS
patients. Medically confirmed postmarketing VTE
reports for lenalidomide for MDS indication were
retrieved from the company’s postmarketing surveillance safety database. The demographic data
and VTE reporting rates are presented in table II.
There were 41 VTE reports if the narrow-scope
definition was applied and 65 VTE reports using
the broad-scope definition. The 41 VTE reports
based on the narrow VTE search were equally
distributed between male and female, whereas
there was a slightly increased representation of
females when the broad VTE search term was
used. The reporting rates were 0.53% and 0.84%
when using the narrow and broad search terms for
VTE reports, respectively. The majority (76%) of
VTE reports were from elderly patients.
All of the 41 VTE reports using the narrow
VTE term were reported to the company as
serious adverse events. Thirty-two of these reports were solicited through the company’s
RevAssist risk management programme and
nine originated from spontaneous reports. For
the 29 reports with available time-to-onset dates,
the median time to VTE onset was 58 days with a
range of 6–258 days. Ten VTE reports had a
positive dechallenge at the time of reporting.
There were no rechallenge results available for
any of these reports. ESAs were concomitant
medications in four of the VTE reports. One report had a history of pulmonary embolism and
deep vein thrombosis; another two reports had a

as ‘recovered’ and four as ‘not recovered’ at the
time of the report. The other 20 reports did not
provide outcomes. In addition, 12 reported use of
anticoagulant prophylaxis, including heparin (4),
warfarin (5) and aspirin [acetylsalicylic acid] (3).
Disproportional Signal Scores of VTE
Computed Using the US FDA Adverse Event
Reporting System Database

Disproportional signal scores of VTE for the
three custom-defined drug categories using FDA
AERS after exclusion of thalidomide reports and
without stratification are presented in table III.
Both the drug category ‘Lenalidomide with
ESAs’ and the category ‘ESAs without lenalidomide’ produced a disproportional signal of VTE
(with both narrow and broad VTE terms) with
the ROR algorithm and a marginal signal with
the MGPS algorithm. The drug category ‘Lenalidomide without ESAs’ did not produce a disproportional signal of VTE with any of the
algorithms.

To investigate the impact of age, sex and the
year that the reports were submitted to the FDA
on signal scores, the analysis stratified for these
three variables and the adjusted results, after exclusion of thalidomide cases, are presented in
table IV. The ROR results are shown in figure 1,
and the MGPS results are shown in figure 2.
Similar to the unadjusted results, there was no
disproportional signal of VTE for the drug category ‘Lenalidomide without ESAs’ but a disproportional signal of VTE was observed for
‘Lenalidomide with ESAs’ with ROR and a marginal signal with the MGPS algorithm. The drug
category ‘ESAs without lenalidomide’ also
showed a marginal signal on ROR. However, the
stratified signal scores were lower and the CIs
were narrower than for the unadjusted results.
The above analyses (unadjusted and adjusted)
were repeated with inclusion of thalidomide
reports. The results of the signal scores did not
differ significantly from the analyses that excluded thalidomide cases and are not shown.
To establish whether limiting the analyses to
the period after the time that lenalidomide was on
the market produced results that were similar to
using the entire AERS database as background,

and 2007 as background. The results (unadjusted

Discussion
VTE is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in cancer. In the general population, the
incidence of VTE is about 0.12%,[31] and rises
with advancing age in both sexes. Cancer patients
have a 4- to 6-fold higher risk of developing VTE
compared with non-cancer patients, with variability in VTE incidence associated with tumour
type and therapeutic regimen.[31] Cytotoxic or
immunosuppressive chemotherapy increases the
risk of developing VTE.
The occurrence of VTE in the MDS patient
population is not well characterized. A retrospective cohort analysis of 515 patients with
haematological malignancy reported a 6.5%
prevalence of deep vein thrombosis in MDS
patients.[32] It was not clear whether ESAs
were concurrently administered to these MDS
patients. A clinical study showed that the cumulative incidence of thrombotic events when thalidomide alone was administered to MDS patients
was 1.5% (2 out of a total of 137 patients).[33-35]
No ESAs were administered to these patients. In
a single-arm clinical study of lenalidomide in
Clin Drug Invest 2009; 29 (3)

Analysis of VTE in MDS Patients Receiving Lenalidomide

transfusion-dependent MDS patients with chromosome 5q deletion, the cumulative incidence of
VTE over the course of the 24-week study was
2.7%.[6] Again, no ESAs were administered in
this study.
In this analysis, the reporting rates of VTE
using the narrow and broad VTE definition terms
for MDS patients taking lenalidomide were
0.53% and 0.84%, respectively. These reporting
rates are much lower than the cumulative incidence reported in clinical studies of thalidomide
or lenalidomide. Although the VTE reporting
rate in this analysis was different from the incidence rates reported in epidemiological cohort
studies, we believe that the VTE reporting rate
reported in the current analysis was closer, but
not identical, to the true VTE incidence rate in
MDS patients taking lenalidomide. Under the
Celgene RevAssist programme, all MDS patients receiving lenalidomide are captured, which
means the denominator for calculating the VTE
reporting rate accurately represents the number
of MDS patients exposed to the drug. In other
words, if the true VTE numerator could be determined, the same denominator would be used
to compute the incidence rate. Although the
numerator used to calculate the VTE reporting rate (the number of VTE cases) derives from
the company’s postmarketing surveillance safety

167

database, under the RevAssist programme,
there is a concerted effort through contract pharmacies that are the only authorized outlets for
dispensing lenalidomide to report to the company
any adverse event regardless of relationship to
lenalidomide. Furthermore, the company, through its Risk Management Programme for lenalidomide, alerts prescribers and pharmacists about
the risk of VTE. Approximately 70% of VTE reports received by the company were through the
RevAssist-associated solicited reporting system,
i.e. not through the spontaneous route that might
be expected in a standard postmarketing surveillance programme. It is therefore reasonable to
assume that a higher proportion of VTE cases are
captured into the company’s postmarketing surveillance safety database than would be otherwise
expected in routine adverse event surveillance for
products not subject to restricted distribution.
Nonetheless, under-reporting, which is a well
known problem for spontaneous reports, would
still bias the VTE reporting rate. Thus, the VTE
reporting rate presented here, albeit originating
from a restricted distribution programme with
active participation of pharmacies and prescribers, should be interpreted within the context
of the limitations of postmarketing data.
Because the VTE incidence rates in the
MDS population with no chemotherapy or with

chemotherapy other than lenalidomide are not
accurately known, it was not possible to directly
compare the VTE incidence rates among the
general MDS population, the MDS subpopulation treated with lenalidomide, and the MDS
subpopulation treated with other supportive
MDS medications such as ESAs. To supplement
and test the robustness of findings from this
postmarketing surveillance database, disproportional signal scores of VTE for three predefined
drug categories were computed.
The disproportional analysis results consistently demonstrated a statistically meaningful
association between VTE and use of lenalidomide
concomitantly with ESAs in MDS patients, but
the association was not statistically significant
when lenalidomide was used in the absence of
ESAs. Development of VTE in MDS patients
taking lenalidomide in the absence of ESAs has
not been a serious issue.[6,10,33-36] However, the
possibility of publication bias leading to selective
VTE over-reporting of lenalidomide in the presence of ESAs cannot be excluded given that there
have been reports describing a possible interaction.[23,24] A recent finding showed that use of
ESAs for the treatment of cancer-associated
anaemia is linked to an increased risk of VTE.[37]

Also, in an MDS trial involving use of thalidomide, the parent compound of lenalidomide, in
combination with darbepoetin alfa, three of the
first seven enrolled patients developed VTE.[10]
Our findings are consistent with these observations. However, further clinical studies are needed
to characterize the clinical significance of these
findings.
In this analysis, we also investigated variables
that could affect disproportionality signal scores.
First, we demonstrated that the potential masking effect of thalidomide on the signal scores
of lenalidomide is limited as the results computed
with and without thalidomide led to the same
conclusions. Also, we demonstrated that for a
newly marketed product such as lenalidomide
it is probably not worthwhile selecting the
entire AERS database to calculate signal scores.
Limiting the background data to the relevant
years covered by the period since the drug’s introduction on the market appears sufficient to
compute signal scores. The expansion of the
search terms to include more terms in the search
category also did not offer additional advantage as the results based on the narrow and
broad VTE search categories were similar. In
our analyses, we observed that appropriate

stratification stabilized signal scores by narrowing the CIs.
However, there are limitations associated with
the approach used in this study. Disproportional analysis techniques evaluate the association between drugs and adverse events, and are
not intended to assess the causal relationship between drugs and events. In addition, the disproportional results were obtained from the
FDA AERS database, which is a collection of
spontaneous reports. Like any other spontaneous
databases, under-reporting of adverse events is of
concern. Furthermore, consideration should be
given to the fact that although VTE is common in
cancer patients, it does present diagnostic challenges.[38] Therefore cases of VTE might go undetected, which results in fewer reports of VTE in
the pharmacovigilance database and hence an
underestimation of the reporting rate.
To the best of our knowledge, this is one of
the first analyses that utilizes computation of
disproportional signal scores based on predefined
‘custom’ drugs under a specific indication. Although this approach offers distinct advantages
in undertaking disproportionality analyses, the
possibility of misclassification of indications for

drugs in the FDA database cannot be excluded,
and this could skew the significance of our findings. Another limitation of the study is related to
interpretation of the ROR, PRR and MGPS results in this analysis. It is generally recognized
that none of these algorithms has greater validity
over the other. However, frequentist data mining
algorithms (PRR and ROR) generate more signals than Bayesian-based algorithms such as the
MGPS.[28,30] A recent study has demonstrated
that only about 30% of ROR signals are identified as MGPS signals.[39]
Conclusion
This study has demonstrated a low VTE reporting rate (0.53%) for MDS patients receiving
lenalidomide during the first two years of postmarketing exposure. Disproportionality signal
scores computed from the FDA AERS safety
database showed statistically meaningful associations of VTE when lenalidomide was concomitantly used with erythropoeisis-stimulating
agents (ESAs). The computation of disproportionality signal scores from a large database based on predefined ‘custom’ drugs is an
