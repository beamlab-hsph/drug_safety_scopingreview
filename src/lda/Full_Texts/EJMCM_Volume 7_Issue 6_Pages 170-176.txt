Abstract: The drug discovery process needs long time and cost to discover proper drug for
treating the patients effectively. The unintended effects of drugs and the beneficial impact
of drugs must be recognized because they may inflict severe patient’s injuries due to
unforeseen acts of the produced candidate drugs. One of the effective techniques is text
mining it can find the hidden relation between genes, diseases and drugs from the huge
volume of data. Predict drug Indications and Side effects using TOpic modeling and
Natural language processing (PISTON) was a text mining method which used to find the
association between drug-disease and drug-side effects. Natural Language Processing
(NLP) is used to identify words which relate association among drugs and genes from the
sentences which are collected from literatures where words represent drugs and genes cooccurred. The relation between drugs and genes is represented through building drug-topic
probability matrix by topic modeling. From the drug-topic probability matrix, the drugs for
phenotypes can be identified by training a classifier for high-rank topics of drugs. It also
predicted the association between drug and side effects. However, expressive power of
named entities and their potential for enhancing the quality of discovered topics has not
received much attention in PISTON. So in this paper, an Improved PISTON (IPISTON) is
proposed which enhance the quality of discovered topics through named entity recognition
system and inducing the syntactic structure from unannotated sentences. Initially, the
sentences from the collected literature data are extracted and a dependency graph is
constructed using NLP. After that, a Gene Regulation Score (GRS) of each sentence is
calculated to define the relationship between gene and diseases. The topic modeling is
enhanced by finding the biomedical entities in the biomedical repository using Conditional
Random Field (CRF) and Bi-directional Long-Short Term Memory-CRF (BLSTM-CRF).
CRF is a sequence modeling framework which finds the biomedical entities through the
conditional probability distributions of biomedical entities on collected documents.
BLSTM-CRF is a deep learning technique which is used to enhance the performance of
CRF based named entity recognition. Moreover, the syntactic structure of sentences is
calculated through syntactic distance measure. The syntactic structure, biomedical entities
and the drug-topic probability matrix is given as input to CRF, BLSTM-CRF, Naïve Bayes,
CART and Logistic for prediction of drug-phenotype and drug-side effects associations.

1. INTRODUCTION
The interdisciplinary scientific area of medicinal science combines numerous areas of science
and engineering, aiming at finding a new drug. Drug [1] may be regarded as molecules
communicating with an appropriate target protein in order to disturb various biological
interaction networks, for particular the signal transduction network, the metabolic pathway
and the network for protein interaction. Drugs are utilized for infectious prevention and
management to protect and improve safety. Drug discovery [2] is a more complicated process
to define and possible goals for drugs. Most of the drug discovery is failed, due to the project
failure and drug development cost. Nearly, all drugs have an affect so unexpected signs (i.e.,
side effects) may hurt and have serious consequences. So, it is more necessary to find the side
effects for reducing the sever effects.
The extreme consequences are minimized by drug repositioning [3]. The significance of drug
repositioning has risen significantly as the expense of new drug development has increased
drastically. This also decreases time and expense for drug development. Various methods has
been developed for drug repositioning according to the computational methods was proposed
because of the exponential increase in available phenotypic or genomic data and the
appearance of various methods for data analysis including machine learning and text mining.
Text mining [4] is used to extract useful knowledge from high dimensional unstructured text
data. Text mining works easier when using secondary data resources in order to help predict
harmful outcomes as correct drug guidance leads to increased protection of drugs works
reliable.
A text mining model called PISTON [5] for predicting the relation between drug-phenotype
and drug-side effects pairs. Initially, sentences from literature where drugs and genes cooccurred were collected. After that, a dependency graph was constructed using Natural
Language Processing (NLP). A Gene Regulation Score (GRS) was calculated to recognize
the outcome of the drug on gene regulation. According to the topic modeling, grouped the
regulatory relationships between genes and drugs which are often co-occur were grouped into
one topic and drug-topic matrix was constructed through probability calculation of each drug
occurred under various topics. Finally, a classifier was developed and learned from the of
identified phenotype-drug-side effects matrix to predict unknown associations among
phenotype-drug-side effects. However, expressive power of named entities and their potential
for enhancing the quality of discovered topics has not received much attention in PISTON.
In this paper, the named entities is used as domain-specific terms for biomedical text content
and classifiers such as Conditional Random Field (CRF) and Bi-directional Long-Short Term
Memory (BLSTM-CRF) are used for named entity recognition. The recognition of named
entities supports the topic modeling to provide high precision topics for disease, drug, gene
and side effects. Furthermore, syntactic structure is induced from unannotated sentences in
the biomedical context and leverages the inferred structure to learn a better language model.
A syntactic distance is calculated between the topic and words to find the syntactic structure.
It is given as additional input to the classifiers such as CRF, BLSTM-CRF, Naïve Bayes,
Classification and Regression Tree (CART) and Logistic to predict the drug-phenotye and
drug-side effect association effectively. This whole work is named as Improved PISTON
(IPISTON).

2. LITERATURE SURVEY
A semi-supervised graph cut algorithm and three layer data integration [6] were proposed to
predict the drug-disease interactions. The heterogeneous data were integrated into three layers
based on the hierarchical fashion. Here, a novel weighted drug-disease pair network was built
where a node was act as drug-disease pair which was weighted with the similarity score
between two pairs. Then, the similar drug-disease pairs were was obtained to find an optimal
graph cut of the network. The drug-disease pair with unknown relation was considered to
have similar diagnosis relation within the same cut. However, multiple sources of data were
not fused properly and reasonably.
A hybrid machine learning method [7] was proposed to predict the drug side effects
according to the appropriate dataset features. In this method, data analytic techniques were
employed to analysis the impact of drug distribution in the feature space and categorizing
side effects based on the distribution of classes. Finally, domain-dependent strategies for each
type were adopted to build the data models. However, this method finds difficult to predict
the complex side effects.
A machine learning algorithm [8] was proposed for prediction of drugs side effects. The drug
side effect prediction process was started with clustering the drugs with respect to the feature
profiles using K-mean, Partitioning Around Medoids (PAM) and K-seeds techniques.
Bayesian method has been used for each cluster to measure the matrix of probability score in
which each dimension contains the score for indicating the probability of particular side
effects for a drug belonging to the same cluster. However, the convergence speed of the
clustering algorithm depends on the initial clusters.
A large-scale similarity-based framework [9] was presented to predict the interaction between
drugs. A drug-related data and its knowledge were semantically combined that returned a
knowledge graph. It described the drug attributes and its relationship with other associated
objects including chemical structures, pathways and enzymes. The different similarity
measures between all the drugs were computed in a scalable and distributed framework with
the aid of knowledge graph. The resulting similarity metrics were used to develop features for
a large-scale logistic regression model to predict the interactions between drugs. However,
the logistic regression model was difficult to capture complex relationships.
An optimized drug similarity framework [10] was proposed to enhance the performance of
side effect prediction. The process of this framework was started with combining four various
drug similarities as the comprehensive similarity and fine tuned by clustering. After that, the
optimized similarity was improved by the indirect drug similarity to predict the side effects of
drugs. However, it has low F1-score.
A computational method [11] was proposed to predict the side effects in drugs based on the
features of determined available drug and association between side effects and drugs.
Computational method developed in low-dimensional space, which extracted features of side
effects and drugs. This method was differs from the traditional conventional matrix
factorization approach, and can found the biomedical context into account. The matrix
factorization was an efficient technique, and determined the undetermined relationship
according to the known association-based matrix. However, it does not predict the association
between drug and side effects in the SIDER database.
A binary classification model [12] was proposed to predict the drug side effects through
heterogeneous information of drugs. In order to encode the each drug-side effects, similarity

based method was applied. Also, random forest was adapted to predict the drug side effects.
It was considered that the drug has side effects when the prediction outcome was positive and
wise versa. However, this model not possible to detect the side effect in early stage.
A Network Topological Similarity-based Classification (NTSIM-C) [13] method was
proposed to predict the relationship between drug and disease. In NTSIM-C, relationship
between drug and disease was defined as a feature vector. It consisted of similarity scores
between drugs and the other drugs and the vector related to the row vector in drug-drug
similarity matrix. A linear neighborhood similarity matrix was constructed for drugs and the
linear neighborhood similarity matrix was calculated for a disease. A vector was created for
the relationship between the disease and the drug. The vector combined the similarity vector
of both drug and disease. The relationship between disease and drug was predicted based on
the vector. However, this method is not applicable for large datasets.
3. PROPOSED METHODOLOGY
In this section, the proposed Improved PISTON (IPISTON) is described in detail for
prediction of drug-phenotype association and drug-side effect association.
Initially, the sentences are collected where drugs and genes are co-occurred. Then, a word
dependency graph was built using Natural Language Processing (NLP) for every sentence.
The identified words that represent connections between drug and genes are used to find side
effects of drugs based on gene regulation. A Gene Regulation Score (GRS) of sentences are
computed from the words occurred in the sentences that indicates up and down regulation of
genes. The up and down regulation represented by words are identified by comparing these
words with the gene keyword dictionary. GRS of a drug-gene pair in a sentence is calculated
as,

computed for the sentences those are not containing words represents up or down
(
) represents score of sentences as +1 for having more number
regulation. The
of up-regulation words,-1 for having more number of up-regulation words.
The optimal number of topics is required to build a drug-topic matrix that is determined using
log-likelihood. The named entities and GRS are used as features in the drug-probability
matrix and construct a matrix using genes that affects drugs and their regulatory relationship
based on topic modeling. The drug-topic probability matrix is constructed by grouping genes
and their regulatory association that co-occur frequently from all drugs into optimal number
of topics. Then, the genes of each drug with their regulatory association are compared with
the genes in optimal number of topics and computed the probability that the drug contained
the topic.
3.1 Topic Modeling and named entity recognition
The document collected from the literature comprises of words related with drugs and
several topics about drugs. The individual topics comprises of words for representing gene,
phenotypes, drugs and side effects. In this paper, each document refers a drug; the topic
refers set of similar genes and their regulatory relationships and the word refers a gene.

The recognition of named entities in the biomedical repository supports the topic modeling to
provide more accurate topics for drug-phenotype and drug-side effect association. CRF and
BLSTM-CRF are used for named entity recognition.
a) CRF based named entity recognition
For building probabilistic models, CRF is a sequence modeling framework, conditional
probability distributions on an undirected graph model. A linear-chain CRF is applied for
named entity recognition. The conditional probability of linear chain CRF determined on
observation (i.e., document) and a random variable (i.e., biomedical entities) as follows:

parameters are approximated by cross-entropy
computed from training data.
b) Bi-directional LSTM-CRF based named entity recognition
A deep learning technique is applied to enhance the performance of named entity recognition.
The bidirectional BLSTM-CRF consists of input layer for getting inputs, hidden layer for
feature weight updating, CRF layer and output layer for classifcation. The input feature is a
word vector that was extracted from sentences of each document. The extracted words are
converted in to a vector representation by a word embedding method BioASQ [14].
The output layer provides the label for entity which relates to drug, phenotype or side effects
with probability values. Named entity recognition start with little quantity of physically
interpreted corpus and after that construct a classifier learned with the annotated corpus. The
constructed classifier then analyzes and provides the label for unlabeled data. The prediction
results are included to the training data for the retraining of classifier for further predictions.
Thus the performance of the classifier progressively increased by re-training with the
machine-labeled corpus and manfully labeled data. The named entity recognition is trained
by using back propagation method and the dropout rate for learning from training data is
fixed as 0.5. The basic structure of BLSTM-CRF is depicted in Figure 3.2.

3.2 Inducing syntactic structure from unannotated document
Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) is used to induce the syntactic structure from unannotated
document and leverage the inferred structure to learn a better language model. The syntactic
structure is modeled by using stick-breaking process. It calculates the probability distribution
between topics and genes. LSTM is a kind of recurrent neural network which effectively
handle the sequential data. In LSTM, the current hidden state depends on the last hidden
state. The hidden state holds the syntactic structure of the unannotated document for the last
time step. However, it suffers from ignoring the real dependency relation that dominates the
structure of genes. A skip-connection is used to integrate structure dependency relation with
LSTM. By integrating the structure dependency relation with LSTM, the current hidden state
depends on the last hidden state, earlier hidden states which have a syntactic relation to the
current one. The skip connections are controlled by gates. It is defined by introducing a latent
variable to denote local structural context of document :

The location of the left most child belonging to the left most sibling
is
while the left most child of a subtree is .

The location of ’s left most sibling is
while the left most child of any
subtree is not . The gates are represented by,
{

(3.3)

By using this structure, the sibling dependency relation is replicated by at least one skipconnect. Through the skip-connect relation between the nodes, the parent-to-child relation
will be implicitly modeled. The following Eq. (3.4) shows the model newly updates the
hidden states.

A soft gating vector is used to approximate Eq. (3.4) and (3.5) with the above relaxations for
updating the hidden state (syntactic structure). A hypothesis is considered to parameterize .
In the hypothesis, it is considered that genes which are co-occur frequently in all drugs should
have a closer syntactic relation within themselves, and that this syntactical proximity can be
denoted by scalar value. A syntactic distance is introduced to model the syntactical
proximity. A set of real valued scalar variables

the syntactic relation between the genes which are frequently co-occur in all drugs and the

to the differences between distances. The values of syntactic
distance have more conceptual definition. If two adjacent genes are peers of each other, the
syntactic difference should be around zero; whereas if they belong to different sub-trees, they
should have a greater syntactic distance. In the worst scenario, the syntactic distance is closer
to 1 if the two genes do not have a subtree in general. The drug-topic matrix is concatenated
with syntactic distance and it is given as input to the classifiers such as CRF, BLSTM-CRF,
Naïve Bayes, CART and Logistic for prediction of drug-phenotype and drug-side effects
associations. The classifiers are trained using known drug-phenotype and drug-side effect
associations which are collected from CTD and SIDER respectively.

In this section, the efficiency of PISTON and IPISTON are tested in terms of accuracy,
sensitivity, specificity and z-score. For the experimental purpose, PubMed, DrugBank,
KEGG DRUG and PharmGKB datasets are used. PubMed is a database which provides
biology literature and it collects 1,454,763 abstracts from 6975 journals. The official names
of the drugs are collected from DrugBank to find the names of drugs in sentences. DrugBank
provides comprehensive drug data in cheminformatics and bioinformatics. KEGG provides
for approved drugs in U.S., Japan and Europe. From the DrugBank, the official names of
2196 approved drugs are obtained and their synonyms are collected from KEGG DRUG.
PharmGKB is a database that provides information on genetic variation in drug responses.
26,886 gene symbols are obtained from PharmGKB database. The drug-side effect

Figure.4.7 Comparison of Z-score for phenotypes
Figure 4.7 shows the comparison of z-score of PISTON and IPISTON for prediction of drugphenotype association with different classifiers. X axis denotes the drug-phenotype
association prediction methods and Y axis denotes the z-score. The z-score of IPISTON is
5.93% greater than PISTON for logistic classifier. From the Figure 4.7, it is proved that the
proposed IPISTON has high z-score than PISTON for drug-phenotype association with CRF,
BLSTM-CRF, CART, Naïve Bayes and logistic classifiers.

Figure.4.8 Comparison of Z-score for side effects
Figure 4.8 shows the comparison of z-score of PISTON and IPISTON for prediction of drugside effects association with different classifiers. X axis denotes the drug- side effects
association prediction methods and Y axis denotes the z-score. The z-score of IPISTON is
5.13% greater than PISTON for logistic classifier. From the Figure 4.8, it is proved that the
proposed IPISTON has high z-score than PISTON for drug-side effects association with
CRF, BLSTM-CRF, CART, Naïve Bayes and logistic classifiers.
5. CONCLUSION
In this paper, an IPISTON is proposed for prediction of drug-phenotype and drug-side effect
association using text mining techniques. Initially, data related to drug, gene and side effects
are collected from biomedical repository. Then, the sentences in the collected document are
extracted and a dependency graph is constructed using NLP. A GRS is calculated for each
sentence to find the effect of the drug on gene regulation. In the collected documents, the
topics are modeled and then the biomedical entities are determined using CRF and BLSTMCRF which enhance the quality of topic modeling. The syntactic distance between the topic
and words are computed which refines the syntactic structure of the sentences. The syntactic
distance and drug-topic probability matrix are given as input to the CRF, BLSTM-CRF,
Naïve Bayes, CART and Logistic to predict the drug-phenotye and drug-side effect
association effectively. The experimental results prove that the proposed IPISTON has better
accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and z-score than PISTON for prediction of drug-phenotype
and drug-side effect associations.
