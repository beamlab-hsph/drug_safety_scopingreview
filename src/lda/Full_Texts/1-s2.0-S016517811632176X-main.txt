Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have become one of the most broadly used medications in psychiatry. Fluoxetine is the ﬁrst representative antidepressant SSRI drug approved by the Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) in 1987. Safety information on ﬂuoxetine use alone was less reported than its combined
use with other drugs. There were no published papers on adverse drug reactions (ADRs) of ﬂuoxetine analyzing
spontaneous adverse events reports. We detected signals of the adverse drug reactions of ﬂuoxetine by data
mining using the Korea Adverse Events Reporting System (KAERS) database. We deﬁned signals in this study by
the reporting odds ratios (ROR), proportional reporting ratios (PRR), and information components (IC) indices.
The KAERS database included 860,224 AE reports, among which 866 reports contained ﬂuoxetine. We compared
the labels of ﬂuoxetine among the United States, UK, Germany, France, China, and Korea. Some of the signals,
including emotional lability, myositis, spinal stenosis, paradoxical drug reaction, drug dependence, extrapyramidal disorder, adrenal insuﬃciency, and intracranial hemorrhage, were not labeled in the six countries. In
conclusion, we identiﬁed new signals that were not known at the time of market approval. However, certain
factors should be required for signal evaluation, such as clinical signiﬁcance, preventability, and causality of the
detected signals.

1. Introduction
The World Health Organization (WHO) deﬁned depression as a
common mental disorder, such as loss of pleasure, disturbed sleep, low
self-worth, and poor concentration. In the United States, the percentage
of persons receiving mental health care and using antidepressants has
been on the increase annually. From 1990–1992, the percentage was
12.2%, increasing to 20.1% by 2001–2003 (Kessler et al., 2005; Olfson
and Marcus, 2009). The monthly rate of antidepressant use was 2.5%
from 1988 to 1994 and 8.1% from 1999 to 2001 (Olfson and Marcus,
2009; Paulose‐Ram et al., 2007). The data from the Health Insurance
Review and Assessment Service (HIRA) indicated that the cost of using
antidepressants in 2014 increased 22% compared to that in 2010 in
Korea.
Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have become one of
the most broadly used medications in psychiatry. The reason for the
increased use of SSRIs is their favorable record on safety and their
broad range of therapeutic eﬀect on anxiety disorders (Lane, 2001).
Fluoxetine was the ﬁrst representative antidepressant SSRI drug approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1987. Fluoxetine
⁎

is also the lowest reuptake inhibitor of serotonin relative to noradrenaline among SSRIs (Bolden-Watson and Richelson, 1993; Tatsumi
et al., 1997).
Spontaneous adverse event reporting system has been in eﬀect in
Korea since 1988. Physicians, pharmacists, and patients are required to
report any potential adverse drug reactions to the Ministry of Food and
Drug Safety directly or via the Regional Pharmacovigilance Centers
(Choi and Park, 2007). Many countries in Europe, the United States,
and Asian countries including Korea, Japan, China, and India run
spontaneous adverse event reporting system and routinely search signals of adverse drug reactions from the reported adverse events database. These data have been utilized to produce evidence for making
eﬀective policies on the safe use of drugs (Regal, 2004; Shalviri et al.,
2007). The data-mining techniques are used for searching unexpected
associations or hidden patterns through computerized algorithms in
extensive databases (Waller et al., 1996). This process is widely utilized
for retrieving signals in spontaneous adverse event reporting systems. A
recent study used a data-mining technique in our laboratory for detecting the signals of amoxicillin was published, which proved the effectiveness of the data-mining technique (Soukavong et al., 2016).

S. Kim et al.

The deﬁnition of an adverse drug reaction (ADR) is any response to
a drug that is unintended and noxious. The deﬁnition of a signal is
reported information with a possible causality between a drug and an
adverse event (AE) (Egberts et al., 2002). Fluoxetine was classiﬁed as a
‘C grade’ drug on safety during pregnancy by the US FDA. The risk of
developing three or more minor anomalies was increased in infants
exposed to ﬂuoxetine during pregnancy, and the risk of perinatal
complication was also increased among women exposed ﬂuoxetine in
the late stage of pregnancy (Chambers et al., 1996). Safety information
on ﬂuoxetine alone was less reported than the combined use of ﬂuoxetine with other drugs. There were no published papers on adverse drug
reactions (ADRs) of ﬂuoxetine through analyzing spontaneous adverse
events reports.
The purpose of our study was to detect signals of ﬂuoxetine ADRs
from Korean patients with depression and to compare the labels of
ﬂuoxetine among the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany,
France, China, and Korea.

2.1. Database and study drug
We used information on the reported adverse event cases related to
ﬂuoxetine from the Korea Adverse Events Reporting System (KAERS)
database. The KAERS is a reporting system developed by the Korea
Institute of Drug Safety and Risk Management (KIDS) to receive and
manage adverse event (AE) reports. The spontaneous AE reporting
system was ﬁrst initiated in 1988 by the Korea Food and Drug
Administration (KFDA), and spontaneous AE reports have been collected since then. The KIDS developed the computerized AE reporting
system. KAERS, in 2012, which is now covering voluntary reporting
from the general public and healthcare professionals as well as mandatory reporting by manufacturers for unintended and serious events
using a standardized reporting form.
This database has included information on ADR code, serious ADR
case, suspected drug information, reporter, and causality assessment
information. The causality assessment information was not used in this
study because it could reﬂect the subjective judgment of the reporter.
All drug names are coded using the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical
Classiﬁcation System (ATC Code), and ADRs are coded by the Preferred
Terms (PTs) among the WHO Adverse Reaction Terminology (WHOART). Serious ADR information is referred if any ADR resulted in death,
a life-threatening situation, a patient requiring prolonged hospitalization, a persistent or signiﬁcant disability/impairment, or congenital
defects/anomalies, or other medically important conditions deﬁned by
the KIDS. Unexpected signal is deﬁned as any signal which was not
listed in the drug label information for all six countries. Serious unexpected signal is deﬁned as any signal inputted as serious ADR information but not listed in the drug label information for all six countries.
A total of 860,224 reports have been accumulated from December
1988 to December 2015 in the KAERS database, which included
3,012,517 events. More than one AE and more than one drug can be
included in one AE report, which can result in more than one adverse
event-drug pair per each report. In the present study, we chose ﬂuoxetine as the study drug. We decided to use three comparison groups: all
other SSRIs, all other antidepressants, and all other drugs.

and Table 2). Of these approaches, ROR is used by the Netherlands
Pharmacovigilance Centre, Lareb, which is driven by a 2×2 contingency table on the same calculation principle (Evans et al., 2001).
The PRR is the index of the reporting rate of one speciﬁc AE among all
events for a given drug, as the comparator for all drugs reporting rates
in the database. The ROR is the odds ratio of one speciﬁc AE reporting
versus all other events for a given drug compared to the odds for all
other drugs in the database (Egberts et al., 2002). A signal is considered
meaningful when the lower limit of the 95% conﬁdence interval (CI) of
the ROR is greater than one (van Puijenbroek et al., 2002). ICs are used
as the signal metric in the BCPNN. If a drug and an adverse event are
statistically independent, the ratio of the mutual probability of drug and
event [P(AE, Drug)] to the product of the individual probabilities [P
(AE)P(Drug)] will correspond to one and the IC will correspond to zero
(Table 2). Using the logarithm of the ratio is based on information
theory.
In this study, the adverse event that was detected by all the three
indices ROR, PRR, and IC was deﬁned as a signal. Signals were detected

2.2. Statistical analysis
Measurement of disproportionality is one of the statistical techniques to detect signals of ADR. Both Frequentist and Bayesian methods
are used to calculate disproportionality by using reporting odds ratios
(ROR), proportional reporting ratios (PRR), and Bayesian conﬁdence
propagation neural networks (BCPNN) of information components (IC)
(Bate et al., 1998; Evans et al., 2001; Rothman et al., 2004) (see Table 1

3. Results
Table 3 presents the number of AE reports by ﬂuoxetine, other
SSRIs, other antidepressants, and all other drugs from 1988 to 2015.
The total number of reports was 3,012,517 from all drugs and 866 from
ﬂuoxetine. It was obvious that the total number of AE reports by antidepressants increased each year. Table 4 showed frequently reported
AEs associated with ﬂuoxetine. Insomnia was the most frequently reported AE (44, 5.08%), followed by anorexia (38, 4.39%), dizziness (35,
4.04%), somnolence (33, 3.81%), and headache (31, 3.58%).
Among the 866 reports attributed to ﬂuoxetine, 556 (64.20%) were
from females, and 280 (32.33%) were from males. The most frequently
reported type was spontaneous reports (391, 45.15%), followed by
survey research (225, 25.98%), literature (98, 11.32%), and others
(152, 17.55%). The most frequently reporting people were physicians
(307, 35.45%), followed by pharmacists (97, 11.20%), nurses (65,
7.51%), customers (143, 16.51%), and others (67, 7.74%). The most
frequent reporting sources were manufacturing or importing companies
(536, 61.89%) followed by regional pharmacovigilance centers (242,
27.94%), consumers (54, 6.24%), medical centers (29, 3.35%), pharmacies (4, 0.46%), and health centers (1, 0.12%).

through disproportionality analysis. We used System-Organ Class (SOC)
among WHO-ART to group ADRs (Table 5). Statistical analyses were
performed by Microsoft EXCEL 2010 and SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc.,
Cary, NC). We compared detected signals with the labels of ﬂuoxetine
among the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, France, China,
and Korea.

3.1. Signals of ﬂuoxetine compared with all other SSRIs
We detected 23 signals compared with all other SSRIs. Emotional
lability, myositis, spinal stenosis, paradoxical drug reaction, psychosis,
bullous eruption, and drug dependence were detected as unexpected
signals that were not labeled in the United States, UK, Germany, France,
China, and Korea. Emotional lability, myositis, spinal stenosis, bullous
eruption, drug dependence were detected as serious and unexpected
signals in drug labels in the United States, UK, Germany, France, China,
and Korea (Table 5).

2.3. Ethics statement
Since the study used secondary healthcare data, it was exempted
from review by the Institutional Review Board of Seoul National
University College of Medicine and Seoul National University Hospital

depletion of platelet aggregation and vasoconstriction (Gahr et al.,
2015). In observational studies, an association between SSRI and intracranial hemorrhage was not conﬁrmed due to the small number of
intracranial hemorrhage events; however, brain hemorrhage risk was
increased (De Abajo et al., 2000; Hackam and Mrkobrada, 2012). SSRIs
were reported to increase the brain hemorrhage risk based on metaanalysis (Hackam and Mrkobrada, 2012). Case reports showed correlations between ﬂuoxetine and extrapyramidal symptoms, such as those
in Parkinson's disease, hypertonia, and dystonia. The elderly were
particularly susceptible to unexpected extrapyramidal symptoms because of greater use of concomitant medications, increased physical
frailty, and interactions with other treatments compared with younger
people (Govoni et al., 2001).
Compared with previous research, our study has several strengths.
First, we used all the spontaneous adverse event reports from December

bullous eruption, drug dependence were not included in the drug labels
of the six countries.
According to the deﬁnition of signal, the causal relationship between a signal and a drug is incomplete or unknown (World Health
Organization, 2004). We cannot be sure of a temporal relationship
between medication intake time and occurrence of ADR, such as emotional lability, paradoxical drug reaction, psychosis, neurosis, increased
appetite, depression, spinal stenosis, or increased CRP. Depression may
result from psychoneuroimmunological dysfunction, and depression
can be responsible for high CRP levels (Cepeda et al., 2016; Elovainio
et al., 2009).
Hemorrhage can be associated with SSRIs’ ADRs. Serotonin is
known to be involved in platelet aggregation. Platelets capture serotonin used by neurons from circulation (Lesch et al., 1993). SSRIs,
including ﬂuoxetine, block serotonin reuptake, which can cause a

1988 to December 2015 from whole Korea, which could guarantee
representativeness of whole Korean population. Second, our study
compared the labels of ﬂuoxetine market approval documents in six
countries, including South Korea. We could not include Japan because
ﬂuoxetine was not approved in Japan. Third, we added serious ADR
information that could severely threaten public health. Fourth, our
study detected signals of ﬂuoxetine compared with other SSRIs, other
antidepressants, and all other drugs to conﬁrm comparability.
Comparing the results of the three groups, the detected signals showed
substantial diﬀerences, which depended on the level of comparability.
The therapeutic class eﬀect can explain the substantial diﬀerences in
detecting diﬀerent signals using the diﬀerent comparison groups.
However, our study has also several limitations. The ﬁrst one is that
AEs are generally underreported to the spontaneous AE reporting
system. Many factors for underreporting are noted. These include ignorance that led to selective reporting of severe ADRs (95%) and difﬁdence in suspected ADRs (72%) (Lopez-Gonzalez et al., 2009). Although the opinions and knowledge of healthcare professionals are
important determinants of spontaneous reporting, it is less likely that
the unknown AEs are reported actively (Lopez-Gonzalez et al., 2009).
Underreporting could decrease the sensitivity of detecting ADRs, which
results in underestimating the frequency and impact of ADRs. AE reports could also have the potential for overreporting. As already mentioned, all potential drugs which were suspected to induce adverse drug
reaction could be reported. Second, this study is insuﬃcient in evaluating causal relationship because it is a kind of descriptive study applying data-mining technique to an adverse events database. Further
pharmacoepidemiological studies for evaluating causal relationship
between a signal and a suspected drug should be conducted, such as
cohort studies, case-control studies, or case-crossover studies (Bate and
Evans, 2009). Third, as this study analyzed AE data of Korean people,
we have to consider the possibility of ethnic diﬀerences. Therefore
further pharmacoepidemiologic studies to evaluate the possibility of
ethnic diﬀerence should be conducted. Nevertheless, our study is the
ﬁrst attempt to identify ﬂuoxetine signals using the KAERS database, a
nationwide source of information on drug safety. In pharmacovigilance,
early detection of clinically meaningful signals is very important for
protecting patients from ADRs.
In conclusion, we identiﬁed several new signals that were not
known at the time of market approval. Extrapyramidal disorder, hypertonia, dystonia, and brain hemorrhage can be regarded as having a
possible causal relationship based on existing case reports and several
hypotheses that were steadily proposed about ﬂuoxetine and other
SSRIs. Therefore, well-designed pharmacoepidemiological studies
should be conducted for signal evaluation, including clinical signiﬁcance, preventability, and causal association.
