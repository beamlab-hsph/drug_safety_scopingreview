Abstract
Background: The detection of signals of adverse drug events (ADEs) has increased because of the use of data mining
algorithms in spontaneous reporting systems (SRSs). However, different data mining algorithms have different traits and
conditions for application. The objective of our study was to explore the application of association rule (AR) mining in ADE
signal detection and to compare its performance with that of other algorithms.
Methodology/Principal Findings: Monte Carlo simulation was applied to generate drug-ADE reports randomly according
to the characteristics of SRS datasets. Thousand simulated datasets were mined by AR and other algorithms. On average,
108,337 reports were generated by the Monte Carlo simulation. Based on the predefined criterion that 10% of the drug-ADE
combinations were true signals, with RR equaling to 10, 4.9, 1.5, and 1.2, AR detected, on average, 284 suspected
associations with a minimum support of 3 and a minimum lift of 1.2. The area under the receiver operating characteristic
(ROC) curve of the AR was 0.788, which was equivalent to that shown for other algorithms. Additionally, AR was applied to
reports submitted to the Shanghai SRS in 2009. Five hundred seventy combinations were detected using AR from 24,297
SRS reports, and they were compared with recognized ADEs identified by clinical experts and various other sources.
Conclusions/Significance: AR appears to be an effective method for ADE signal detection, both in simulated and real SRS
datasets. The limitations of this method exposed in our study, i.e., a non-uniform thresholds setting and redundant rules,
require further research.

In these regards, automatic filtering data mining methods are
considered to provide efficient assistance for the surveillance of
drug safety. The proportional reporting ratio (PRR), the adjusted
PRR (adjPRR), and the reporting odds ratio (ROR) have been
used by the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory
Agency (MHRA) and other ADE monitoring centers [2–3]. The
Bayesian confidence propagation neural network (BCPNN) has
been used by the Uppsala Monitoring Centre (UMC) [4–5].
Additionally, the United States Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) has applied Multi-item Gamma Poisson Shrinker (MGPS)
for data mining of large frequency tables [6–7]. However, it should
be noted that each method has its deficiencies. For example, for
the ROR and PRR, the odds ratio and standard error cannot be
calculated if the denominator is zero (i.e., specific ADEs did not
occur). For the BCPNN, relatively non-transparent Bayesian
statistics, issues relating to multiple comparisons, and a lower
sensitivity are inevitable [7–8]. Most of these algorithms
mentioned above used in SRSs are based on disproportional

Introduction
Pharmacovigilance (PhV) is defined as ‘‘the science and
activities relating to the detection, assessment, understanding,
and prevention of adverse effects or any other drug-related
problems’’ [1]. Because of the limitations of animal studies and
clinical trials, the post-marketing safety surveillance of drugs could
be crucial for PhV. The major datasets used in the post-marketing
safety surveillance of drugs are derived from spontaneous
reporting systems (SRSs), which are a proxy for the true
population. Nowadays there are a large number of adverse drug
events (ADEs) are reported in China. The number reached
638,996 until 2009 and has been increasing yearly. It is
challenging for pharmacological experts to efficiently identify
associated drug-ADE reports from such large datasets without data
mining tools. Therefore, there is an urgent need for effective signal
detection methods.

analysis in 2-dimensional contingency tables (Table 1). With these
algorithms, the disproportional reports are found as signals, by
comparing adverse events of people taking specific drugs with
those taking other drugs. However, the accuracies of other
disproportional methods for detecting ADE signals depend, to a
large extent, on the number of suspected drug reports. If there are
few reports, the accuracy of signal detection is greatly reduced [9].
Therefore, we proposed the use of association rule (AR) mining,
which searches for frequent item-sets (specific drugs and ADEs
that frequently appear at the same time) without being influenced
by reports. Before our study, Harpaz et al. [10] employed AR to
detect multi-item ADE associations (drugs-ADE, drug-ADEs, and
drugs-ADEs) in the FDA’s adverse effect reporting system (AERS),
and their results suggested it to be a valid approach. In our study,
we compared the ability of AR with that of other recognized
methods to detect 2-item associations (drug-ADE) using simulations and demonstrated its application.

Methods
accomplishes the procedure of removing parts of the redundant
rules. Because we mainly focused on the ‘‘drug R ADE’’ in our
study, we then filtered the rules by template matching, choosing
the rules in the order of drugs to ADEs by coding the SAS
program to ensure that the antecedent of the rules were drug items
and the subsequent were ADE items. Pruning rules were also
employed to keep only 2-item association rules, when multi-item
rules were removed. Finally, suspected 2-item ‘‘drug-ADE’’
association rules were obtained.

AR Mining
AR mining, put forward by Agrawal et al. in 1993, searches for
interesting relationships among items in a given dataset [11]. ARs
were expressed in the form of A?B, the 2 items (antecedent A and
subsequent B) being from the same dataset, with A\B~1. In
other words, AR provides information in the form of an ‘‘if-then’’
statement. In the surveillance of ADEs, suspected drug-ADE
combinations, such as ‘‘drug?ADE’’ are evaluated. For example,
‘‘thalidomide R deformities’’ means that if pregnant women take
thalidomide, severe birth deformities may occur in their infants.
The strength of an AR is expressed mainly by support,
confidence, and lift. The percentage of events that contain A
and B among all the events, denoted as P(A|B), called the
support, and this expresses how often the items in a rule are
present together. Higher support indicates that the rule, which in
this case is the combination of drugs and ADEs, has occurred
more frequently and should be detected more easily. The
percentage of events including A and B among all events including
A, denoted as P(BDA), is called the confidence. The confidence
provides an estimate for the conditional probability of B given A
and is employed to determine the reliability of the rule [12].
Another important parameter in AR, i.e., the lift, is expressed as
P(BDA)
P(B) . If the lift of the rule is greater than 1, it means the A and B
in the same rule are dependent on each other, and the larger the
lift, the stronger the association between A and B.
Based on the 3 parameters above, the procedure for the AR
algorithm has 2 steps. Firstly, all the rules with their ‘‘support’’
values being greater than the predefined minimum support
(Min_sup) value will remain as frequent item-sets. Secondly, by
selecting item-sets whose confidence and lift are both greater than
the predefined minimum confidence (Min_conf) and minimum lift
(Min_lift) among frequent item-sets generated in the first step, AR

Simulation Study [13–14]
In this study, we focused on the signal detection of single drugADE combinations in simulation data using ROR, PRR, BCPNN,
MHRA, and AR, with the BCPNN method being chosen as a
representative of the Bayesian methods. Firstly, simulation datasets
were generated according to the statistical characteristics of real
datasets in SRSs. The SRS model was proposed in the study of
Roux [13]. During a given period, the number of reports that are
assumed under a Poisson distribution is defined as follows:
d~e:i:RR:pr
where e, i, RR, and pr are the drug exposure frequency, ADE
background incidence, relative risk, and reporting probability,
respectively. We arbitrarily considered 40 drugs and 60 ADEs
(2,400 drug-ADE combinations) to form simulation data. The 2
exposure frequencies of the drugs (e) used were 300,000 and
30,000, and each was assigned to half of the drugs. The
background incidences (i) were 1/200 and 1/500, again each
was associated to half of the ADEs. Half of the ADEs were serious
and half were mild. In terms of the drug launch duration, we chose
3 different durations: 1, 5, and 10 years, to distribute the dataset.
Therefore, the reporting probabilities (pr) were defined as 0.095,
0.080, 0.055, 0.030, and 0.010, according to the different drug
launch durations and the severities of the ADEs. Only 10% of the
drug-ADE combinations were true signals, with RRs of 10, 4.9,
1.5 and 1.2; the remaining 90% were assumed to be coincidental
with RRs of 1.
For the common methods, the reports generated from the
simulations were transformed to ‘‘a b c d’’ in a 2-dimensional
contingency table for signal detection. AR also required transformation of the data before it could be executed: the frequency ‘‘a’’
of the specific drug-ADE combination needed to be split into
signal reports. Before implementing AR to detect suspected

signals, it is necessary to establish some criteria to prune redundant
rules. According to the MHRA, there should be at least 3 reports
for a suspected drug-ADE combination [3,15], thus we predefined
the value of the Min_sup count to be 3. In terms of the Min_lift
threshold, different studies have set different values according to
their datasets and requirements. Harpaz et al. [10] defined the RR
threshold, equivalent to the Min_lift in our study, as 2. Therefore,
the Min_lift should at least be greater than 1. In addition, because
we only focused on the condition of a single drug causing a single
ADE in this study, the items should be 2 in a rule [16]. The
‘‘confidence’’ did not seem to be an appropriate parameter to
include for signal detection, since it was possible for rare adverse
events to have a low confidence despite being strongly associated
with certain drugs [10].

Results
Simulation Study
Thousand simulation datasets with 60 drugs and 40 ADEs were
generated, and the average number of drug-ADE combinations
was 108,337 with a standard deviation (SD) of 168. Because of the
error associated with the simulation, 237 (SD = 1.7) signals were
produced on average.
At the start, a large number of rules were generated by the AR.
Because we mainly focused on the rules in the order of drugs R
ADEs, the rules were filtered by template matching to assure that
the antecedent of the rules were drug items and the subsequent
were ADE items. Predefined signals were considered to be the gold
standard by the simulation. By comparing the ability of the signal
detection with 7 different Min_lifts, we found when Min_lift was
1.2, with a Min_sup of 3, the Youden’s index was optimum
(Table 2). We therefore defined the rules whose lift was greater
than 1.2 and support was greater than 3 to be suspected signals.
The detection criteria of the ROR, PRR, BCPNN, and MHRA
have been applied in many empirical studies [2–7]. Table 3 shows
the results of 5 algorithms after running 1000 simulated datasets.
Compared with the predefined real signals, the average numbers
of combinations detected by ROR, PRR, BCPNN, and MHRA
were all less than 200, but AR generated 284 suspected
combinations.
Moreover, because of ROR, PRR, and MHRA with the same
theory, we compared the receiver operating characteristic (ROC)
of MHRA and BCPNN with that for AR. The ROC was drawn
with combinations that appeared more than or equal to 3 times by
SPSS18.0, and the results are presented in Figure 1. As shown in
Figure 1 and Table 4, each area under the ROC curve (AUC) is
larger than 0.75 (P,0.001), and AR has the same AUC as
BCPNN, which is larger than that for MHRA.

Application Study
To demonstrate the capability of AR in real-life data sets, we
collected reports submitted to the SRS of the Shanghai ADE
Monitoring Centre in 2009. Recognized ADEs were identified by
clinical/pharmacological experts, the literature, dispensatories and
ADE information bulletins from the National Center for ADE
Monitoring. Our SRS was similar to WHO Adverse Events
Reporting System (AERS). Personal information was not involved
in our dataset, and individual identify codes in SRS were marked
with random numbers. The study was approved by the Ethics
Committee of the Second Military Medical University, Shanghai,
China. In our study, all algorithms, as well as the Monte Carlo
simulation, were implemented using the software SAS 9.1.3.

Application Study

The generic names of drugs were standardized and coded
according to the catalogue of generic names for common
prescription drugs issued by the Ministry of Health of China.
ADE names were coded with the WHO adverse drug reaction
terminology (WHO-ART) using preferred terms (PT) [17–18].
Similarly, according to items = 2, we focused on combinations of
drug-ADE instead of drug-ADE-ADE, drug-drug-ADE, etc. As in
our simulation study, the thresholds of Min_sup and Min_lift were
set at 3 and 1.2, respectively, and template matching and pruning
rules were also employed. On the basis of the advice of clinical
experts, the literature, and ADE information bulletins by the
National Center for ADE Monitoring, the results of the data
mining by AR were evaluated.

After the data was cleaned, there were a total of 24,297 reports
from January to December in the 2009 Shanghai SRS dataset and
1512 generic drug names and 805 ADE items were generated by
standardization. Insignificant reports were then deleted, for
example reports when the drug was only physiological saline or

glucose. Finally, a total of 570 suspected drug-ADE associations
were generated by AR. By decreasing the lift, we found that 10%
of the associations were the most suspected, with lifts greater than
100. Lifts between 10 and 100 were secondary suspected
associations, accounting for 29.5% of the associations, and

associations with lifts between 1.2 and 10 accounted for 60.5% by
template matching. Among the 570 drug-ADE rules, most of the
associations had been referred from dispensatories or relational
references; the others were infrequent. Table 5 shows 10 typical
suspected drug-ADE combinations among the associations
detected by AR.
According to the results in Table 5, some well-known examples,
such as ‘‘aspirin R gastric ulcer bleeding’’ [19], were selected to
check whether they could be detected by AR. The results showed
that AR detected the well-established ‘‘aspirin R gastric ulcer
bleeding’’ association. There were 16 reports of this combination
and the lift value was greater than 100, thus it was considered one
of the most suspected associations at the front of mining results.
Nevertheless, some suspected combinations, which were unfamiliar to people, were detected, such as ‘‘simvastatin R myalgia’’.
Among the 9 reports of this combination, there were 3 strongly
associated with high creatine phosphokinase, and 1 report
combined with rhabdomyolysis. All of the reports confirmed that
adverse myalgia was related to the administration of simvastatin,
as reported previously [20–21]. In addition, these associations in
table 5 were also supported by the ADE information bulletins from
the National Center for ADE Monitoring produced between 2010
and 2011.

setting their threshold values, by virtue of the size of the dataset,
subjectivity was the main limitation. In our study, we selected a
Min_lift of 1.2 according the largest Youden’s index. Ordonez
[16] agreed that a Min_lift of 1.2 would generate primarily
predictive rules. Furthermore, we clearly showed (Table 3 and
Figure 1) that AR was more sensitive than the other algorithms.
Further, there were many false-positives that were difficult to
avoid. If we raised the Min_lift and Min_sup to reduce the falsepositives, the false-negatives would increase. Because of the
absence of recognized settings for the Min_lift and Min_sup,
these values should be set rationally according to the following
conditions: if detecting as many ADE signals as possible is the
primary goal, the Min_lift should be set at higher than but nearer
to 1; on the contrary, if eliminating non-association is the primary
task, the Min_lift should be set higher. In addition, plenty of
redundant rules were inescapable in the process of mining large
datasets. The percentages of redundant rules were 84.12% and
87.46% in the simulation and application studies, respectively.
Fortunately, a variety of improved methods has been proposed
recently [22–24]. In our study, template matching and the
threshold settings for the support and lift were the main pruning
approaches used in signal detection.
Although simulation datasets cannot reflect real-world situations
and all conditions exactly, they are still a good alternative to
compare the signal detection ability of methods under conditions
without a gold standard. It would also be critical for the algorithms
to work well in real-world situations. As we can see from our study,
the data quality of SRSs seems to be of utmost importance. The
authenticity and integrity of datasets tremendously influence the
reliability and accuracy of statistical results. In our study, we did a
lot of work to improve the quality of the 2009 Shanghai SRS
datasets, for example, deleting duplicated reports, standardizing
the denominations of the drugs and adverse events, and coding the
drugs and adverse events. However, the limitations of SRSs are
still inevitable. To mirror the situation more accurately, physicians
and nurses should pay closer attention to the details in case of
under-reporting [25]. Additionally, the background incidence of
the ADE in the whole population and the number of patients
exposed to the drug are still unknown, and these are the inherent
defects of SRSs [26]. There are a number of factors that can
distort the real causal relationship of a drug-ADE association,
therefore controlling and assessing these factors are key issues that
are worthy of concern at present.
Considering several challenges of SRSs and data mining
algorithms, there is still much work to do. In particular, improving
AR and other algorithms to assure the accuracy of signals detected
in SRSs will be the focus of our future work.

Discussion
AR has already been validated as an effective method for the
initial identification of multi-item ADEs in other studies (e.g.,
Harpaz et al. [10]). However, because there is no gold standard
regarding the statistical methods that should be used in order to
facilitate accurate ADE signal screening and previous studies had
not included any comparison of AR to other methods, we designed
a simulation study for comparing AR with other methods.
According to the predefined standards, we found that AR
efficiently detected suspected drug-ADE combinations with the
parameters of lift, support, and confidence. It detected associations
among drug-ADE combinations on the basis of item frequencies
and its performance was similar to the commonly used methods.
In the real SRSs dataset, AR detected both familiar and unfamiliar
combinations, including ‘‘aspirin R gastric ulcer bleeding’’ and
‘‘simvastatin R myalgia’’, most of which appeared with strong
associations. These combinations detected by AR were consistent
with clinical evidence, case analyses, and ADE bulletins from 2010
to 2011, which validated its use for detecting suspected ADE
signals in a timely fashion, thus playing an important role in safety
surveillance. ADE signal detection is a process that explores the
association between a specific drug and the ADE it may cause. In
fact, data mining only generates interesting information regarding
the data, and this kind of relationship cannot be considered causal.
To be precise, data mining plays a part as a decision support tool,
rather than as a decision maker. Therefore, statistical methods
based on the execution of computer programs are not a panacea in
studying drug safety; large-scale pharmacoepidemiological investigations and pharmacological research are still necessary for the
assessment of signals before any definite conclusions can be drawn.
Our study also revealed some challenges that can be attributed
to both the method and quality of the data. Support and lift were
the main parameters of the AR. Since there were no criteria for
