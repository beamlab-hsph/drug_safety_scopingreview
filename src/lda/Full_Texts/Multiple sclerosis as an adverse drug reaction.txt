ARTICLE HISTORY

ABSTRACT

Background: Possible relationship between drug exposure and multiple sclerosis (MS) development is
insufficiently investigated, and further challenged by the incomplete understanding of MS etiopathogenesis. The study aims to investigate whether drug exposure could contribute to MS, by analyzing
worldwide spontaneous reporting archives of adverse drug reaction (ADRs).
Research design and methods: We retrieved information from the US Food and Drug Administration
Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) over a 13-year period. Reporting odds ratio (ROR) for MS was
calculated for each single substance. Disproportionality signals were considered when at least 10 cases
were retrieved with a lower limit of the 95% confidence interval (CI) >1.
Results: After a customized data-mining process, 3,226 reports of MS were retrieved. ‘Antineoplastic
and immunomodulating drugs’ (33% of total reports) were the most frequently reported, with 10
disproportionality signals, including etanercept (445 cases; ROR: 2.48; 95% Cl: 2.24–2.74), adalimumab
(329; 2.05; 1.83–2.30), and infliximab (119; 2.25; 1.87–2.70). We also observed signals for drugs acting on
hormone balance, bone density, and central nervous system.
Conclusion: Our findings suggest that immunomodulatory drugs increase the risk of MS and point out
that some other drug classes should be further investigated for this risk.

1. Introduction
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a degenerative disease of central nervous
system affecting over 2 million individuals worldwide and represents a leading cause of disability in young adults. Several risk
factors have been associated with MS development, including
Epstein–Barr virus infection, tobacco smoking, genetic variants,
and low serum vitamin D levels [1]. The etiology of the disease is
still not fully understood, although immune system dysregulation
and inflammation have a crucial role.
An additional knowledge gap regards the possible role of
exposure to certain drugs on risk of MS: two recent systematic
reviews have highlighted that some drugs may protect from
MS development (e.g. contraceptives), while agents such as
immunomodulators acting on tumor necrosis factor (TNF) may
increase the disease risk. However, the low quality of previous
studies (mainly case reports) and conflicting data from observational designs call for real-world pharmacovigilance analyses [2,3].
The Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event
Reporting System (FAERS) represents a valuable source to
timely detect postmarketing adverse drug reactions (ADRs).

Because of its role in collecting voluntary reports of suspected
ADRs, FAERS is frequently used to study serious short latency
ADRs [4], although different studies have demonstrated its
potential exploitation to investigate late-onset ADRs, including
cancer [5] and demyelinating events [6]. Signals from spontaneous reporting systems represent an opportunity to detect
exposures suggestive of adverse events and could contribute
to insights into pathophysiological pathways leading up to the
disease.
The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether MS
could be a possible ADR by investigating disproportionality
signals of MS after drug exposure and to identify how FAERS
could contribute to study multifactorial and delayed diseases.

2. Material and methods
2.1. Pharmacovigilance database
Voluntary reporting of suspected ADRs is a global activity
under specific regulatory rules, not only requested to health
professionals, but also mandatory for drug companies and
feasible for consumers. Permanent collection and analysis of

relevant reports is mandatory for both national and international medicines agencies.
FAERS is a freely available database that contains over 8
million of reports, which allows for detection and characterization of pharmacovigilance signals for newly marketed
agents and rare events. It includes different datasets linked
by unique identifier numbers to describe each reported case:
DEMO (collects demographic and administrative information
for each report), DRUG (drug information and their suspected
role in ADR), REACTION (information about specific ADR),
OUTCOME (severity of ADR and consequences), REPORT
SOURCE (who reported ADR), THERAPY (drug therapy details),
and INDICATION (therapeutic indication).
FAERS data recorded between 1 January 2004 and 30 June
2016 were downloaded from the relevant website (https://www.
fda.gov/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/
Surveillance/AdverseDrugEffects/) and processed for data cleaning (i.e. elimination of duplicates and multiple records) [7].
Reported drugs were mapped according to substance name
and anatomical therapeutic chemical (ATC) codes; the ATC
code is an alphanumeric codex based on chemical, pharmacological, and therapeutic proprieties of substance (https://www.
whocc.no/atc_ddd_index/). Since several different roles can be
hypothesized by the submitter for each reported drug, only
those indicated as primary and secondary suspect drugs (PS
and SS in role code field) were considered for the main analysis.
Both ADRs and therapeutic indication were mapped and classified by using Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities
(MedDRA), a recognized hierarchical medical terminology used
in pharmacovigilance (https://www.meddra.org/).

While these strategies may decrease confounding by indication, many different drugs are still being used by patients with
MS [11], especially to manage symptoms of the disease, and
the indication of use could be frequently missing. Therefore,
for each single drug, we also calculated a ‘cleaning index’ that
indicates the proportion of records that remained after the
application of the two previous cleaning steps. High cleaning
index indicates low frequency of use of a specific drug in
patients with MS and consequently a low rate of exclusion
by applying our criteria. This information was considered in
the prioritization of disproportionality signals (see below
“Statistical analysis”).
Since vaccines can represent a debated risk modifier for
demyelinating disease, and their role should be appropriately
addressed by other pharmacoepidemiological approaches,
records including vaccines among exposures were excluded.

2.3. Statistical analysis
The ROR was calculated for ATC V level (single substances) and
disproportionality signals were defined by a lower limit of 95%
confidence interval (95% CI) above 1 for substance with at
least 10 cases and a high cleaning index (at least 70%).
Statistical analyses were performed using PostgreSQL version 10.1.

2.4. Ethics statement
FAERS contains anonymous and openly data. Submission and
approval of the study by the Institutional Review Board was
not required.

2.2. Methods of analysis
Disproportionality analysis is a validated method for early
signal detection after marketing authorization. It is based on
the identification of drug–event combinations that are disproportionately highly represented in the ADR database and it
can be obtained by calculating the reporting odds ratio (ROR)
[8]. ROR compares a specific drug with all other drugs, by
considering the relevant ratios between cases and noncases,
as represented by all other reports than the event of interest.
For this study, cases are represented by reports containing the
words ‘*multiple sclerosis*’ in the preferred term (PT) reported
in the REACTION field.
In order to minimize confounding by indication (i.e. when
MS is the reason for drug use) [9,10], the following exclusion
criteria were applied to the FAERS records:
● Presence of at least one drug with unique indication for

MS, according to Summary of Product Characteristics
(ATC: L04AC01: daclizumab, N07XX10: laquinimod,
L03AB13: peginterferon beta-1a, L01DB07: mitoxantrone,
L03AX13: glatiramer acetate, N07XX09: dimethyl fumarate, L04AA34: alemtuzumab, L04AA31: teriflunomide,
N07XX07: fampridine, L04AA27: fingolimod hydrochoride, L04AA23: natalizumab, L03AB008: interferon beta1b and L03AB07: interferon beta-1a).
● Presence of at least one drug explicitly used for *multiple
sclerosis* (i.e. as reported in the field ‘IndiPT’).

3. Results
The FAERS database includes 8,238,509 spontaneous ADRs in the
13-year period used in our study. After data management, the final
database contained 5,202,124 records: 3,226 cases and 5,198,898
noncases (Figure 1). Cases were most frequently females (72%)
aged 30–65 (49%). Sixty-four percent of cases were from United
States and submitted by patients or physicians (74%); 83%
reported only one agent as a possible cause of ADR (Table 1).
Table 2 shows drugs with disproportionality signals.
Immunomodulating agents were the most frequently reported
drugs (1,343 cases). Etanercept (ROR: 2.48; 95% Cl: 2.24–2.74),
adalimumab (2.05; 1.83–2.30), infliximab (2.25; 1.87–2.70),
methotrexate (1.87; 1.36–2.56), ustekinumab (4.97; 3.57–6.90),
and abatacept (3.78; 2.65–5.39) showed disproportionality signal based each on more than 30 cases. Details on all drugs
with at least 10 cases are presented in Table S1 (supplementary material).
We found also several disproportionality signals for other
drugs. According to the 95% CI lower limit of ROR, high values
were found for eletriptan (7.60; 4.08–14.16), caffeine (4.05;
2.24–7.33), esomeprazole (3.17; 2.54–3.96), varenicline (2.05:
1.64–2.56), alendronic acid (2.56; 1.93–3.38) and its sodium
salt (2.63; 1.56–4.45), etonorgestrel (2.20; 1.64–2.94), omalizumab (2.11; 1.37–3.24), sildenafil (1.87; 1.28–2.73), and octreotide (2.01; 1.23–3.29).

As for the application of the ‘cleaning index,’ we excluded
18 drugs with at least 10 cases and a significant ROR from the

Cleaning index (see methods for details); banalysis restricted to female group ROR:
1.68 (1.23 – 2.29); canalysis restricted to male group ROR: 4.18 (2.82 – 6.19).

For the first time, we systematically explored the worldwide
FAERS database over a 13-year period to assess whether MS
could be an adverse event from drug exposure, and gained
insight into reporting pattern of MS in an unselected population. Taken together, our data suggest that the increased MS
reporting for antineoplastic and immunomodulators is likely
to have a drug-related component. In fact, these drugs share
an immunosuppressant mechanism and some of these (e.g.
infliximab, etanercept, and adalimumab) have already been
suggested to play a role in MS [2]. We add substantial weight
to previous findings generated from case reports, clinical trials,
and a population-based study, suggesting that TNF inhibitors
increase MS risk [12–18]. There is some evidence, although
weak, that certain drugs (e.g. agents used for gastrointestinal
disorders and endocrine and rheumatoid disease) contribute
to the development of autoimmune diseases (e.g. autoimmune thyroiditis, autoimmune hepatitis, and autoimmune
hemolytic anemia) [19,20], which are usually reversible with

872

I. C. ANTONAZZO ET AL.

drug withdrawal. Further, use of monoclonal antibodies has
been associated with higher risk of demyelinating autoimmune diseases, such as MS [21]. From a pathophysiological
point of view, dysregulation of the immune system is crucial
for MS development, and drugs acting on the immune system,
such as TNF inhibitors, which upregulate T-cell function and
influence the cytokine profile, may therefore contribute to
trigger demyelinating processes [3,22]. The signal emerging
for interferon α could not be easily interpreted since its analog
interferon β is traditionally used as a therapeutic option for MS
patients. As a matter of fact, they act on different immunological pathways and indeed they are used for different indications (viral infections vs. autoimmune disease); moreover,
interferon α has already been suspected to cause reversible
bilateral optical neuropathy [23].
In the light of the complex scenario described above, several reasons for our findings could be hypothesized. For certain drugs, a direct drug-related effect can be suggested (i.e.
the agent may trigger per se MS development). In other cases,
the drug is only a marker/proxy of disease, which may be
associated with MS development. This last circumstance
could occur either in the case of a common pathophysiological pathway between MS and the other disease or if the other
disease would be an actual triggering factor for MS. It should
be recognized that some of the aforementioned drugs acting
on immune system were previously tested as possible therapeutic options for MS treatment (e.g. ustekinumab [24] and
abatacept[25]). However, the lack of relevant positive results
reinforces the hypothesis that these agents are unlikely to
have a therapeutic role in MS, but instead may have a detrimental effect.
The age of the reported cases is an additional clue on the
possible role of drugs; in fact, MS is usually diagnosed
between 18 and 40 years old, whereas in our analysis, the
majority of cases were older. The delay in MS occurrence adds
weight to the hypothesis that drug may have a role in MS
pathogenesis.
As for insulin, it could be considered as a marker of disease
(type 1 and late stage of type 2 diabetes) potentially associated with MS: two previous studies hypothesized a bidirectional relationship between diabetes and MS based on
observations of an increased risk of diabetes in patients with
MS and vice versa [26,27]. Despite the distinct characteristics of
each disease, they share some risk factors, suggesting that a
common pathogenesis cannot be excluded [28,29].
The development of MS after exposure to antibiotics is an
area with conflicting evidence, as both a positive and a negative association has been reported in previous studies [30,31].
The disproportionality signal of levofloxacin may be explained
by this drug being a proxy of the actual risk factor, i.e. bacterial infection, which could itself impair the immune system,
with the consequent increase of MS risk. Moreover, antibiotics
could lead to dysregulation of the gut microbiome, which
recently has been suggested to have a role in MS [32]. In our
analysis, no antibiotics other than levofloxacin generated disproportionality signal. However, it should be noted that our
source of data are probably suboptimal for detecting delayed
effects of drugs used for short cycles, and therefore resulting
in strong underreporting, due to little awareness among

reporters on a possible link between previous drug exposure
and adverse events.
Our results suggest that use of progestins could be associated with MS risk, whereas no available evidence already
exist in the literature. Results of the ongoing POPART’MUS
study, which deals with possible effects of high doses of
progestins on MS activity in the postpartum period [33], will
provide useful findings to verify this possible association. As
regards estrogens, which are frequently administered in association to progestins, available studies, with different populations and relevant exposure, provided conflicting results on
their role in MS risk [2]. Frequent relapse episodes in MS
patients have been observed during contraceptive pill-free
period [34], and these drugs might thus be erroneously
reported in FAERS as possible cause of disease activity.
A notable unexpected signal is represented by bisphosphonates, which are largely used to prevent bone fractures in
patients with osteoporosis [35]. In a previous study, bisphosphonates showed an effect on myeloid cell maturation and
function [36], but no data are available on T and B cells, which
are likely to have an important role in MS pathogenesis. From
a clinical point of view, it should be recognized that an
increased incidence of osteoporosis has been observed in
MS patients [37] and that MS and osteoporosis share geographical distribution and several risk factors, such as smoking,
low vitamin D levels, and female sex [38]. However, the potential influence of low estrogen levels during menopause should
not be neglected when discussing a possible association
between bisphosphonates and MS. Apart from the existence
of these still unclear evidence, longitudinal studies defining
the temporal sequence of occurrence of MS, osteoporosis, and
bisphosphonate exposure should be planned.
As for the remaining signals, there is no substantial evidence to suppose specific mechanistic explanations. Some of
these drugs (e.g. esomeprazole) are commonly used in the
general population, sometimes for indications without solid
evidence base (e.g. dyspepsia); a suggested increased risk of
MS should therefore promptly be assessed by ad hoc studies,
which could clarify whether these drugs have a role in MS
development.
This study has several strengths. The database contains
over 8 million of cases worldwide, which allowed us to assess
ADRs not previously addressed in clinical trials, by analyzing
highly updated open data. Moreover, in order to minimize
false-positive signals, we used a highly specific approach for
the case definition: only MS cases than any early demyelinating events (that would not necessary lead to MS onset) were
considered. We also developed ad hoc criteria to further
increase the specificity of our method (i.e. exclusion of MS
drugs or drugs used for MS symptoms, as well as the application of cleaning index). Finally, we restricted the criteria to
define the signal by using a threshold of 10 cases, thus
increasing the minimum requirement of four cases usually
adopted in pharmacovigilance [39].
Our study has also some limitations. First, as any pharmacovigilance study, it can only identify disproportionality signals, providing researchers and regulators with drug–event
pairs to be prioritized in the assessment of actual association.
Signals should not, therefore, be interpreted as established

EXPERT OPINION ON DRUG SAFETY

risks. Moreover, the large spontaneous reporting databases
are affected by suboptimal quality of some reports (e.g. misspelling and missing data), which do not allow an accurate
case-by-case causality assessment. Although we cannot
exclude the persistence of potential uncontrolled reporting
bias, we have tried to minimize major sources of confounders
(e.g. confounding by indication); moreover, Weber effect
(increased number of ADRs usually observed during the first
2–3 years of new marketed drug) [40] is a minor issue considering that all drugs in the analysis have a long marketing
life. On the other hand, it is likely that there is a considerable
under-reporting of ADRs, since drugs are often undervalued as
risk factors for MS.

5. Conclusion
This study adds weight to the evidence that immunomodulating agents may contribute to the development of MS. For
drugs with signal of MS and weak evidence on a possible
role in MS of underlying disease (as for instance bisphosphonates and antibiotics), longitudinal studies defining the temporal sequence of occurrence of MS, underlying disease, and
drug exposure could provide useful data. For all other drugs
with a signal, population-based studies assessing MS incidence in exposed individuals should be conducted.
Our pharmacovigilance approach, which accounts for
cleaning index, higher threshold of cases, and significant
ROR, allows to minimize ‘false-positive’ signals and could be
applied to address signal detection on other multifactorial
disorders, including early demyelinating events.
As a general recommendation to increase evidence on
this topic, we encourage physicians to report as precisely as
possible all comorbidities and therapies taken by patient
when a drug is suspected to influence the onset or worsening of MS, in order to increase transferability of pharmacovigilance findings in clinical practice for long-latency
disorders.
