One of the main objectives in pharmacovigilance is the detection of adverse drug events (ADEs) through mining of healthcare
databases, such as electronic health records or administrative claims data. Although different approaches have been shown
to be of great value, research is still focusing on the enhancement of signal detection to gain efficiency in further assessment
and follow-up. We applied similarity-based modeling techniques, using 2D and 3D molecular structure, ADE, target, and ATC
(anatomical therapeutic chemical) similarity measures, to the candidate associations selected previously in a medicationwide association study for four ADE outcomes. Our results showed an improvement in the precision when we ranked the
subset of ADE candidates using similarity scorings. This method is simple, useful to strengthen or prioritize signals generated
from healthcare databases, and facilitates ADE detection through the identification of the most similar drugs for which ADE
information is available.

The detection of adverse drug events (ADEs) is a major challenge in pharmacovigilance. With the explosion of electronic
data, there has been an increase of availability of different
data sources, such as the electronic health records1 or administrative claims data,2 that have supplemented the existing
US Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting
System3 of voluntary reports. Analysis of these healthcare
databases provides potential opportunity to detect and control the impact of potential adverse effects in the population.
However, signal detection methods are still a great challenge
in the drug safety scientific community.
Different methodologies have been developed to infer
safety signals in healthcare databases between drugs and
potential adverse events that merit further investigation.4,5
Although encouraging results in ADE detection have been
reported for some methods,6 some challenges and limitations
remain most prominent among which is controlling for potential confounding factors.5,7 In fact, the class of approaches taking into account cofounding effects showed better predictive
results in an assessment of different signal-detection algorithms in US Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event
Reporting System.8 Some approaches, such as multiple
logistic regression, could be helpful to control cofounding for
co-medications in spontaneous reporting systems.9,10 Other
data sources, such as large-scale observational healthcare
data, also provide important information for drug safety, but
it is still necessary to determine suitable statistical methods
for its analysis.11–14 As an example, disproportionality methods, commonly used in the analysis of spontaneous reports,
showed poor performance using observational healthcare
data.15 However, self-controlled cohort methods showed
potential for risk identification in observational databases.16
Integration of different sources of information, such as electronic health records and medical literature, is an option that

can offer good results in the generation of improved surveillance systems.17–19
The results obtained by our group in a previous medicationwide association study using an observational healthcare
database, the Truven MarketScan Commercial Claims and
Encounters (CCAE) database,2 showed that most of the signals
generated from four clinically important ADE outcomes were
positive controls.12,20 However, we observed some statistical
associations with values above two statistical thresholds, P <
0.05 and P < 0.0005 (Bonferroni correction), between the ADEs
and medications not known to be culpable (false ­positives). Our
previous system,20 although capable of generating an enriched
subset of ADE candidates, showed some limitations in its ability
to exclude some false positives from the final signal selection.
Other studies using other data algorithms and data sources
showed the potential to provide an enriched set of drug candidates that can cause the ADE.21,22 However, improvement in
the precision in this enriched set of candidates was achieved
through the application of 2D structural similarity.21,22
We propose here a complementary method which is based
on similarity modeling to rank the subset of ADE candidates
generated through self-controlled case series (SCCS) data
analysis. Our aim is to improve the precision of the technique
in different top candidate positions and consequently provide an efficient way to prioritize signals. Figure 1 shows the
­general steps in the development of our analysis.

Table 1 shows sensitivity, specificity, and precision for

P values and relative risk (RR) to rank all the drugs in each
reference standard. AUROCs range from 0.58 to 0.78. The
results showed the capacity of the SCCS analysis to discriminate between drugs that were or were not believed to
be causally related to the ADEs. However, within the sets of
drugs selected above the two P-value thresholds (P < 0.05
and P < 0.0005), the precision in some cases did not show a
clear improvement as the P value decreases (Figure 2 and
Supplementary Figure S1). As an example, precision in the
ADE acute renal failure using the P-value scoring method is
similar in the top 10 position and the top 20 (precision = 0.6).

Figure 2 Precision–Recall curves evaluating the four subsets of
ADE candidates originated with SCCS analysis (threshold P < 0.05)
using different methods to rank the candidates (methods: P values,
relative risk (RR), 2D MACCS, 3D structure similarity, ADE, Target,
and ATC similarity). SCCS analysis is useful to originate and select
the subset of ADE candidate drugs. Application of similarity-based
methods in this selected subset can enrich the precision in different
top positions compared with P values and RR. For clarity, precision
is plotted above 0.4. In the recall calculation, only the drugs in the
selected set of drug candidates (P < 0.05) were taken into account.
In the sets of liver failure and gastrointestinal (GI) ulcer, there are
two candidates (the drug–protein candidates interferon beta 1a and
lipase, respectively) that cannot be evaluated using similarity-based
models.

using RR offered better precision results (Figure 2) and pAUROCs (Table 2). However, as it is explained in the next section, combination of SCCS and similarity methods showed an
improvement in ADE detection.
Performance of similarity-based methods in the SCCS
analysis candidates
We applied our 2D and 3D molecular structure, ADE, Target, and ATC similarity-based models to the subset of candidates previously selected through SCCS analysis. We
used two different subsets of drug candidates for each ADE
based on two different P-value thresholds (P < 0.05 and
P < 0.0005). Similarity score assignment for each drug in
every ADE dataset was performed taking out one at a time
(leave-one-out method) and comparing the similarity against
the positive and negative controls in the reference standard
(see ­
Methods section). When the drug candidates within
the threshold P < 0.05 were ranked according to similarity
scores, the analysis showed a clear improvement in precision in different top positions as compared with P values
(Figure 2 and Supplementary Table S1). Using similaritybased methods resulted in greater pAUROCs for the subset
of candidates (Table 2). When performances of the similarity
methods and RR algorithm are compared, similarity methods

still show better performance in some of the studied ADE outcomes (Figure 2 and Table 2). We found similar results for
the set of candidates selected with the threshold P < 0.0005
(see Supplementary Table S1 and Figure S1). The use of
similarity-based models allowed us to obtain better positive
predictive values in some sets. The method is an alternative
system to organize the set of ADE candidates with value in
better understanding the detected ADE–drug relationships.
Rationalization of the signals detected in healthcare data
We can identify for each drug in the test the most similar
drug in the ADE reference standard, with the consequent
associated ADE information available from the literature. This
feature facilitates the decision making in the ADE signal evaluation process. In some cases, depending on the available
literature, the system could help to generate further hypotheses about possible ADE mechanisms of action. Moreover,
these types of models can detect drug pair similarities based
on whether both drugs are in the same or different pharmacological classes. Most frequently, the drugs are in the
same pharmacological class and the information provided by
the system is obvious. When the drugs belong to different
classes, the situation becomes more challenging because
the drug pair relationship is less apparent.
Figure 3 shows some examples of drugs detected by similarity modeling along with the drug source in the reference
standard. Gemcitabine and zidovudine are both nucleoside
analogs with clear structural analogy (Figure 3). The 3D
model associated both drugs with high score (3D_score =
0.84). However, this is a case where both drugs belong to the
same structural category but they could be deemed in different pharmacological classes. Gemcitabine is used in clinic
to treat different types of cancer, and zidovudine is an antiretroviral agent for the treatment of HIV infection. Both drugs
have the potential to cause liver failure, although it is not
clear whether they follow similar etiology. Gemcitabine could
cause a direct hepatic toxicity, and zidovudine could lead
to mitochondrial dysfunction.23 Another example of similarity detected by the model is the pair indomethacin–sulindac
(3D_score = 0.81). In this case, both drugs are nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), belong to the same
pharmacological category, and have the potential to cause GI
ulcer, liver failure, and acute myocardial infarction.
A pair of drugs belonging to different pharmacological
classes and pointed out by the GI ulcer 3D models is fluoxetine–oxaprozin (positive control 3D_score = 0.78). There are

some reports that indicate that the antidepressant fluoxetine
can have some anti-inflammatory properties,24 similar to
the NSAID oxaprozin. However, the mechanism of action in
both drugs could be different. Oxaprozin is believed to inhibit
the enzyme cyclooxygenase (COX) with the consequent
inhibition in the synthesis of prostaglandins. Fluoxetine has
been reported to inhibit the signaling of toll-like receptors,
providing a potential mechanism for their anti-inflammatory
action.24 The ADE GI ulcer in both drugs could be related
to an increased risk of bleeding. Some selective serotonin
reuptake inhibitors like fluoxetine have been related to abnormal bleeding. The possible mechanisms for the ADE could
be by blocking the uptake of serotonin into platelets causing
platelet dysfunction or by an increase in gastric acid secretion leading to a higher risk of GI bleeding.25 Although different mechanisms could be implicated in NSAID-induced GI
ulcer,26,27 platelet inhibition caused by NSAIDs could also be
an important factor to explain an increased risk of bleeding
and therefore GI ulcer.28

The 3D molecular structure model in GI ulcer also detected
that clopidogrel, an antiplatelet agent, is similar to the NSAID
ketoprofen (positive control 3D_score = 0.79). Both drugs
have a different mechanism of action because clopidogrel is
an inhibitor of the P2Y12 adenosine diphosphate receptor and
ketoprofen develops the anti-inflammatory activity through
the inhibition of the COX enzyme.29 However, both drugs
share some pharmacological actions. Both mechanisms,
adenosine diphosphate and COX inhibition, are implicated
in the inactivation of platelets. There is available information
that relates some NSAIDs with antiplatelet properties, i.e.,
the antiplatelet properties of ketoprofen or acetylsalicylic
acid are known.30,31 On the other hand, clopidogrel has been
reported to provide anti-inflammatory renoprotective effects,
although the mechanism of action is still unclear.32 Both
drugs can cause upper GI ulceration, probably accentuated
because of the ADE bleeding associated with their antiplatelet properties. However, the mechanism of action by which
clopidogrel and ketoprofen cause GI ulcer is also probably
different. Although clopidogrel’s mechanism remains unclear,
clopidogrel does not have an effect on the COX pathway.33
On the other hand, ketoprofen is believed to cause the ADE
GI ulcer due to the inhibition of COX-1.29 Moreover, NSAIDs
can cause damage in the GI mucosa following other mechanisms, such as topical irritating effects on the epithelium or
blood flow reduction in the mucosa.27 Although it is hard to
reconcile the different mechanisms of action with the high 3D
similarity, it is worth noting that we also found that clopidogrel
is similar to other NSAIDs, such as etodolac (0.76), bromfenac (0.74), tolmetin (0.73), ketorolac (0.73), mefenamate
(0.73), valdecoxib (0.72), fenoprofen (0.72), and flurbiprofen
(0.72). In fact, in the GI ulcer reference standard, there are
nine NSAIDs within the most 15 similar drugs to clopidogrel
according to the 3D score. However, similarity is not high with
all the NSAIDs. For instance, 3D similarity score between
clopidogrel and acetylsalicylic acid is 0.51. The association
showed by the model does not provide enough evidence
that these drugs cause the ADE GI ulcer through the same
mechanism of action, and more studies would be necessary
to detect if this association is true.
Visualizing correlations between similarity measures
and pharmacological classes
Similarity measures can show some degree of coincidence
with the pharmacological class. To visualize this effect, we

plotted in Figure 4 the similarity matrix for the acute renal failure reference standard (positive and negative controls) using
the four measures: 2D and 3D molecular structure and the
knowledge-database ADE and Target similarities. Each matrix
contains 49 columns and rows, the same number as the drugs
in the reference standard (protein drugs in the initial reference standard, such as lipase, were not included). Drugs were
grouped according to the pharmacological category (brown
dots in the graphic). We represented in each matrix the top
50 drug pair similarity scorings. Red dots represent drug pairs
retrieved in the top 50 belonging to the same pharmacological class. Blue dots represent drug pairs in which both drugs
belong to different pharmacological category. In each matrix,
there are 74 drug pairs belonging to the same pharmacological class within 1,176 possible drug pairs (=(49 × 49 − 49)/2).
Random results would yield 3.15 drug pairs (=50 × 74/1,176)
belonging to the same pharmacological class. As we expected,
the bidimensional similarity matrices showed that all the similarity measures are related to the pharmacological classification showing results far from random (Figure 4; P < 0.001).
However, the measures based on knowledge databases, such
as ADE and Target similarities, are more related to the pharmacological classification than molecular structure measures.
For the ADE and Target similarity matrices in the renal failure
set, we retrieved 34 and 41 drug pairs (of 50) in the same
pharmacological category, respectively (Table 3). However, in
the case of 2D and 3D similarities, we retrieved 17 drug pairs
in the same category in both cases. The same test has been
conducted for the other ADE outcomes mentioned in the current article (Table 3). Results showed similar patterns in the
comparison of the different similarity measures. The methods
based on knowledge data detected above all similarity within
the pharmacological class, whereas 2D and 3D molecular
structure methods showed more flexibility to detect interclass
similarity. This fact showed the pharmacological dependency
of some knowledge data. ADE and Target similarities offered
good results in the previous analysis improving the precision
of the selected drug–ADE associations. However, the information provided by the similarity models in this case is obvious
because the system detects preferably intraclass similarity.
Otherwise, as Figure 4 shows, 2D and 3D structural similarity have the potential of pointing out more challenging drug–
ADE relationships. The figure demonstrates that the molecular
structure (2D and 3D) and pharmacological class, although
overlapping, are not identical and likely complementary.

DISCUSSION
Similarity methods were applied to medication-wide association studies performed in an administrative claims database with 46 million patients. However, similarity-based
modeling can be applicable to improve signal detection
steps using other data mining algorithms or other type of
pharmacovigilance data, such as the FDA Adverse Event
Reporting System or electronic health records.21,22 The
method also allows rationalizing the relevance of the signals to optimize the decision-making process. However,
these type of systems are not intended to replace other considerations used to evaluate the signal relevance, such as
data consistency, biological relationships, or similar signals
detected in other sources of data.34 Our intention is to provide additional information useful in the signal assessment.
A more complete understanding of the conditions related to
the ADE could improve drug patient safety processes.
In this study, similarity-based methods have been applied
after the signals have been detected from healthcare databases with the intention of selecting final candidates pointed
out by two different methodologies. However, implementation of similarity systems for all the drugs studied in healthcare databases would be an alternative to help in the early
detection of ADEs related to newly marketed drugs with not
enough accumulated exposure in the population.
The types of models showed in the current study are highly
dependent on the training dataset, in our case, the ADE reference standard. Different structural and pharmacological
complexity in the reference standard construction could be
responsible for a different performance in the diverse ADE
outcomes. For instance, 2D MACCS ­
(Molecular Access
System) model performs better in the outcomes renal and
liver failure rather than myocardial infarction and GI ulcer.
As an example, some drugs that cause myocardial infarction, such as frovatriptan, are not captured with good score
when compared with other anti-migraine drugs also present in the reference standard, such as zolmitriptan (2D TC
= 0.49). In fact, frovatriptan showed some differences in the
molecular structure, such as a benzamide group not present in other triptan derivatives. Amlodipine and nifedipine,
two calcium channel blockers, constitute another example
of drugs with similar mechanism of action but not captured
by our 2D similarity (TC = 0.48). Both drugs are derivatives
of dihydropyridine, but different substitutions at molecular
level makes difficult the similarity recognition according to
MACCS fingerprint. On the other hand, the 3D model performs better in the ADEs myocardial infarction and GI ulcer
than in renal and liver failure. The drugs mentioned above,
frovatriptan, amlodipine, and nifedipine, showed a better
score according to the 3D similarity (the 3D positive control score is 0.84, 0.82, and 0.82, respectively). As it was
shown in previous studies,35 both 2D and 3D similarity measurements are complementary but different, capturing similarities between different pairs of drugs. Three-dimensional
methods are capable of detecting connections between the
structure and biological characteristics not captured by 2D
methods and vice versa.

Caveats and limitations
Performance of the similarity-based modeling is based on
the reference standard database. External predictive power
could be limited depending on the quality and comprehensiveness of the initial data. Additional improvements in the
initial reference standard databases could be implemented
for the construction of more reliable systems. When the reference standard reflects some complexity, i.e., drugs with
similar pharmacological characteristics in both positive and
negative controls, it would be advisable to use only similarity
scorings against the positive control group to avoid cancellation of the similarity signal.
The nature of the similarity measurement is also an important limiting factor. Some fingerprints could contain certain
bias information. As an example, ADE and Target fingerprints
are calculated from the information contained in knowledge
databases. Although these data sources are of great utility,
the information available could be influenced by pharmacological classification of the drugs. Moreover, these types
of similarity measures have difficulties to correctly evaluate
similarity for some drugs for which there is scarce available
information, i.e., this is the case of new drugs.
METHODOLOGY
Materials
Healthcare data. The database used to apply the similaritybased methods was collected from a previous publication.20
Analysis of four different ADEs was performed using an
observational healthcare database: the CCAE administrative claims database.2,12 The database contained 46.5 million lives. Detailed description about the healthcare data has
been published by our group previously.20
Reference standard datasets. Negative and positive controls,
i.e., drugs that cause the ADEs or do not, were established
based on natural language processing of structured product
labels and systematic search of the scientific literature. We
studied four clinically important ADEs: acute renal failure,
acute liver failure, acute myocardial infarction, and upper GI
ulcer. More details about drug reference standard data collection, including drug names, can be found in a previous
publication.20 Protein drugs, such as lipase or darbepoetin
alfa, were not included in our current databases when similarity measures are applied because molecular structure
analysis is limited depending on size.
Drug structure. We collected the molecular structures of
the drugs included in the study from DrugBank database.29
Structures of some drugs not available in DrugBank were
downloaded from PubChem.36

Methods
SCCS analysis. A SCCS analysis was performed for four
different ADEs in the CCAE administrative claims database.

in the study by Ryan et al.20,37,38 Two sets of drug candidates for each ADE, using as thresholds P < 0.05 and P <
0.0005, were evaluated using similarity-based modeling as
described below.
Two-dimensional molecular structure similarity. We calculated 2D molecular structure similarity between all the drugs
in each database using a 2D molecular fingerprint called
MACCS.39,40 In the fingerprint, we represent each drug as a
bit vector that codifies in each position through 1 or 0 the
presence or nonpresence of different structural keys. For
instance, some structural keys represented in MACCS would
be: position 11 codifies the presence of four-membered rings;
position 78 codifies C=N groups; position 163 codifies sixmembered rings, etc. To simplify the sparse binary vector,
only the positions codifying the fragments that are present
are retained in the final fingerprint representation. More
details about MACCS fingerprint calculation are provided in
a previous study.22,41
We used the Tanimoto coefficient (TC) to calculate the
similarity between all drug pairs. The TC is a measurement
between two fingerprints that ranges from 0 (minimum similarity) to 1 (maximum similarity). The TC is defined as:
NAB
NA + NB − NAB
In the equation, NAB is the number of features present in
common in both fingerprints A and B, NA is the number of
features in fingerprint A, and NB is the number of features
in fingerprint B.
TC =

Three-dimensional molecular structure similarity. 3D similarity is calculated in different steps:
1) Drug database preparation: Bioactive conformations with
specific chiral centers were downloaded from DrugBank.29
The drug database was prepared with LigPrep module from
the Schrödinger 2011 package.42 We generated possible protonation states at neutral pH and a maximum of three enantiomers for unspecified chiral centers for some drugs. This
process also involved optimization of the geometry of the
structures using OPLS_2005,43 the force field that describes
the potential energy of the system.
2) Conformational analysis: The 3D structure of each drug
in the databases was determined through conformational
analysis using water as an implicit solvent in the Macromodel
module from Schrödinger.44 The engine search method
was Monte Carlo Multiple Minimum. For simplicity reasons,
only the structure with the global minimum potential energy
OPLS_2005 was retained and used as a template in the
shape screening step.
3) Shape screening calculations: We used the 3D structures determined in the previous conformational analysis
as template queries to run shape screening calculations for
all the drugs included in the study using phase module from
Schrödinger package.45 Our objective is to identify similar
shape and pharmacophoric properties between all the drugs.

The calculation generated a maximum of 500 conformers
for each drug and aligned them to each template. We calculated a 3D similarity score between all the drug pairs that
ranges from 0 to 1. The similarity score, called Phase Sim
property, was calculated considering the overlapping volume between atoms that present the same pharmacophoric
characteristics.45
ADE similarity: The data about adverse effects were downloaded from SIDER database.46 SIDER is a side effect
resource that contains information about 996 medicines
and 4,192 adverse effects extracted from public documents
and package inserts. Although SIDER is a useful source,
not all the drug reactions are totally confirmed, and in some
cases, further studies would be necessary. However, for
the four ADE outcomes, SIDER database showed a high
degree of coincidence with our reference standard: 94, 84,
92, and 97% of coincidence between SIDER and our reference standards for acute renal failure, acute liver failure,
acute myocardial infarction, and upper GI ulcer, respectively. For labeling the drugs in SIDER as positive or negative, we used the specified ADE terms and related (example
for renal failure: renal failure acute, acute renal insufficiency,
shutdown renal, etc).
We calculated ADE similarity through the use of fingerprints.
For each of the four studied ADEs, we excluded in SIDER
the ADE itself and related terms in the calculation of the fingerprint. The concept of the ADE fingerprint is similar to 2D
molecular structure fingerprints. In the ADE fingerprints, we
codified in the different bit positions the presence or absence
(code 1 or 0, respectively) of different adverse events associated with the drugs. As an example, some adverse events
represented in the calculation of ADE fingerprints would be:
position 1 codifies the presence of the ADE abasia; position
82 codifies the presence of the ADE acidosis; position 563
codifies the presence of the ADE bullous eruption; position
3,385 codifies the presence of the ADE rhabdomyolysis, etc.
We retained in the final ADE fingerprint only the positions
codifying the fragments that are present (sparse binary vector simplification). As described above (see Methods section
for 2D molecular structure similarity), we calculated the TC
between all the drug pair fingerprints.
Target similarity: Data about drug targets were downloaded
from DrugBank database.29 We integrated the drug targets
database with the enzymes, transporters, and carriers datasets from DrugBank. Repeated cases were eliminated. We
also considered targets from different species/organisms as
a unique target case. The procedure to calculate the Target
fingerprints is the same as described before in ADE fingerprints or MACCS, but instead of considering adverse events
or the structural keys, we listed now targets for each bit vector
position. Therefore, we calculated TC between all the Target
fingerprints.
ATC similarity: The ATC Classification System47 is used
for the classification of drugs. Chemical characteristics,

therapeutic action, and information about the system or
organ on which the drugs act are introduced in the database. Because some drugs could have several classification codes, a manual revision of the classification was made
to provide more accurate data. The different categories in
the database are codified in bit positions of a fingerprint as
explained previously. We used the TC to calculate similarity
between all the ATC fingerprints.

Study Highlights
WHAT IS THE CURRENT KNOWLEDGE ON THE
TOPIC?

33 One

of the main objectives in pharmacovigilance is the detection of ADEs through mining
of healthcare databases. Although excellent
results in ADE detection have been reported
for some methods, some challenges and limitations remain.

Construction of ADE similarity matrix and scoring extraction:
All drug pair similarities, based on TC or Phase Sim property, for each ADE reference standard database were integrated in a similarity matrix. A score for each drug in the ADE
reference standard is calculated through a leave-one-out
procedure. Each drug was taken out and evaluated by the
similarity model to compare the performance with the rest of
the candidate drugs. For every drug is defined a maximum
pairwise score (TC or Phase Sim property) obtained against
each drug that produces the ADE in the reference standard
dataset. A second pairwise maximum similarity score against
the set of drugs that do not produce the ADE is calculated.
The final score is provided by the difference between similarity scores, the ADE score, and the non-ADE score. As
an example, the drug meloxicam in the acute renal failure
reference standard was compared in the 2D MACCS model
against the set of drugs that produce the ADE, and the maximum TC pairwise was 0.89. On the other hand, the maximum
TC against the non-ADE drugs was 0.49. The final difference
scoring was 0.40.
Assessment of the similarity models: Evaluation of the similarity methods applied to the four sets of ADE candidates was
compared with the results ranking the drug candidates using
P values and RR. The evaluation focused on the proportion
of true positives for each ADE identified by every approach.
We calculated the precision of the methods (TP/TP+FP)
as a standard measurement to compare the performance.
Precision-Recall graphics were plotted for the four ADEs
considering as true positives and false positives the drugs
in the reference standard deemed as positive and negative
controls, respectively. Areas under the ROC curves were also
reported to compare the performance of the different methods within the P < 0.05 selected subset of candidates (pAUROC). We also evaluated through ROC curves the global
performance of the SCCS analysis in the CCAE administrative claims database.

WHAT QUESTION DID THIS STUDY ADDRESS?

33 We

applied similarity-based modeling techniques, using 2D and 3D molecular structure,
ADE, Target, and ATC similarity measures, to the
candidate associations selected in a medicationwide association study for four ADE outcomes.

WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS TO OUR KNOWLEDGE

33 Our

results showed an enhancement of signal detection to gain efficiency in further
­assessment and follow up. We also proposed an
­approach that facilitates the decision making in
the ADE signal evaluation process through the
identification of the most similar drugs for which
ADE information is available.

HOW THIS MIGHT CHANGE CLINICAL
PHARMACOLOGY AND THERAPEUTICS

33 Our method is simple, applicable on large scale,

useful to strengthen or prioritize signals generated from healthcare databases, and facilitates
ADE detection.
