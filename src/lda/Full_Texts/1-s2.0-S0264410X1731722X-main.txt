Introduction: Currently four recombinant hepatitis B (HepB) vaccines are in use in the United States.
HepB vaccines are recommended for infants, children and adults. We assessed adverse events (AEs) following HepB vaccines reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), a national spontaneous reporting system.
Methods: We searched VAERS for reports of AEs following single antigen HepB vaccine and HepBcontaining vaccines (either given alone or with other vaccines), from January 2005 - December 2015.
We conducted descriptive analyses and performed empirical Bayesian data mining to assess disproportionate reporting. We reviewed serious reports including reports of special interest.
Results: VAERS received 20,231 reports following HepB or HepB-containing vaccines: 10,291 (51%) in
persons <2 years of age; 2588 (13%) in persons 2–18 years and 5867 (29%) in persons >18 years; for
1485 (7.3%) age was missing. Dizziness and nausea (8.4% each) were the most frequently reported AEs
following a single antigen HepB vaccine: fever (23%) and injection site erythema (11%) were most frequent following Hep-containing vaccines. Of the 4444 (22%) reports after single antigen HepB vaccine,
303 (6.8%) were serious, including 45 deaths. Most commonly reported cause of death was Sudden
Infant Death Syndrome (197). Most common non-death serious reports following single antigen HepB
vaccines among infants aged <1 month, were nervous system disorders (15) among children aged 1–
23 months; infections and infestation (8) among persons age 2–18 years blood and lymphatic systemic
disorders; and general disorders and administration site conditions among persons age >18 years.
Most common vaccination error following single antigen HepB was incorrect product storage.
Conclusions: Review current U.S.-licensed HepB vaccines administered alone or in combination with
other vaccines did not reveal new or unexpected safety concerns. Vaccination errors were identified
which indicate the need for training and education of providers on HepB vaccine indications and
recommendations.

1. Background
In the United States, there are five licensed recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen vaccines (HepB vaccines) available as single or
multi-antigen formulations. The two single antigen HepB vaccines

are Engerix-BÒ (GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals (GSK), 1983) [1] and
Recombivax HBÒ (Merck, 1989) [2]. Both are recommended for
all ages in a three doses series. Of the three combination vaccines
containing HepB with other antigens, ComvaxÒ and PediarixÒ are
for infants and children [3,4] while TwinrixÒ is used for adults
[5]. ComvaxÒ (Merck, 1997, currently not produced in the United
States) [6] is a bivalent vaccine also containing Haemophilus B conjugate and was recommended for children aged 2, 4 and 12–15
months [3]. PediarixÒ (GSK, 2002), also containing diphtheria and
tetanus toxoid and acellular pertussis adsorbed (DTaP) and

560

P. Haber et al. / Vaccine 36 (2018) 559–564

inactivated poliovirus, is recommended for children aged 2, 4, 6
months [4]. TwinrixÒ (GSK, 2002), also containing hepatitis A and
B, is recommended for persons aged 18 years [5]. Infants should
get their first dose of hepatitis B vaccine at birth and will usually
complete the series at 6 months of age. All children and adolescents younger than 19 years of age who have not yet gotten the
vaccine should also be vaccinated [7]. Hepatitis B vaccine is
recommended for unvaccinated adults who are at risk for
hepatitis B virus infection [8]. In 2015, 92.6% of U.S. children aged
19–35 months completed all three recommended doses of HepB
vaccines [9].
In pre-licensure clinical trials, adverse events (AEs) following
vaccination with HepB vaccines were mostly injection site reactions and mild systemic reactions [1–5]. Commonly reported mild
AEs include local reactions, like pain (29%), erythema (3%), swelling
(3%); and generalized reactions, like fever (6%) and headache (3%)
[10].
Case reports in the early post-licensure period described temporal association with receipt of HepB vaccine and Guillain-Barré
Syndrome (GBS), chronic illness such as chronic fatigue syndrome
and other neurological disorders like optic neuritis, multiple sclerosis and diabetes mellitus [11], however, causal associations were
not established. Studies have not demonstrated association with
HepB vaccine and neonatal mortality and sepsis [12–14]. An
extensive review by the Institute of Medicine (IOM) concluded that
the evidence is inadequate to accept or reject a causal relationship
between HepB vaccine and neurologic (e.g., encephalitis/
encephalopathy, seizures, multiple sclerosis, GBS) and autoimmune diseases (e.g., systemic lupus erythematosus, vasculitis,
rheumatoid arthritis) [15]. Studies from the CDC’s Vaccine Safety
Datalink [16] did not find associations between HepB vaccine
and rheumatoid arthritis [17], Bell’s palsy [18], autoimmune thyroid disease [19], anaphylaxis [20], optic neuritis [21], GBS [22]
and sudden-onset sensorineural hearing loss [23].
Our safety review assesses AE reports to the Vaccine Adverse
Event Reporting System (VAERS) following HepB vaccination, particularly those after administration of single antigen HepB.
2. Material and methods
2.1. Data source
VAERS is a national passive surveillance system for monitoring
AEs following immunization and is co-administered by CDC and
FDA. VAERS accepts reports from healthcare providers, vaccine
manufacturers, vaccine recipients and others [24,25]. Signs and
symptoms documented in reports are coded using Medical
Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) Preferred Terms
(PTs) [26]; a VAERS report may be assigned more than one
MedDRA PT. Reports are classified as serious if one or more of
the following is reported: death, life-threatening illness, hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, or permanent
disability [27].
2.2. Descriptive analysis
We searched the VAERS database for reports following single
antigen HepB and HepB-containing vaccines administered to children and adults in the United States from January 1, 2005 through
December 31, 2015 (among reports received through April 30,
2016). Reports with unknown age or from foreign sources were
excluded. We analyzed reports by age group, serious or nonserious status, most commonly reported MedDRA PTs, and type
of HepB vaccine. Types included single HepB vaccine given alone

(single vaccine) and HepB-containing vaccines (either single antigen or combination vaccine) administered with other vaccines
(combination vaccines). We conducted descriptive analyses looking at age, sex, onset interval (from vaccination date [day 0] to
onset of first symptoms), and the most common MedDRA PTs Data
were analyzed using SAS (version 9.3, SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC).
2.3. Clinical review of serious reports and pre-specified conditions
following single vaccine
CDC investigators (PM and BH) reviewed the original VAERS
reports and available medical records for death and non-death
serious reports of single vaccine. For death reports, we reviewed
both single vaccines and combination vaccines. We verified the
cause of death from the death certificate and/or autopsy report.
We classified the cause of death into major ICD-10 groups as previously described [28]. For non-death serious reports, we determined the primary AE reported to VAERS and then assigned a
primary diagnostic category using the MedDRA System Organ Class
(SOC) [26]. We also reviewed reports of pre-specified conditions of
interest based on prior post-licensure HepB vaccine safety monitoring and research including anaphylaxis and sepsis in infants
aged <1 month and 1 to <2 months [29,30], and reports with MedDRA PTs (2) any terms which that met the statistical threshold for
signaling in data mining analysis. To identify anaphylaxis reports,
we used MedDRA PTs anaphylactic shock, anaphylactic reaction,
anaphylactoid reaction, and anaphylactoid shock [31]. we did not
conduct formal causality assessment whether a vaccination error
contributed to an AE.
2.4. Data mining
We used empirical Bayesian (EB) data mining to identify AEs
that were reported more frequently than expected following HepB
vaccines (compared to other vaccines) in the VAERS database,
stratified by age and vaccine brand [32]. We used published criteria to identify vaccine-AE pairings that were reported at least twice
as frequently as would be expected (i.e., lower bound of the 90%
confidence interval surrounding the EB geometric mean [EB05]
>2) [33]. We reviewed all reports and available medical records
for vaccine-AE pairings that met the statistical threshold for an
EB data mining signal (EB05 > 2).

3. Results
From January 1, 2005 through December 31, 2015, VAERS
received 20,231 reports following single and combination HepB
vaccines; 51% were in females and 2958 (15%) were serious reports
including 445 deaths (Tables 1a and 1b). Most reports (15,787,
78%), were following combination vaccines. The most commonly
co-administered vaccines were Haemophilus influenzae type bcontaining vaccines (HIBV) 5980 (38%), pneumococcal conjugate
vaccine (PCV7) 5724 (36%), and rotavirus pentavalent vaccine
(RV5) 4343 (28%). Forty-seven percent of single vaccine and 9%
of combination vaccines were reported by the vaccine manufacturer (Tables 1a and 1b).
Among all ages, of 4444 reports of single vaccine, 2365 (53%)
were among persons aged >18 years and 287 (6.5%) were classified
as serious reports. Of the serious reports, 43 were death reports, of
which 27 were infants <1 month of age. The most frequently
reported MedDRA PT following single vaccine was incorrect product storage (22%), and following combination vaccines, fever
was most frequently reported (23%) Table 2.

3.1. Death reports
VAERS received 445 death reports after HepB vaccines (43 after
single vaccine and 402 after combination vaccines; 429 in children
<18 years, 16 in adults. Four-hundred sixteen (93.5%) of 445 had
medical records (e.g., autopsy report, death certificate) to ascertain
the cause of death. Table 3 shows the most common causes of
death for 400 death reports in children aged <12 months. In the
majority (91%) of these death reports, were after combination vaccines. In 36 death reports, only a single vaccine was administered.
Fifteen deaths after combination vaccines were reported among
adults >18 years. Causes of death included diseases of the circulatory (8), nervous (2), digestive (2), or respiratory (1) systems;
injury, poisoning and certain other consequences of external
causes (1); and certain infections and parasitic diseases (1). Three
of 15 received only single vaccine.
3.2. Clinical review of non-death serious reports following single
vaccine administered alone
Two-hundred fifty-eight non-death serious reports following
single vaccine were reported to VAERS; 14 reports did not include

an age and were excluded from the analysis. The age groups with
most reports were adults aged > 18 years (n = 139) and infants ag
ed < 1 month (64). Among infants aged < 1 month, the three most
common SOC categories were nervous system disorders (15)
(mostly seizures), infections and infestations (11) and general disorders and administration site conditions (10). There were 26
reports in children aged 1–23 months, reported conditions (SOC)
included; infections and infestations (8), nervous system disorders
(4), general disorders and administration site conditions (3), two
reports each of immune system disorders, blood and lymphatic
system disorders, cardiac disorders, gastrointestinal disorders,
and one report each of musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders, respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders, and psychiatric disorders. There were 15 non-death serious reports in
children aged 2–18 years, reported conditions (SOC) included:
blood and lymphatic system disorders (3), two reports each of
endocrine disorders, eye disorders, infections and infestations,
immune system disorders, and one report each of respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders, cardiac disorders, general disorders and administration site conditions, and nervous system
disorders. There were 139 reports in adults aged > 18 years, the
most common SOC reported included: general disorders and

for anaphylaxis, two met level 2, and one met level 3. No medical
records were available for the other four reports following single
vaccine, which were considered to be possible anaphylaxis cases.

3.3. Sepsis reports
3.5. Data mining
VAERS received 29 reports of possible sepsis in infants <
2 month of age, eight in infants aged < 1 month and 21 in infants
aged 1 < 2 months. In the infants aged < 1 month, five were male;
all were after single vaccine; median age was 3.5 days (range
0–18 days); median onset interval was 1 day (range of 0–8 days).
There was one death report in a pre-term male diagnosed with
pseudomonas sepsis. All other seven were rule-out sepsis reports.
In the infants aged 1 < 2 months eighteen were rule-out sepsis;
two sepsis and meningitis, and one viral meningitis. Eighteen
(86%) received combination vaccines. All were non-death serious
report median age was 52 days (range 33–60 days); median onset
interval was 0 day (range of 0–8 days).
3.4. Anaphylaxis reports
Of 37 VAERS reports of anaphylaxis, 28 were after combination
vaccines and nine after single vaccine. Of the nine reports following single vaccine, two met Brighton Collaboration criteria level 1

Empirical Bayesian data mining detected disproportionate
reporting (EB05 > 2) for several MedDRA PTs describing vaccination errors (e.g., drug administered to patient of inappropriate
age, incorrect dose administered). These errors frequently
described patients > 20 years of age receiving pediatric doses of
HepB vaccines (n = 57). The most common wrong vaccine administered error occurred in children aged two to five years who
received Pediarix instead of separate DTaP vaccines (n = 24). The
specific DTaP vaccine that was meant to be given instead of Pediarix was not documented in most reports.
The EB data mining detected disproportional reporting for
intussusception after Pediarix (n = 365) in children aged < 2 years.
In 98% of these reports, a rotavirus vaccine was administered concomitantly in children aged < 12 months. For Engerix, the PT disseminated intravascular coagulation (n = 7) was disproportionally
reported. Review of these seven reports revealed these were children aged < 16 months, and all seven cases reported complications

P. Haber et al. / Vaccine 36 (2018) 559–564

due to DIC medical condition. Four reports were deaths where the
cause included toxic epidural necrolysis syndrome and sepsis,
meningitis due to Streptococcus pneumoniae, diffuse encephalopathy, and undetermined cause. The main diagnosis in three DIC
non-death serious reports were hemophagocytic lymphohystiocitosis, status epilepticus and metabolic acidosis, and sepsis of
newborn.
EB data mining also detected disproportionally reporting for
GBS after Twinrix vaccination in children aged 2–9 years. All
(n = 12) GBS reports after Twinrix occurred in military recruits
and all received multiple vaccines on the same day, most
frequently co-administered vaccines were meningitis vaccine
(n = 10) and live attenuated influenza vaccine (n = 5) [34]. Median
onset was 16.5 days (range 1–377 days), 11 with an onset within
42 days. Three had upper respiratory illness or symptoms before
admission for neurological symptoms. Six met Brighton level (BL)
2 criteria for GBS, three BL1 and two BL3 [35].

4. Discussion
This work represents the most comprehensive safety review of
HepB vaccines used in the United States during the period 2005
through 2015. We observed an increase in the number of vaccination error reports for HepB vaccines. The reasons for this increase
are not clear and although these types of errors do not appear to
cause harm to patients, they are preventable events that might
result in patient/parent inconvenience, vaccine wastage and loss
of confidence in the healthcare delivery system [36].
Consistent with previous studies in VAERS, our clinical review
of death reports after single vaccine revealed causes of death consistent with the leading causes of death in the relevant age groups.
A review of reports of death following vaccination in VAERS found
that death following HepB vaccination appeared to be more commonly reported relative to other vaccines in the analysis and the
most common cause of death in reports in infants following HepB
vaccination was SIDS [28]. An early study of VAERS during 1991
through 1998 of neonatal death reports did not find any safety pattern of concern [14]. A population-based study did not find any
association between HepB and neonatal death [37]. SIDS was the
most common cause of death in infant death reports in our VAERS
review of HepB vaccine safety. Infant mortality data places SIDS as
the fourth leading cause of death in the United States among
infants [38]. Because SIDS peaks at the time when children are
receiving a large number of recommended vaccinations, we would
expect a coincidental temporal association between vaccination
and SIDS. This temporal association between a vaccine and SIDS
has also been observed with other vaccines given early in childhood [39].
Simultaneous admiration of HepB with multiple vaccines makes
it difficult to assess the safety of HepB vaccine VAERS reports, our
clinical review focused primarily on reports after a single HepB
vaccine to evaluate if any potential safety concern was associated
with the hepatitis antigen. Our descriptive analysis which assessed
single and combination vaccines separately did not detect marked
safety differences between single vaccine and combination
vaccines.
For Pediarix the disproportionate reporting for ‘intussusception’
may have been most likely related to the concomitant administration of rotavirus vaccines. Intussusception has been reported with
other vaccines co-administered with rotavirus vaccines (e.g., Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccines) [39].
Non-death serious adverse events after single HepB vaccine
comprised AEs expected to occur more frequently based in the
specific age groups and natural risk factors (e.g., high fever in neonate). Thus, for adults aged > 18 years, the SOCs general disorders

563

and administration site conditions followed by musculoskeletal
conditions were most commonly reported to VAERS. The first
SOC included a variety of adverse events (e.g., injection site reactions, systemic reactions) which were commonly described in the
pre-licensure trials for HepB vaccines [7,8].
Sepsis is a serious condition among neonates and among the
leading causes of death early in life [40]. Since neonates receive
HepB vaccine at birth and vaccines can cause fever, increased
sepsis evaluations may occur in the neonatal period after the
birth dose. Our clinical review identified three reports of confirmed sepsis, one in <1 month two in 1- > 2-month infants,
respectively. However, EB data mining did not detect disproportional reporting for sepsis in neonates following HepB. A previous
prospective clinical study during 1991–1994 compared 3302
newborn infants who received HepB vaccine with 2353 infants
who did not receive HepB vaccine. The study found no evidence
that newborn HepB vaccination was associated with an increase
in the number of febrile episodes, sepsis evaluations or allergic
or neurologic events [30].
Disproportional reporting was observed for Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS) after Twinrix vaccination in military recruits. However, all these GBS reports involved patients who received
multiple vaccinations and in a third of reports there was documentation suggestive of an infectious illness prior to HepB vaccination.
Similar findings were previously observed in VAERS following live
attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) administration in military personnel [34]. Evaluation of GBS following LAIV and other simultaneously administered vaccines is being conducted separately by
Defense Health Agency of the Department of Defense.
The most frequently reported MedDRA PT following single vaccines was incorrect product storage. It is possible that stimulated
reporting following increased monitoring of vaccine temperatures
with automated digital data loggers and attention to vaccination
storage errors in 2012 following a government report on this type
of error occurring in the Vaccines for Children program may have
contributed to this reported error [36,41,42]. Although few adverse
health events occurred among the vaccination error cases we
reviewed, these reports highlight the need for error prevention
efforts.
As a spontaneous reporting system, VAERS has important limitations which include biased reporting, over- or under-reporting,
and inconsistency in quality and completeness of reports [24,25].
Other limitations of VAERS include its general inability to assess
causality between an AE and receipt of a vaccine. VAERS can be
useful for detecting rare AEs and can generate hypothesis that
may be studied in other systems or studies.
In our review of reports to VAERS following HepB vaccines, we
did not detect any unusual or unexpected patterns that would indicate a new safety concern. In addition, no particular brand of HepB
stood out. Our findings are consistent with data from pre-licensure
clinical trials and other post-licensure surveillance and research.
Vaccination error reports associated with HepB vaccines appear
to be increasingly reported, highlighting the need for education
and training on prevention of these types of medical errors.
