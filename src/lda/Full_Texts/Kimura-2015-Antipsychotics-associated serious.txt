Abstract
Objective: The reports submitted to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Adverse Event
Reporting System (FAERS) from 1997 to 2011 were reviewed to assess serious adverse events
induced by the administration of antipsychotics to children.
Methods: Following pre-processing of FAERS data by elimination of duplicated records as well as
adjustments to standardize drug names, reports involving haloperidol, olanzapine, quetiapine,
clozapine, ziprasidone, risperidone, and aripiprazole were analyzed in children (age 0-12). Signals in
the data that signified a drug-associated adverse event were detected via quantitative data mining
algorithms. The algorithms applied to this study include the empirical Bayes geometric mean, the
reporting odds ratio, the proportional reporting ratio, and the information component of a
Bayesian confidence propagation neural network. Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS), QT
prolongation, leukopenia, and suicide attempt were focused on as serious adverse events.
Results: In regard to NMS, the signal scores for haloperidol and aripiprazole were greater than for
other antipsychotics. Significant signals of the QT prolongation adverse event were detected only
for ziprasidone and risperidone. With respect to leukopenia, the association with clozapine was
noteworthy. In the case of suicide attempt, signals for haloperidol, olanzapine, quetiapine,
risperidone, and aripiprazole were detected.
Conclusions: It was suggested that there is a level of diversity in the strength of the association
between various first- and second-generation antipsychotics with associated serious adverse
events, which possibly lead to fatal outcomes. We recommend that research be continued in order
to gather a large variety and quantity of related information, and that both available and newly
reported data be placed in the context of multiple medical viewpoints in order to lead to improved
levels of care.

Introduction
Second-generation antipsychotic drugs (SGAs)
are thought to provide different therapeutic outcomes
from first-generation antipsychotic drugs (FGAs), due

to their relatively low affinity for dopamine D2 receptors and affinities for other receptors. SGAs are
believed to improve negative symptoms, depression

Int. J. Med. Sci. 2015, Vol. 12
and quality of life more than FGAs [1]. Medical doctors understand that improved efficacy for these
problems is a great advantage of SGAs; however, little
information is available concerning their superiority
[1]. Weight gain, hyperprolactinemia, and extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) are commonly found in patients treated with FGAs or SGAs [2-5]. Additionally,
neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS), QT prolongation, leukopenia, and suicidal behavior are reported
for both [2-5]; however again, we do not have a consensus on which is better. Additionally, in 2009, a
meta-analysis was published to compare the safety
and efficacy of FGAs and SGAs, in which 150 double-blind studies were included with 21,533 participants [1]. The analysis concluded that SGAs differed
in many properties and were not a homogenous class,
strongly suggesting the importance of detailed investigation of each drug [1].
Recently, the use of antipsychotics, especially
SGAs, has been increasing in children. This is, in part,
explained by their off-label uses, including those for
Attention Deficit / Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)
[6-8]. In the USA, the use of SGAs for children has
been approved since 2006, and this has also contributed to the increase. The surveillance of adverse event
reports submitted to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Adverse Event Reporting System
(FAERS) suggested that antipsychotics are included in
the top 5 reported suspect therapeutic drug classes in
children [9]. In this study, the FAERS database was
used to assess the associations between 5 representative SGAs and adverse events in children. A FGA,
haloperidol, and the recently developed aripiprazole
were also subjected to the investigation, and we focused on 4 rare adverse events, including NMS, QT
prolongation, leukopenia, and suicidal behavior. Data
mining algorithms were used for the quantitative detection of signals [10-18], where a signal means a statistical association between a drug and an adverse
event or a drug-associated adverse event.

Methods
Data sources
Input data for this study were taken from the
public release of the FAERS database, covering the
period from the fourth quarter of 1997 through the
third quarter of 2011. The total number of reports
used was 4,671,217. Besides those from manufactures,
reports can be submitted from health care professionals and the public. The database’s data structure adheres to the international safety reporting guidance
issued by the International Conference on Harmonisation ICH E2B. A data set consists of 7 data tables:
report sources (RPSR), patient demographic and ad-

136
ministrative information (DEMO), drug therapy start
and end dates (THER), indications for use/diagnosis
(INDI), drug/biologic information (DRUG), adverse
events (REAC), and patient outcomes (OUTC). Preferred terms (PTs) in the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) serve as the terminology
for registration of adverse events in REAC table. Here,
version 16.1 of MedDRA was used.
Before data mining was executed, several
pre-processing steps of FAERS were undertaken.
First, duplicated reports, which appear with multiple
CASE field values in the database, were filtered by
applying the FDA’s recommendation of adopting the
most recent CASE number. This processing step reduced the number of reports from 4,671,217 to
3,472,494, a 25.7% reduction. Next, in order to account
for registration of arbitrary drug names including
trade names and abbreviations, which is permissible
within the FAERS system, drug names were mapped
into unified generic names via text mining. As a part
of the standardization process, GNU Aspell was applied to detect spelling errors. Additionally, records of
side effects that are not registered as associated with
the use of a pharmaceutical, such as foods, beverages,
or other medical treatments including radiation
therapy were eliminated. Similarly, adverse event
records with ambiguous drug names such as generic
“beta blockers” were filtered out. As a final filter, only
records were retained in which demographic information indicated that children less than 12 years old
were the recipients of treatment. After applying this
pre-mining filter pipeline, the total number of reports
used was 94,635. Consequently, a total of 1,098,811
co-occurrences were found in 94,635 reports, where a
co-occurrence was a pair constituting a drug and a
drug-associated adverse event.

Definition of adverse events
According to MedDRA version 16.1, NMS, QT
prolongation, leukopenia, and suicide attempt are
coded with preferred terms PT10029282, PT10014387,
PT10024384, and PT10042464 with 7, 10, 5, and 5
lower level of terms (LLTs) assigned, respectively.

Signal Detection Data Mining
Once a collection of filtered adverse event records are assembled, a key question is how to weight
and extract meaningful events as adverse event signals. To this end, a number of algorithms have been
developed, where the common element of the algorithms is that signals are defined as those events reported with a greater frequency than can be expected,
given an estimated expectation for reporting frequency derived from the drugs and ADRs (adverse
drug reaction events) in the record collection to be

analyzed [14-18]. The algorithms used in this study
include: (1) the proportional reporting ratio (PRR) [10]
which is used by the Medicines and Healthcare
products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) in the UK; (2)
the reporting odds ratio (ROR) [11] in use at the
Netherlands Pharmacovigilance Centre; (3) the information component (IC) criteria [12] employed by
the World Health Organization (WHO); (4) and the
empirical Bayes geometric mean (EBGM) [13] which is
a part of FDA analytical methods.
The PRR, ROR, IC, and EBGM methods all employ the use of 2x2 confusion matrices of drug-event
counts; that is, a drug and an event are placed on the
rows and columns of a matrix, and the frequency of
the four possible outcomes is tabulated. Where the
algorithms then differ is that IC and EBGM use
Bayesian reasoning, while the PRR and ROR methods
take the frequentist approach to statistical inference.
Readers are encouraged to consult the references of
each method to obtain extended details.
Here, we summarize the ways in which each test
uses its reasoning and formulation to “detect” a signal. First we consider the classical, frequentist statistical approaches. In the PRR method, a signal is detected if the number of co-occurrences is 3 or more,
and additionally, if the PRR is 2 or more with an associated χ2 value of 4 or more [10]. Using ROR, when
the lower bound of the 95% two-sided confidence
interval exceeds 1, it is an indication of an ADR signal
[11].
Next, we consider the Bayesian methods for
signal detection. The IC algorithm performs signal
detection via the IC025 metric, which is a lower bound
of the 95% two-sided confidence interval of IC, with
an ADR signal indicated by the IC025 value exceeding
0 [12]. For the EGBM method, a lower one-sided 95%
confidence bound of the EBGM, termed the EB05

metric, is used; EB05 is greater than or equal to 2.0
results in an ADR signal [13].
Finally, we need a criterion to unite our use of
the various signal detection methods. In this study,
we elect for the most direct, simple strategy: an adverse event is drug-associated when at least 1 of the 4
algorithms meets its above criteria for signal detection.

Results
The total number of drug and reported adverse
event co-occurrences with haloperidol was 1,600, with
2,802 for olanzapine, 2,440 for quetiapine, 519 for
clozapine, 623 for ziprasidone, 5,219 for risperidone,
and 2,553 for aripiprazole, representing 0.146%,
0.255%, 0.222%, 0.047%, 0.056%, 0.475%, and 0.232%
of all co-occurrences in children in the filtered database, respectively. In total, 181, 345, 313, 119, 139, 380,
and 269 adverse events were extracted as antipsychotics-associated adverse events with 999, 1,644,
1,386, 310, 361, 3,104, and 1,530 co-occurrences with a
signal detected, respectively.
The signals for NMS were detected with the 5
antipsychotics other than clozapine and ziprasidone,
and signal scores for haloperidol and aripiprazole
were greater than for other antipsychotics in Table 1.
As for QT prolongation, signals were detected for
only ziprasidone and risperidone, and signal scores
suggested a stronger association for ziprasidone (Table 2). The signal scores for leukopenia are listed in
Table 3. Although signals were detected for quetiapine, clozapine, and risperidone, the association with
clozapine was noteworthy. Table 4 shows the signal
scores for suicide attempt, and signals for 5 antipsychotics; haloperidol, olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone, and aripiprazole, were detected.

Discussion
According to some recent reports, number of
prescriptions for antipsychotics among younger patients has been increasing [6-8]. Furthermore, the
Guideline “Clinical Investigation of Medicinal Products in the Pediatric Population” [19], which was developed by the ICH expert working group, categorized “children” as 2 to 11 years. Therefore, in this
study, we focused on children less than 12 years old.
NMS is a rare, but potentially fatal complication
of treatment with antipsychotic medication and is
characterized by the development of severe muscle
rigidity and hyperthermia, first described by Delay et
al. in 1968 [20]. In spite of the long period of time since

the first description, to the best of our knowledge,
there have been few reports concerning the association between SGAs and NMS in children. In our
study, signals were detected for 5 antipsychotics, i.e.,
haloperidol, quetiapine, ziprasidone, risperidone, and
aripiprazole (Table 1). Signal scores were higher for
haloperidol and aripiprazole than for the other antipsychotics, suggesting that SGAs show lower susceptibility to NMS. The precise pathophysiology of NMS
remains unknown. It has been suggested that NMS is
the result of dopamine D2 receptor blockade [20-22],
whereas, dopamine D2 receptor antagonism does not
fully explain all of the signs and symptoms of NMS
[22]. According to antipsychotic receptor-binding
profiles, relative affinities for the dopamine D2 rehttp://www.medsci.org

Int. J. Med. Sci. 2015, Vol. 12
ceptor of haloperidol and aripiprazole are higher, and
those of quetiapine and risperidone are lower [4, 21].
Moreover, aripiprazole controls the dopaminergic
function by acting as a partial agonist of dopamine D2
receptor subtypes, while high concentrations of aripiprazole induce dopaminergic blockade [4]. Therefore, our observation may be partially attributed to
these drug action mechanisms.
QT prolongation is also a serious adverse event
accompanying the administration of SGAs, and results from blockade of the delayed rectifier potassium
current (IKr). It is associated with presyncope, syncope, polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, the subtype torsade de pointes, and sudden cardiac death
[23]. Poluzzi et al. reported the torsadogenic risk of
antipsychotics including QT prolongation using
FAERS [24], and Wenzel-Seifert et al. suggested that
QT prolongation occurs most significantly with
ziprasidone in SGAs [25]. However, neither of them
provided data after stratifying by age. Here, the signals for QT prolongation were detected for ziprasidone and risperidone, with the signal score being
higher for the former than the latter (Table 2). In this
study, it was confirmed that ziprasidone is most
strongly associated with QT prolongation in children.
Hematologic abnormalities induced by antipsychotics may be life-threatening in some patients.
Several studies revealed the association between
clozapine and leukopenia in children, and clozapine is
generally recommended for drug-resistant cases
[26-28]. In addition, Etain et al. reported that leukopenia was induced by risperidone [29]. Our results
reproduced these observations, but the signal was
also detected for quetiapine (Table 3).
The incidence of suicide attempt is more frequent in individuals with schizophrenia than in general [30, 31]. Previous studies suggested that the suicide risk differs among antipsychotics [30-33]; however, the impact of antipsychotics on suicide attempt
has been a matter of controversy. Moreover, adherence to antipsychotics is likely to reduce the suicide
risk [30], so suicide attempt in individuals who take
antipsychotics may be due to weakness of efficacy. On
the other hand, an adverse event is generally defined
as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or
clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have
to have a causal relationship with this treatment [34].
Therefore, in this study, we regarded suicide attempt
accompanied with the administration of antipsychotics as adverse events even if it derives from weakness
of efficacy, and FAERS database was reviewed in order to confirm if the suicide risk differs among antipsychotics and is associated with them. As a result,
signals were detected for antipsychotics other than

139
clozapine and ziprasidone, and the scores were higher
for olanzapine and risperidone (Table 4). Tiihonen et
al. revealed that use of clozapine might be more effective than that of other antipsychotics for reducing
suicidal attempt [30]. This might have contributed to
the lack of a signal detection for clozapine.
In conclusion, reports in the FAERS database
were reviewed to assess the antipsychotics-associated
serious adverse events in children. Based on 94,635
reports from 1997 to 2011, it was suggested that there
is a level of diversity in the strength of the association
between various first- and second-generation antipsychotics with associated serious adverse events,
which possibly lead to fatal outcomes. We recommend that research be continued in order to gather a
large variety and quantity of related information, and
that both available and newly reported data be placed
in the context of multiple medical viewpoints in order
to lead to improved levels of care.
