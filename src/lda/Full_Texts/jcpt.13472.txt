Abstract
What is known and objective: The adverse events of thyroid dysfunction caused
by the use of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors
(VEGFR-­TKIs) have not been confirmed in a real-­world investigation. The aim of this
study was to evaluate the relationship between thyroid dysfunction and treatment
using Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-­approved VEGFR-­TKIs.
Methods: Four data-­mining algorithms were employed to detect thyroid dysfunction signals for VEGFR-­TKIs, using data in the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System
(FAERS) database from 68 quarters. MySQL Workbench and R were used to conduct
statistical analysis.
Results and Discussion: We identified 32679 reports of thyroid dysfunction, of which
1567 listed VEGFR-­TKIs as the primary suspected drugs. All four algorithms showed
that the strength of the signals for hypothyroidism were greater than those for hyperthyroidism, for all the VEGFR-­TKIs. In most cases, the median appearance time was
within 100 days of initiation of VEGFR-­TKIs therapy, except in the case of ponatinib.
This indicated the need to actively identify and manage thyroid dysfunction during
the early stages of VEGFR-­TKIs treatment.
What is new and conclusions: This study systematically identified the pharmacovigilance signals of thyroid dysfunction associated with the use of VEGFR-­TKIs, using the
FAERS database.
