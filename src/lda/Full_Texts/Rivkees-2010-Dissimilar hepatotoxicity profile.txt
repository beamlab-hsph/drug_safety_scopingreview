Objective: Our objective was to assess safety and hepatotoxicity profiles of propylthiouracil and methimazole by age in the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s Adverse Event Reporting System (AERS).
Design: We used the multi-item gamma-Poisson shrinker (MGPS) data mining algorithm to analyze
more than 40 yr of safety data in AERS. MGPS uses a Bayesian model to calculate adjusted observed
to expected ratios [empiric Bayes geometric mean (EBGM) values] for every drug-adverse event
combination in AERS, focusing on hepatotoxicity events.
Results: MGPS identified higher-than-expected reporting of severe liver injury in pediatric patients
treated with propylthiouracil but not with methimazole. Propylthiouracil had a high adjusted reporting ratio for severe liver injury (EBGM 17; 90% confidence interval ⫽ 11.5–24.1) in the group less than
17 yr old. The highest EBGM values for methimazole were with mild liver injury in the group 61 yr and
older [EBGM 4.8 (3.3– 6.8)], which consisted of cholestasis. Vasculitis was also observed for propylthiouracil in children and adolescents, reaching higher EBGM values than hepatotoxicity signals.
Conclusions: MGPS detects higher-than-expected reporting of severe hepatotoxicity and vasculitis
in children and adolescents with propylthiouracil but not with methimazole. (J Clin Endocrinol
Metab 95: 3260 –3267, 2010)

raves’ disease is the most common cause of hyperthyroidism in children, adolescents, and adults and
is treated with antithyroid drugs, radioactive iodine, or
surgery (1). In children and adolescents, the antithyroid
drugs propylthiouracil and methimazole are widely used
as first-line therapy for patient with Graves’ disease (1). In
2008, it was estimated that 2000 pediatric patients in the
United States were treated with propylthiouracil and 4000
with methimazole (2).
Propylthiouracil was introduced for clinical use in 1947
and methimazole in 1952 (2). Over the 60 yr that these
medications have been used, reports of adverse events for

both medications have appeared (2), including reports of
propylthiouracil-related liver failure and death in more
than 30 individuals between 6 and 62 yr of age (2– 4).
Children also appear to be disproportionately represented
in reports of propylthiouracil-induced liver injury compared with adults (2, 4, 5).
To date, there has not been a systematic evaluation of
the adverse events reporting associated with propylthiouracil and methimazole use. To address this issue, we applied a novel database analysis approach to identify the
overall safety reporting of propylthiouracil and methimazole and their liver-associated safety reporting in the huge

Background: The antithyroid drugs propylthiouracil and methimazole were introduced for clinical
use about 60 yr ago and are estimated to be used in more than 6000 children and adolescents per
year in the United States. Over the years that these medications have been used, reports of adverse
events involving hepatotoxicity have appeared. To date, there has not been a systematic and
comparative evaluation of the adverse events associated with antithyroid drug use.

Materials and Methods
We performed data-mining analysis of the AERS database maintained by the FDA using Empirica Signal software and the multiitem gamma-Poisson shrinker (MGPS) data-mining algorithm
(6, 7). MGPS was run using simultaneously all event terms and
all suspect drugs in the AERS database as of December 31, 2008.
The MGPS run also included custom liver injury terms defined
below that combined several standard preferred terms, as
follows.
Severe liver injury (custom term) included ammonia abnormal, ammonia increased, coma hepatic, hepatic necrosis, hepatitis, hepatic failure, hepatitis acute, hepatitis fulminant, acute
hepatic failure, hepatitis acute, hepatocellular injury, hyperammonemia, hyperammonemic encephalopathy, liver transplant,
hepatic encephalopathy, hepatotoxicity, and subacute hepatic
failure.
Mild liver injury (custom term) included the absence of the
above terms in the reports and reports containing any of following preferred terms: alanine aminotransferase increased, aspartate aminotransferase increased, blood bilirubin abnormal,
blood bilirubin increased, cholestasis, cholestasis of pregnancy,
cholestatic liver injury, cholestatic pruritus, hepatic enzyme abnormal, hepatic enzyme increased, hepatic function abnormal,
hepatitis cholestatic, hyperbilirubinemia, icterus index increased, jaundice, jaundice acholuric, jaundice cholestatic, jaundice hepatocellular, liver function test abnormal, neonatal cholestasis, ocular icterus, and urine bilirubin increased.
MGPS generated over 13 million rows of unique drugevent values across all drug and events in AERS, including
values for propylthiouracil and methimazole, by year of the
report and age. Results were filtered to display the results for
propylthiouracil and methimazole where at least one adverse
event was reported. The MGPS program calculated lower and
upper bounds of 90% confidence limits for each empiric Bayes
geometric mean (EBGM) value denoted as EB05 and EB95, respectively. To identify reporting differences between the two drugs, we
assessed the overlapping/nonoverlapping status of (EB05, EB95)
intervals of one drug with regard to the other.

The primary goal of the analysis was to assess liver injury
signals in children and adolescents with propylthiouracil and
methimazole. The secondary focus was to describe the age effects
of these signals as well as to describe non-liver-associated adverse
event signals. Adverse events associated with propylthiouracil
and methimazole use during pregnancy were excluded.

MGPS data-mining method
MGPS applies a Bayesian model to simultaneously analyze
disproportionality of reporting ratios for each drug event in the
huge AERS database relative to all other drugs and events in the
database. MGPS calculates adjusted relative reporting ratios for
pairs of drug-event combinations and for higher-order (e.g. triplet and quadruplet) combinations of drugs and events that are
significantly more frequent than their pairwise associations
would predict. MGPS systematically shrinks observed to expected ratios that cannot be precisely estimated because of small
counts. This approach helps reduce false-positive signals.
The MGPS program typically stratifies data in AERS by over
1300 categories, including over 40 categories by year, 11 categories by age group, and three categories by gender (male, female, and not stated) to adjust for background differences in
relative reporting ratios by these variables. This stratification
procedure reduces potential confounding variables, including
those related to database changes over time, prescribing paradigm changes, and due to independent relationships between a
drug and a stratum variable and an event and the same stratum
variable.
EBGM values indicate the strength of the reporting relationship between a particular drug and event pair and reflect the
relative reporting rates (after Bayesian smoothing) for the drugevent pairs studied. For example, if the EBGM is 10, then the
drug-event combination is reported at 10-fold greater frequency
than if there were no association between the drug and the event.

Results
From January 1, 1968, until December 31, 2008, AERS
collected a total of 651 reports for propylthiouracil and
822 for methimazole across all age groups (Fig. 1). There
were more methimazole than propylthiouracil reports, except in the youngest age group (⬍17 yr; Table 1).
The highest EBGM values for propylthiouracil in the
age group of less than 17 yr and in the overall analysis in
all age groups were for vasculitis events, with several
EBGM values for vasculitis events greater than 50 times
higher than expected (Tables 2 and 3). These problems
included antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-positive,
leukocytoclastic vasculitis, glomerulonephritis, and other
forms of vasculitis. Either these events were reported only
with propylthiouracil or EBGM values were higher for
propylthiouracil than for methimazole (Tables 2 and 3).
When hepatotoxicity was examined in children and adolescents, major differences in the number and proportion
of severe liver injury reports for propylthiouracil vs. methimazole were observed (Tables 2 and 4 and Fig. 2). We

U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) Adverse
Events Reporting System (AERS) database.
AERS is a spontaneous reporting database that is the
primary data resource for the study and identification of
adverse drug reactions in the United States. The FDA has
maintained the AERS database of adverse drug events submitted to the FDA by the pharmaceutical industry and the
public since 1968. AERS contains about 5 million such
reports, and the FDA receives over 1200 new reports each
day. AERS has over 10,000 preferred terms (codes) of
adverse events in use. The large number and complexity of
these reports necessitates the use of statistical algorithms
to supplement traditional methods to detect drug safety
problems from this large database. Using a novel approach
for database mining, we used AERS data to assess the
nature and relative strength of adverse events associated
with propylthiouracil and methimazole, focusing on the
pediatric population.

observed 23 cases of severe liver injury in the age group less
than 17 yr with propylthiouracil; no cases were seen with
methimazole. These propylthiouracil reports accounted
for 0.86% of the total reports of severe liver injury in
AERS. When mild liver injury was examined in children
and adolescents, we observed mild liver injury in the under-17-yr age group in four children and adolescents
treated with propylthiouracil and in one child treated
with methimazole (Table 4). Propylthiouracil accounted for 0.08% and methimazole 0.02% of total
reports of mild liver injury in the AERS database. When
we assessed these proportions regardless of age, propylthiouracil accounted for 0.17% and methimazole for
0.05% of severe liver injury and for 0.04 and 0.09% of
mild liver injury (Table 4).
When data were examined using MGPS across age
groups, the EBGM values for severe liver injury with propylthiouracil were higher in younger (⬍17 yr) than older
individuals (ⱖ17 yr), regardless of whether we assessed
the individual severe preferred terms or the severe liver
injury custom term (Fig. 3). Side-by-side comparison of
overlapping/nonoverlapping status of (EB05, EB95) intervals for severe liver injury adverse events for all age
groups showed them to be higher with propylthiouracil

with propylthiouracil use in children and adolescents, a
risk that is not present with methimazole. These observations are consistent with case reports and liver transplantation data, which reveal serious liver injury associated
with propylthiouracil use in children and adolescents, but
not with methimazole (2, 3, 5).
AERS data show that whereas there were more overall
reports for propylthiouracil than methimazole, propylthiouracil-associated reports were more common than
those with methimazole in the pediatric population. When
pediatric propylthiouracil reports were evaluated, two
major safety signals were observed, vasculitis and hepatotoxicity, which were very low for methimazole in children and adolescents.
Although the primary focus of our report was liver injury, a major vasculitis safety signal associated with propylthiouracil use in children and adolescents was observed. Vasculitis associated with methimazole use was
also observed, but strength of association scores were
lower than those observed for propylthiouracil. These observations are in accord with reports of vasculitis associ-

ated with antithyroid drug use and children and adolescents (8 –11) and reports showing a higher risk of
developing antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies with
propylthiouracil than methimazole (12).
Propylthiouracil-associated severe hepatotoxicity was
seen at all ages, but age-related data showed that reports
and signals of propylthiouracil-associated hepatotoxicity
were greatest in individuals less than 17 yr of age. In comparison, there was no methimazole-associated hepatotoxicity signal in children and adolescents. Methimazole hepatotoxic signals in adults were seen in the oldest age group
and consisted largely of cholestasis.
To date, more than 30 cases of propylthiouracil-induced liver failure have been reported in individuals with
ages ranging between 6 and 62 yr of age (2, 3, 5). Recovery
from liver failure without transplant occurred in 18 individuals, transplantation occurred in three persons, and
nine deaths were reported. Of these cases, 14 were pediatric patients (2, 3, 5). There were three deaths in propylthiouracil-treated pediatric patients (2, 3, 5). Five children who underwent liver transplantation have been
reported as well (2, 3, 5). The MGPS analysis of FDA
AERS data support the impression in the published literature that children and adolescents are more vulnerable to
propylthiouracil-mediated hepatotoxicity than adults.
Studies reporting outcomes of pediatric Graves’ disease
treated with propylthiouracil, in which adverse events
were discussed, also reveal propylthiouracil-related adverse events. These cohorts included more than 550 propylthiouracil-treated patients (2). Adverse events related
to propylthiouracil use occurred in 15–35% of children
and adolescents (13–15), except for one report that de-

scribed problems in one of 63 patients (16). Cohort studies
describing adverse events related to methimazole are few.
In a recent study of the methimazole analog carbimazole,
of 147 treated children, eight children developed rash and
one child developed agranulocytosis (17).
One issue of potential concern that was not possible
for us to address in this cohort was the possibility of
toxic effects of propylthiouracil on the fetus. However,
we have been made aware of a newborn with lethal
fulminant hepatitis born to a mother treated with propylthiouracil during pregnancy (S. Harada, Tokyo, Japan; personal communication).
In comparison with reports of propylthiouracil-induced hepatocellular necrosis, liver-related problems associated with methimazole use are related to cholestasis,
which has been reported in 20 adults (18 –27). Methimazole-related cholestasis is associated with high doses and
older age (25). There is one case report of methimazolerelated liver failure leading to death in a 43-yr-old man
with hyperthyroidism and hepatitis B (28). The death of a
20-yr-old woman treated with 90 mg/d methimazole for 8
months has been reported (29). Similar to the published literature, there were no AERS reports of methimazole-related
liver failure, liver transplants, or deaths in pediatric patients.
AERS data also revealed that methimazole hepatotoxic adverse events were most likely to occur in older adults.

Review of the Organ Procurement and Transplantation
Network, United Network for Organ Sharing, data (30)
reveals that propylthiouracil is the third most common
cause of drug-induced liver failure in children and adolescents, accounting for 10% of drug-related transplants
(30). From 1990 –2007, 23 propylthiouracil-related liver
transplants were performed (2). Ten of the liver transplant
recipients were pediatric patients. No methimazole-related liver transplants occurred over this period in children
or adults (2, 3, 5). The MGPS analysis of FDA AERS data
also indicates that the risks for liver failure and the need for
liver transplantation were associated with propylthiouracil use. It is important to note that not all cases of propylthiouracil-induced liver failure leading to transplantation
included in the United Network for Organ Sharing database were present in AERS data. In addition, whereas
some narratives described the need for liver transportation, they were not coded as liver transplant.
It is also important to note that AERS reporting is dependent on submissions by consumers, practitioners, and
manufacturers and is thus prone, in general, to underreporting. The determination of observed to expected ratios
using the total number of AERS reports as a surrogate for
exposure, however, has been shown to provide a reasonable approach to approximating relative reporting in
datasets where the denominator is unknown, as with

FIG. 2. Comparative sector map (heat map) display of adverse events in the MedDRA Hepatic System Organ Class for propylthiouracil (left) and
methimazole (right) in individuals less than 17 yr of age. The numbers indicate the ranking of EBGM values for each preferred term (PT). Preferred
terms are grouped by higher-level terms and by higher-level groups in MedDRA. The size that each preferred term occupies in the graphic display
reflects its association with serious outcomes in AERS across all drugs (the larger the space, the higher is its association with a serious outcome.)
For example, hepatitis, hepatic necrosis, and hepatic failure (events ranked 1, 2, and 3 with propylthiouracil) occupy a larger space in the graph
because they are more highly associated with a serious outcome than jaundice cholestatic (ranked 4 with propylthiouracil) that occupies a smaller
space. Liver transplant appears in the surgical system organ class (SOC) and, therefore, is not listed here. For Figs. 2– 4, MGPS performed analyses
for each age group after stratifying the AERS data by over 40 categories by year and three categories by gender (male, female, and not stated).

spontaneous data (7, 31). Considering the recent alerts
that have been sent to practitioners by the FDA and endocrine organizations and in publications about the risk of
hepatotoxicity (3–5, 32), it will be important to reassess if
liver-related and other adverse events associated with propylthiouracil decline. It will also be important to monitor
methimazole adverse events, because this drug will have
preferred use as the antithyroid medication.

Over the six decades that propylthiouracil has been
used, reports of propylthiouracil-related liver failure and
death in children, adolescents, and adults have accumulated in the published literature and FDA databases. In
comparison, we are unaware of reports of death and liver
failure in children and adolescents taking methimazole,
and there are far fewer and less serious adverse events
reported for methimazole than propylthiouracil in gen-

association of the adverse event with the drug. For each event, we show the propylthiouracil data in one row and the methimazole data in
another. Note that at all ages, the EBGM values are higher for propylthiouracil than for methimazole and the confidence intervals do not overlap.
Note that propylthiouracil is associated with many more liver-related adverse events at young ages than methimazole.

eral. The risk of severe propylthiouracil hepatotoxicity is
also a concern for the adult population. Considering the
above, our observations support the recommendations
that propylthiouracil use should be avoided (3–5, 32), especially in the pediatric population.
Our observations also highlight the utility of the systematic analysis of adverse event reports in large databases
using methods that decrease false-positive rates due to
small numbers while preserving stable signals with small

number of reports. This effect is important for early detection of signals as well as for detection of signals in subgroups at risk and drug-drug interactions where the problem with small numbers intensifies. There is also a need to
link disparate databases such as AERS, transplantation
databases, and electronic medical records currently not
automatically linked with each other to help quickly confirm signals across several data resources. We also need to
speed the detection of dissimilar safety profiles among

FIG. 4. The EBGM values by age group and drug for the custom term that defines mild liver injury and for the individual preferred terms. Note the
signal strength (EBGM value by color and by the annotation below each minigraph also containing the EB05-EB95 values) and the count of reports
(number within each minigraph). The higher the EBGM score indicates a higher strength of association of the adverse event with the drug. For
each event, we show the propylthiouracil (PTU) data and the methimazole (MMI) data. Note that at the older age group, the EBGM values are
higher for methimazole than propylthiouracil. *, Events with higher and nonoverlapping EBGM values for propylthiouracil than for methimazole
or events reported only with propylthiouracil; **, events with higher and nonoverlapping EBGM values for methimazole than propylthiouracil or
events reported only with methimazole.
