Background: The use of a statistical approach to analyze cumulative adverse event (AE)
reports has been encouraged by regulatory authorities. However, data variations affect statistical
analyses (eg, signal detection). Further, differences in regulations, social issues, and health care
systems can cause variations in AE data. The present study examined similarities and differences
between two publicly available databases, ie, the Japanese Adverse Drug Event Report (JADER)
database and the US Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS),
and how they affect signal detection.
Methods: Two AE data sources from 2010 were examined, ie, JADER cases (JP) and Japanese
cases extracted from the FAERS (FAERS-JP). Three methods for signals of disproportionate
reporting, ie, the reporting odds ratio, Bayesian confidence propagation neural network, and
Gamma Poisson Shrinker (GPS), were used on drug-event combinations for three substances
frequently recorded in both systems.
Results: The two databases showed similar elements of AE reports, but no option was provided
for a shareable case identifier. The average number of AEs per case was 1.6±1.3 (maximum 37)
in the JP and 3.3±3.5 (maximum 62) in the FAERS-JP. Between 5% and 57% of all AEs were
signaled by three quantitative methods for etanercept, infliximab, and paroxetine. Signals
identified by GPS for the JP and FAERS-JP, as referenced by Japanese labeling, showed higher
positive sensitivity than was expected.
Conclusion: The FAERS-JP was different from the JADER. Signals derived from both
datasets identified different results, but shared certain signals. Discrepancies in type of AEs,
drugs reported, and average number of AEs per case were potential contributing factors. This
study will help those concerned with pharmacovigilance better understand the use and pitfalls
of using spontaneous AE data.

Spontaneous report systems are utilized for pharmacovigilance. Over 100 countries
provide adverse event (AE) reports to the World Health Organization Uppsala Monitoring Center through the World Health Organization Programme for International
Drug Monitoring, allowing the Uppsala Monitoring Center to maintain VigiBase™,
a database with approximately 8,000,000 cases.1 Another well-known pharmacovigilance database is the US Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting
System (FAERS),2 a database with over 4,000,000 worldwide spontaneous AE
reports. These reports have been partially available for free public access online since
1997. In Japan, the Pharmaceutical and Medical Device Agency, established by the
Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare in 2004, began offering free access to part

of its database, ie, the Japanese Adverse Drug Event Report
(JADER), in April 2012.3 The JADER database contains
approximately 230,000 AE cases reported after April 2004.3
Each database complies with the globally accepted standard
for electronic submission of individual case safety reports4
in pharmacovigilance, and uses the Medical Dictionary for
Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) terminology.5 The JADER
contains AE cases occurring specifically in Japan, while
VigiBase and the FAERS contain worldwide cases. They are
intended for descriptive or statistical analysis, not narrative
assessment. It must be emphasized here that the spontaneous reporting system of each country is underpinned by
the common purpose of drug safety, and reporting systems
are affected by differences in regulations, and social and
historical backgrounds across countries. Further, knowledge
about how AE data in spontaneous report systems differ is
scarce, because most authorities do not make their spontaneous reports system data publicly available.
While they cannot replace qualitative assessment, quantitative methods are expected to enhance pharmacovigilance
activity. Point estimates of reporting disproportionality, such
as the reporting odds ratio (ROR)6 and proportional reporting ratio,7 have been proposed as quantitative approaches.
They are simple methods for disproportionality analyses
of frequency statistics. On the other hand, more complex
methods for detecting signals from large databases have been
discussed and developed. Bayesian methods have been used

recently to solve potential false positive errors associated with
the spontaneous reporting system database. For example, the
Bayesian confidence propagation neural network (BCPNN)
was developed by the Uppsala Monitoring Center in 1998 and
applied to VigiBase.8 Another method, developed by the US
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1998, is the Gamma
Poisson Shrinker (GPS).9 Statistical signal generation based
on disproportionality among reported drug-event combinations is commonly used to prioritize case reports for further
review.4 However, only a decade or so has passed since
regulatory authorities adopted such quantitative approaches
to explore AE case databases.
This study aimed to address whether different databases
developed for the same purpose indicated quantitative
signals similarly. The targeted comparative databases were
the JADER and FAERS. From a pharmacovigilance perspective, the results will help pharmaceutical companies
and researchers avoid the pitfalls of spontaneous reporting
system databases.

Comparison of adverse event reports databases

databases, ie pharmaceutical companies’ suspected AE
reports, are compliant with the International Conference for
Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration
of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) guidelines.13–16
Thus, the databases basically adhere to ICH-standardized
AE information guidelines and provide the main items for
each AE case, such as age, sex, medicinal product/substance
name, nature of AE, and case outcome. Publicly available
items are rather limited when compared with the full items
of AE case reports. Most importantly, ICH-defined case
identifiers are not available in the FAERS or the JADER.
The MedDRA Preferred Term was provided for medical
terminology in both databases. Product names in the FAERS
have to be converted to substance names; the Japanese agency
provides only substance names. The JADER has vaccine and
biologic products and provides medicinal product substance
names for all cases; some cases in the FAERS include product
name only. The FAERS covers both serious and non-serious
cases. Companies report AE cases occurring in the USA and
non-USA to the FAERS. Companies also report AE cases
that occurred in Japan and outside of Japan to the Japanese
authority, which only opens Japanese cases.
Therefore, Japanese cases were considered for data
comparison. To evaluate similarities and discrepancies
between the datasets and to avoid country-specific AE
reporting customs, this study used the FAERS Japanese
cases reported in 2010 (FAERS-JP) and all cases reported
to the JADER in 2010 (JP). The studied dataset was downloaded in May 2012 from the Pharmaceuticals and Medical
Devices Agency and the January to December 2010 FAERS
datasets in August 2012. Year was identified as the date
on which the FDA received the report and the quarter of
the fiscal year in which the Japanese agency received the
report provided in the JADER. In addition, as a reference,
US cases in the FAERS (FAERS-US) were selected. With
technical support from the Japan Pharmaceutical Information
Support Center, the FAERS-JP, FAERS-US, and JP were
obtained from the respective spontaneous reporting system
databases. Although the FDA introduced a Standard Generalized Markup Language dataset in 2013, the old dataset

type was investigated to apply experienced data management
techniques. MedDRA version 15.0 was used to code Japanese
medical terms verbatim and their English translations for
the JADER. The center’s coding technique17 helped to
translate drug/substance names in English in the FAERS
into Japanese for comparison with the Japanese substance
names found in the JADER. “Paroxetine hydrochloride”
and “paroxetine mesylate” are marketed in the USA, and the
ambiguous “paroxetine” was reported to the FAERS as well,
but only “paroxetine hydrochloride” is available in Japan. The
analysis distinctively used base-level substance names. Note
that, due to patient privacy and unknown product names, it
is difficult to judge whether a JADER case report matches
to one or more case reports in the FAERS.

Detecting signals of disproportionate
reporting
In order to compare the number of signals of disproportionate
reporting between the FAERS and JADER, the top three common substances frequently reported as primary suspect drugs
in 2010 were selected, ie, etanercept, infliximab, and paroxetine hydrochloride. In Japan, etanercept has been on the
market since January 2005, infliximab since June 2002, and
paroxetine hydrochloride since November 2000; in the USA,
these substances have been available since November 1998,
August 1998, and December 1992, respectively.
Three methods, ie, ROR, BCPNN, and GPS, were selected
for signal detection at the drug-event combination level, with
reference to the report on data mining applied to the safety
evaluation process at the Japanese agency.18 Table 2 presents
the contingency table used in disproportionate reporting signals based on drug-event combinations. The FDA remodeled
the GPS to the Multi-Item GPS to stratify data. However, the
Multi-Item GPS has an intrinsic risk of system overload, and
has not been tested by the Japanese agency. Others have documented the formulas and implications of these methods.19,20 In
this study, ROR/exp (1.96 se [standard error]) 1, Information Component -2 SD [standard deviation] 0, and the lower
5th percentile in the posterior distribution (EB05) 2 were the
thresholds for ROR, BCPNN, and GPS, respectively, where

se, SD and EB05 were the standard error of ROR, the standard
deviation of the information component and the lower 5th
percentile in the posterior distribution. These thresholds were
applied and the number of detected signals was compared
between the three datasets for each technique. We referred
to Japanese label information as of October 2013 to identify
any commonly signaled drug-event combinations.
Since the patient reporting system started as a trial at
the end of March, 2012 in Japan,12 few patient reports were
expected in the JADER. Thus, signal detection was also
conducted with medically confirmed reports only to reduce
reporter bias and compare with the entire original reports.

Results
Descriptive comparison between
datasets
Table 3 shows an overview of AE reports in 2010 for comparison. Although the number of reported cases and primary
suspected substances in the FAERS-JP was smaller than that
in the JP, the number of reported AEs was larger, resulting in
1.6 and 3.3 AEs per case on average in the JP and FAERS-JP,
respectively. The datasets provided roughly the same number
of drug-event combinations at the preferred term level, while
certain combinations showed different trends. AEs looked
more severe in the JP for pyrexia, the most frequent AE in
the FAERS-JP. Frequency of AEs at the MedDRA system
organ class level differed between the JP and the FAERS-JP,
for example, in “Blood and lymphatic system disorders”,
“General disorders and administration site conditions”, and
“Injury, poisoning and procedural complications” (Figure 1).
Most of the Japanese cases (94.1% in the JP, 85.6% in the
FAERS-JP) were medically confirmed, while consumers or
lawyers initially reported one half of the FAERS-US cases.
Although the JADER provides expedited reports, 6.2% of
the FAERS-JP were periodic reports.

Detecting signals of disproportionate
reporting
The signals identified for etanercept, infliximab, and paroxetine hydrochloride are shown in Table 4. The JP had the
smallest number of cases for each substance. The proportion
of signals to drug-event combinations was higher for the JP
than for FAERS-JP and FAERS-US; the number of signals
for the three substances accounted for between 9.5% and
57.4% of the total number of drug-event combinations in
the JP, between 4.3% and 42.1% of the FAERS-JP, and
between 4.7% and 40.7% of the FAERS-US. Regarding
the two Bayesian methods, the GPS detected a marginally

smaller number of signals than did the BCPNN. As “Reporter
type” in Table 3 shows that the JP has fewer consumer and/
or lawyer reports than do the other datasets, when limited to
medically confirmed reports, the detection ratios of the three
substances were similar or increased in the JP, similar with a
slight increase and decrease in the FAERS-JP, and rose and
fell in the FAERS-US.
Figure 2 shows signal homogeneity. Across substances
and signal detection methods, the FAERS-JP had approximately 1.5 to 2 times more signals identified than the JP.
Consequently, the intersection ratio of signals between the
JP and FAERS-JP was lower than it was in the FAERS-JP.
With the Japanese cases in 2010, GPS detected the smallest
number of signals. While the JP found the highest intersection
rate in BCPNN, GPS identified more common signals than
did ROR and BCPNN for each substance in the FAERS-JP.
GPS found seven common signals in etanercept, nine in
infliximab, and 12 in paroxetine.
Among the signals commonly identified between the
JP and FAERS-JP, only one drug-event combination, ie,
etanercept and organizing pneumonia, was unlisted in the
Japanese label information. In comparison, for etanercept,
infliximab, and paroxetine hydrochloride the FAERS-US
provided only five signals of 28 drug-event combinations
commonly detected by the JP and FAERS-JP (Table 5); the
FAERS-US, however, had the most drug-event combinations and signals.

Discussion
Discrepancies between the FAERS
and JADER
This comparison study revealed distinct discrepancies in
reported drugs, reported AEs, reporter type, seriousness,
and average number of reported events per case, between
the JADER and FAERS. It is not surprising that the two
databases showed different features, because differences can
arise as a function of discrepancies in reporting rules and
customs, such as reporters and reported AE terms, which
are deeply rooted in regulations. For example, the FAERS
includes “drug exposure during pregnancy” and “no adverse
events” based on regulations; these are not mandatory in
Japan. Significant differences in the frequency of features
such as “general disorders and administration site conditions”
and “investigations” in Figure 1 can be explained by different requirements in case seriousness; US companies need
to submit case reports with non-serious AEs, but reporting
of known non-serious AEs is not mandatory for Japanese
companies.

Social factors and health care systems also have a considerable impact. Regarding descriptive research on claims
and spontaneous reporting system databases in Asia, report
discrepancies could be caused by the history of each national
effort to raise the reporting rate.21 For example, in the JADER,
very few reports from non-professionals were found because
Japan initiated a reporting system trial derived directly from
patients in 2012.12 As another example, interstitial lung disease
is the most frequently reported AE in Japan. Japan has experienced serious social concerns with interstitial lung disease
related to several drugs; in addition, X-ray imaging available
in Japanese clinics and hospitals allows interstitial lung disease to be found more frequently. There might also be coding
bias. The use of terminologies and coding systems requires
practices and knowledge for users to minimize heterogeneity
in reporting and enhance internal and external validity.
Not all Japanese-approved medicinal products are
launched in the USA, so fewer Japanese AE cases were
reported to the FDA than to the Japanese authority in 2010.
Another striking difference was the average number of events
reported per case, presumably due to non-serious issues
as discussed at the beginning of the section. If companies
reported the same case to the two regulatory databases in the
same manner, these values should be identical. However,
differences in reporting regulations have been infrequently
discussed when it comes to medicines used globally. For
example, pharmaceutical companies are encouraged to expedite reports for serious AEs accessible through the JADER,
whereas unknown non-serious AEs, required for periodical
reports, are not typically available there. On the other hand,
the FDA stores both expedited and periodic reports in the
FAERS, and these country-specific regulations would lead
to different qualitative or quantitative assessment results
between regulatory agencies. Additionally, if a pharmacovigilance agreement between corresponding US and Japanese
companies was not prepared or well written, there would be
a risk of underreporting to the FAERS and vice versa.
Thus, different regulatory orientations would lead to different data content with the same data structure. Regardless
of globally accepted standards for reporting, differences in
contents of case reports are inevitable across countries, causing deviations in spontaneous reporting system databases.
Both databases would benefit from technical support
for handling substance names that are recorded in different
formats between the FAERS and JADER. Substance name
is core information, and it must be identical; however, differences across the regulatory spontaneous reporting system databases remain an unresolved issue. How to handle

ambiguous substance names in text or to retrieve names from
product information, the substance level/category to be used
for analysis, and AE names and levels are important factors
for quantitative analysis using drug-event combinations.
Unfortunately, it would be difficult for users of the two
databases to avoid duplicate reports, given that multiple companies may report the same case while identifying different
medicines as the primary suspected drug. ICH-standardized
reporting theoretically can identify “the same case” by using
the regulatory authority’s case report number, other sender’s
case report number, or other case identifiers in previous transmissions. However, none of these numbers, except for the
other sender’s case report number, were provided by either
agency. Many studies on electronic health records discuss
how duplicates can be identified using patient sex, age,
administered drugs, date of administration, and other factors.
However, no consensus has been reached on a standardized
or recommended method. It also remains uncertain as to
how many reports were common between the FAERS and
JADER; similar to duplication related issues, it would be
most helpful to identify the same case between the FAERS
and JADER. In the current situation without identifiers, anonymized patient information and vague product information
make identifying cases difficult. As a result, based on their
publicity policy, database users cannot currently eliminate
duplicates or overlap cases between databases.

Signals of disproportionate reporting
Between the JP and FAERS-JP, the numbers of signals identified through the three methods were different. Bias exists
due to subjective decisions in the selection, data mining procedure algorithm, and output selection, system deployment
and interpretation, as discussed by Hauben et al,22 this study
reconfirmed that the generalizability of results of statistical
analyses on spontaneous reporting system data is affected by
spontaneous reporting system data. Database profiles, such
as reported substances and AEs, could be responsible for
this difference. Therefore, this study considered adjustment
options resulting in greater similarity in signal detection
between the JP and FAERS-JP by conducting sensitivity
analysis. Due to limited options of variables, only reporterrestricted signal detection was applied to two datasets for
stratification; however, it did not have a significant effect
on either dataset. This study also attempted to examine the
use of case seriousness and AE seriousness at the individual
level, but no such variable was available.
When using the GPS method, the total number of signals in
the JP and FAERS-JP was similar for etanercept, infliximab,

and paroxetine hydrochloride. Common signals were limited,
which is not surprising when using different databases;
however, GPS showed the best homogeneity between the
two datasets. The results did not fully support the notion that
country-specific cases in the FAERS and cases in a national
spontaneous reporting system database such as the JADER
would be mutually referenced for signal detection, and this
certainly deserves increased attention. Nonetheless, the ratios
of common GPS signals ranged between 40% and 60% among
the JP and FAERS-JP; these GPS signals, as referenced by
Japanese labeling, showed high positive sensitivity. This may
be illuminating for global companies to plan worldwide risk
management, eg, updating product information.

Limitations
This study investigated datasets of the spontaneous reporting system databases of just two countries. This study did
not include the Vigibase® because it does not have a sufficient number of Japanese cases.1 This may be an option for
comparisons between other countries. There are limitations
in demonstrating the association between variances in regulations and databases. Spontaneous reporting system databases
mostly depend on the compliance of pharmaceutical companies’ reporting with regulatory requirements. However,
each company has its own operational rules for AE reports,
which makes it impossible for researchers to validate contents
of spontaneous reporting system databases. Therefore, this
paper is just one example for reference. Further, bias likely
exists relative to the targeted year, which was 2010. Different results may emerge when exploring across other years.
With regard to drugs examined by signal detection, selection
bias would exist. For example, a gap between the two datasets was observed among the ratio of signals to drug-event
combinations. This rough trend is similar to the description
in the report by the Japanese regulatory body, providing the
ratios of signals to the total drug-event combination numbers
in the JADER as of September 2005, which was 6.4% for
the GPS.23 However, the number of common signals identified by the GPS (545 of 1,547 drug-event combinations, or
35.2%)18 differs from the results of this study. This may be
also due to substance selection and the limited targeted year
of reporting.
While signal detection methodology is an important
issue, it was not discussed in detail in this paper. Studies on
its development and application have been encouraged elsewhere. ROR as used in this study is a rather simple formula
used by regulatory authorities.18,21 Rothman et al suggested
that ROR could be more appropriate than the proportional
reporting ratio for spontaneous reporting data enabling early
3040

detection.24 As described by others,18,19 ROR identifies more
signals for each substance than do the Bayesian methods,
and it was consistent among the datasets. The two Bayesian
methods, GPS and BCPNN, are considered useful because
each detects unique signals even when there are few AE
reports on a certain drug. This study likewise demonstrated
that BCPNN and GPS identified fewer signals than did
ROR for the three selected substances. Yet, signal detection
findings were altered by analysis methods and by database
characteristics. A proposal has been made elsewhere to
interrelate ROR and other methods with a new parameter,25
and there certainly remains room for close examination with
various measures to elaborate upon application of signals of
disproportionate reporting.
There are limitations and biases in this study, and we
showed that impact assessment of spontaneous reporting
system databases for signals of disproportionate reporting
remains unsatisfactory. As a result, global companies need to
consider spontaneous reporting system databases for countryspecific issues. That said, this study will help individuals
concerned with pharmacovigilance to better understand
the use and pitfalls of using spontaneous reporting system
databases and their signal generation. It is important to bear
these in mind for pharmacovigilance and risk assessment
for drug safety.

Conclusion
The FAERS-JP differed in its detected signals from the JP.
Signals derived from both datasets identified different results,
but shared certain signals. Discrepancies in AE types, drugs
reported, and average number of AEs per case were potential
contributing factors. This study will help individuals concerned with pharmacovigilance to better understand the use
and pitfalls of using spontaneous AE data.
