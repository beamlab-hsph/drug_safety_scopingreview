Abstract
Background and Objective While risk of acute kidney
injury (AKI) is a well documented adverse effect of some
drugs, few studies have assessed the relationship between
drug–drug interactions (DDIs) and AKI. Our objective was
to develop an algorithm capable of detecting potential
signals on this relationship by retrospectively mining data
from electronic health records.
Material and methods Data were extracted from the
clinical data warehouse (CDW) of the Hôpital Européen
Georges Pompidou (HEGP). AKI was defined as the first
level of the RIFLE criteria, that is, an increase C50 % of
creatinine basis. Algorithm accuracy was tested on 20
single drugs, 10 nephrotoxic and 10 non-nephrotoxic. We
then tested 45 pairs of non-nephrotoxic drugs, among the

most prescribed at our hospital and representing distinct
pharmacological classes for DDIs.
Results Sensitivity and specificity were 50 % [95 %
confidence interval (CI) 23.66–76.34] and 90 % (95 % CI
59.58–98.21), respectively, for single drugs. Our algorithm
confirmed a previously identified signal concerning clarithromycin and calcium-channel blockers (unadjusted odds
ratio (ORu) 2.92; 95 % CI 1.11–7.69, p = 0.04). Among
the 45 drug pairs investigated, we identified a signal concerning 55 patients in association with bromazepam and
hydroxyzine (ORu 1.66; 95 % CI 1.23–2.23). This signal
was not confirmed after a chart review. Even so, AKI and
co-prescription were confirmed for 96 % (95 % CI 88–99)
and 88 % (95 % CI 76–94) of these patients, respectively.
Conclusion Data mining techniques on CDW can foster
the detection of adverse drug reactions when drugs are used
alone or in combination.

Key Points
The re-use of data from electronic health records
(EHRs) generated by real clinical activities for
pharmacoepidemiological studies is booming; it
seemed that drug–drug interactions (DDIs) could be
identified by mining such databases.
We have developed a new signal detection algorithm
using data mining techniques and the RIFLE criteria
that is able to re-use real care data from EHRs in
order to identify potential pharmacovigilance signals
concerning DDIs and acute kidney injury.
This study confirms that real care data from EHRs
could be utilized to identify new pharmacovigilance
signals concerning DDIs.

1 Introduction
Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) can result either from the
prescription of a single drug or from the prescription of a
combinations of drugs (CADRs), considered a special class
of drug–drug interactions (DDIs). A DDI, in a larger sense,
can also be defined as a clinically significant alteration in
the effect of one drug, as a consequence of co-administration of another drug [1]. While most ADRs can be
expected and hence can be avoided, CADRs are highly
complex to identify and, as a consequence, are not well
studied. CADRs could represent 6–30 % of unexpected
adverse drug effects [2].
Spontaneous reporting systems (SRS) are very reliable
data sources for early detection of rare ADRs in post-marketing surveillance. However, at least three limitations of
SRS are well known. First, most ADRs are under-reported in
SRS, especially those already known or less serious; the
median under-reporting rate was estimated at 94 % in a
systematic review in 2006 [3]. Second, some ADRs can be
over-reported, especially those highlighted by media. Third,
SRS do not allow the calculation of a true incidence rate
because of the lack of precise knowledge on the exact
number of patients exposed to a drug. These difficulties are
even greater for DDIs as the number of reports is lower. A
high potential approach involves reusing data collected and
stored in electronic health records (EHRs), either directly or
through mining a clinical data warehouse (CDW) derived
from EHRs. It then becomes possible to identify, confirm, or
refute pharmacovigilance signals coming from an adverse
event reporting system database [4, 5] or eventually directly
suggest new ADRs [6–9]. The combination of these methods
could finally decrease the time-consuming and financial cost
of ADR detection for the community [10].
Methods and tools, known as data mining, have been
developed over the years to analyse large sets of data. Data
mining methods in pharmacovigilance have been used with
several goals [8, 9]: (1) in order to automate the search of
publications concerning ADRs in Medline [11]; (2) to
correlate and predict post-marketing adverse drug effects
based on screening data from public databases of chemical
structures like Pubchem [12]; (3) to develop new algorithms to detect new or latent multi-drug adverse events in
adverse event reporting system databases [5]; and (4) to
find out new pharmacovigilance signals by mining EHR
data [13, 14]. For example, in a recently published work,
Tatonetti et al. [13] confirmed a potential signal from the
Food and Drug Administration’s Adverse Event Reporting
System, between diabetes mellitus and co-prescription of
paroxetine, a selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor, and
pravastatin, a cholesterol-lowering agent, by using data
from EHRs. It was the first time that real-life care data

Y. Girardeau et al.

constrained in EHRs were used in order to confirm a
potential signal regarding DDIs.
We paid particular attention to a frequent adverse effect
of drugs—acute kidney injury (AKI). Nephrotoxic drugs
are involved in 19–25 % of the cases of severe acute renal
failure in critically ill patients [15, 16]. Although there is
still no total consensual definition of AKI, the RIFLE criteria is one of the most used and well defined tools [17, 18]
and is primarily considered in our study because of its high
sensitivity and specificity and independent association with
morbidity and mortality [19, 20]. Although the association
between AKI and some classes of drugs (such as
antiretroviral drugs, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs,
angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, aminoglycosides) are well known and therefore can be expected and
hence avoided, to date, only a few studies have investigated
the association between AKI and DDIs [21–24].
The objective of this study was to develop a new signal
detection algorithm using data mining techniques, RIFLE
criteria and real care data from EHR in order to identify
potential pharmacovigilance signals concerning CADRs
and AKI.

2 Material and Methods
2.1 Study Site and Settings
The Hôpital Européen Georges Pompidou (HEGP) is a
teaching hospital with 24 clinical departments and 795 beds.
Since 2011, HEGP has provided its researchers with a CDW,
a database that collects all information from the EHRs generated by clinical activities since its opening in 2000 [25, 26].
Thirteen years of health data collection from 606,524 different patients, including patients’ history, demographics,
diagnosis, symptoms, drug treatments, clinical laboratory
and image results, ICD-10 codes and full-text inpatient and
outpatient reports, all made available for research. Demographic data, drug prescriptions, lab values and ICD-10
billing codes were extracted to conduct this study.
2.2 Study Design
We conducted a retrospective observational study based on
HEGP’s EHR data in three steps (Fig. 1).
2.2.1 Step One Concerns the Selection of Eligible Patients
According to Their Clinical Context
Patients had to have at least two serum creatinine levels
and one electronic prescription to be included. Patients who
had been hospitalized in intensive care units were not
included since these units were not on the electronic

Fig. 1 We chose to assess the association between acute kidney injury (AKI) and the co-prescription of ten drugs, representing 45 drug pairs,
among the most prescribed at the Hôpital Européen Georges Pompidou (HEGP). The pharmacovigilance unit of HEGP provided a list of 393
nephrotoxic drugs that were related to AKI at least once in the literature (http://www.biourtox.com/Mediquick7/index.cfm). We chose drugs that
were not on the list and that represented different drug classes (see electronic supplementary material 1). All relevant data were extracted from
our electronic health records. For each pair of drugs, we compared two cohorts: a cohort with patients on drug 1 but not drug 2 or drug 2 but not
drug 1 and a cohort with patients on both drugs. EHR electronic health records

prescription system at the time of the study. We excluded
patients who had an obvious cause of AKI such as patients
under antineoplasic agents, patients with cardiogenic,
hemorrhagic, septic, traumatic and anaphylactic shock
diagnosis. We also excluded patients under dialysis since
variations of creatinine could not be related to the prescription or co-prescription. We used ICD-10 billing codes
to define the patients to exclude.
2.2.2 Step Two Concerns the Selection of Patients Under
Drug Treatment
For each pair of drugs tested, three cohorts were extracted
from our CDW: (1) patients with co-prescription of two
drugs; (2) patients prescribed drug 1 but not drug 2, (3)
patients prescribed drug 2 but not drug 1. In all cases,
patients could also have been on other medications. These
drugs were administered orally or parenterally; topical
forms were not considered. We aggregated all drugs with
the same International Nonproprietary Name (INN)
regardless of doses.
2.2.3 Step Three Concerns the Defining of AKI and Drug
Exposure

creatinine value measurement within 30 days after the
beginning of the prescription or the co-prescription [28].
The beginning of exposure to drug 1 or 2 was defined as the
first start date of prescription present in our CDW. The start
of the co-prescription was defined as the first start date of
drug 2 while the patient was already on drug 1 (Fig. 2).
Therefore, in our model, patients in each cohort had to be
at least under a defined drug prescription in order to differentiate ‘base creatinine’ and ‘treatment creatinine’ and,
therefore, identify an AKI related to a drug prescription.
We included patients regardless of which drug was
prescribed first (i.e., drug pairs 1–2 and 2–1 were processed
the same way).
As we worked only with start-date prescriptions,
regardless of end-date prescriptions, we checked that
patients had a start date of the first drug within 7 days
before the start date of the second drug, to be sure of a
genuine co-prescription.
We created an algorithm based on the first level of the
RIFLE criteria to indentify whether or not patients had an
AKI [17]. We considered an AKI as an increase of at least
50 % from baseline creatinine within 30 days after the start
of the prescription or the co-prescription [20].
2.3 Validation Tests of the Algorithm

We estimated the baseline creatinine as an outpatient serum
creatinine level measured within the past 3 months before
the prescription of drug 1 or drug 2 or both [27, 28]. The
treatment creatinine was defined as the highest serum

In a first step to validate our method, we tested ten drugs
that were not on a list of 393 nephrotoxic drugs (Table 1)
and ten drugs that were on this list (Table 2). Selected

highest serum creatinine value measurement within the 30 days after the beginning of the prescription or the co-prescription [28]. The start of the

drugs were chosen from the most prescribed during the
study period and had to represent different drug classes.
We took patients under vitamin D oral solution as controls,
a drug that is unknown, to date, to induce AKI.
Then, to test our method on DDIs, we aimed to identify
an association between co-prescription of clarithromycin
and calcium channel blockers (CCBs),as this association
has been highlighted in a recently published study to be at
risk of inducing AKI [23]. For this purpose, all HEGPprescribed CCBs have been pooled in the same cohort.
2.4 Drug–Drug Interaction Concerned Two-by-Two
Combined Drug Administration and Acute
Kidney Injury (AKI)
We chose to assess the association between AKI and all 45
drug pairs combined with ten drugs unknown, to date, to
induce AKI and picked from the most prescribed at HEGP
(see electronic supplementary material 1) for the time
period of the study. The ten drugs we selected were not on
the list of 393 nephrotoxic drugs and represented different
drug classes.

2.5 Chart Review Method
Two senior physicians from the pharmacovigilance
department conducted a chart review for patients under
drug pairs for which we had a signal. For each patient
record, pharmacologist experts had to (1) confirm the
existence of an AKI; (2) confirm the existence of a genuine co-prescription; and (3) find out other causes of AKI,
such as nephrotoxic drug co-prescriptions, injection of
iodinated contrast media, multiple organ failure, and so
forth. A nephrologist was in charge to analyse unobvious
cases.
2.6 Additional Analysis
We conducted several additional analyses for the drug pairs
for which we had a signal: (1) the impact of the prescription order; (2) different time intervals (3, 5 and 7 days)
between the start of co-prescription and AKI; and (3) the
mean of concomitant nephrotoxic prescriptions per patient
between patients under co-prescription and patients under
single drugs.

2.7 Statistical Methods
For the validation test, we estimated sensitivity, specificity,
predictive positive value, predictive negative value and the
Yule’s Q contingency coefficient of the algorithm.
Then we conducted a logistic regression model to
evaluate the association between AKI and co-prescription.
For this purpose, we compared two cohorts (Fig. 2): a
cohort with people who had drug 1 but not drug 2 or drug 2
but not drug 1 and a cohort with people on both drugs,
assuming that patients under one or the other drug would
be closer in terms of potential confounding factors than
patients with any other drugs.
In a first step, we tested the association with AKI for
each pair of drugs by a Chi-squared test. The aim was to
ensure that the possible association was well related to the
co-prescription and not to the effect of potential confounding factors specifically associated with one of the
drugs, for we previously pooled patients under drug 1 or 2
in a single cohort. If there was a significant difference
between the two drugs, we would abort our investigations
(see electronic supplementary material 2). For each patient,
age, sex, number of prescriptions at the maximum creatinine level, baseline creatinine and time period between
the start date of (co-)prescription were used as covariates.
Age, number of prescriptions, baseline creatinine and time
period were coded as continuous variables, others as
binary.
The logistic regression model was defined as follows:
Logit ðIRAÞ ¼ b0 þ b1 drug 1 and 2=drug1 xor 2
þ b2 age þ b3 sex
þ b4 baseline creatinine
þ b5 number of precriptions
þ b6 time period:

The number of prescriptions, at the date of the treatment
creatinine, ignored saline, glucose infusions and topical
form medications.
An Open Database Connection (ODBC) linking an
OracleÒ database (11g Enterprise Edition Release
11.2.0.1.0) of i2b2 CDW (version 1.3) to R software
(version 2.15.3) was set up. The extraction of data was
performed with SQL queries then R was used for all the
analysis (RODBC, stats, MASS and epitools packages).
We used the false discovery rate control method to correct
multiple comparisons.
We obtained approval from the institutional review board
of our hospital (IRB#00001072 Study #CDW_2013_0004).

3 Results
3.1 Data Mining and Clinical Screening of Patient
Cohorts
We extracted data from 606,524 patients from July 2000 to
June 2013 from the HEGP CDW [25, 26]. Of these patients,
88,687 patients had at least two serum creatinine levels and
one electronic prescription. We excluded patients who had
an obvious cause of creatinine variation, that is, 12,620
patients with at least one ICD-10 billing code for shocks or
antineoplastic agents or dialysis. Finally, 76,067 patients
were included in this study (Fig. 3).
3.2 Testing our Algorithm on Pairwise Single

drugs known to cause AKI and (2) ten drugs not known to
cause AKI. Vitamin D oral solution was considered as a
control.
3.2.1 AKI and Non-Nephrotoxic Drugs
Among the ten drugs not known to cause AKI, we didn’t
find any association with AKI for all drugs except for

To assess our method on DDIs, we first tested a pair of
drugs that was already known to be associated with AKI:
clarithromycin and CCBs [23]. We found a statistically
significant association between AKI and this co-prescription by re-using our healthcare data (ORu 2.92; 95 % CI
1.11–7.69, p = 0.04).
To identify new pharmacovigilance signals concerning
DDIs, we investigated 45 pairs of drugs that could be
formed with ten drugs we selected among the most prescribed at HEGP (see electronic supplementary material 1).
Only 27 pairs of drugs were eligible for comparison after a
Chi square test (see methods section and electronic supplementary material 2). Considering the unadjusted odds
ratio, the co-prescription of one pair of drugs was associated with AKI: hydroxyzine and bromazepam (ORu 1.66;
95 % CI 1.23–2.23, ARI 3.70 %; 95 % CI 1.39–6.52, NNH
27) (Table 3).

Detection of Drug–Drug Interactions Inducing Acute Kidney Injury

3.4 Study of Covariates
We conducted a covariates study for people under
hydroxyzine and/or bromazepam. We tested age, sex, base
creatinine, number of concomitant prescriptions and time
period to AKI (Table 4). Three covariates were significantly associated with AKI in a univariate analysis: age
(p = 6.93e-06), number of concomitant prescriptions
(p = 1.01e-07) and time period (p \ 2e-16). OR adjusted for these three covariates was 1.47 (95 % CI
1.07–1.99).
3.5 Testing for a Potential Class Effect
Four other benzodiazepines were prescribed at HEGP:
alprazolam, diazepam, lorazepam and oxazepam. We tested each one of them in association with hydroxyzine but
did not find any significant association with AKI after
multiple testing correction (p = 1, 0.72, 1, and 0.24,
respectively). The result was equivalent when we pooled
patients with all benzodiazepines but bromazepam
(p = 0.68). We only tested for hydroxyzine as it is the only
representative of its ATC drug class.
3.6 Additional Analysis
We tested the impact of the prescription order and discovered
a difference: the association was present when bromazepam
was prescribed first (1.77; 95 % CI 1.24–2.54, p = 0.003)
but not when hydroxyzine was also first (1.21; 95 % CI
0.73–2.00, p = 0.49). Next we tested the association
between AKI and hydroxyzine and bromazepam concomitant prescriptions for different time intervals: 3, 5 and 7 days
between the start of co-prescription and serum creatinine
levels of interest, and did not find any association (p = 0.44,
0.16 and 0.13, respectively). We tested the assumption that
nephrotoxic drugs will be equally distributed between prescription and co-prescription cohorts. The mean of concomitant nephrotoxic prescriptions was not statistically
different between patients under hydroxyzine or bromazepam alone (mean 5.76) and patients under both drugs
(mean 4.82) (p = 0.089).
3.7 Chart Review
To further our investigations on the potential signal concerning hydroxyzine and bromazepam, the records of 56
patients who were under this co-prescription and had an
AKI were reviewed by two senior physicians from the
pharmacovigilance department. The diagnoses of AKI had
been confirmed for 96 % (95 % CI 88–99) of cases
(n = 54); in one case, the baseline creatinine level was
artificially low due to hyperhydration, this elevation of

805

creatinine was in fact a normalisation. The concomitant
prescription was confirmed for 88 % (95 % CI 76–94) of
cases (n = 49). All patients had another cause of AKI:
renal causes, including functional renal failure (n = 20),
other drugs (n = 15), mixed causes (clinical status, drugs
and functional renal failure) (n = 15), infection (n = 3). A
nephrologist analysed three unobvious cases that were
finally classified as mixed causes.

4 Discussion
Identification of new DDIs is a major public health concern. While SRS is not suitable for the identification of new
DDIs, the secondary use of clinical data, collected in EHRs
to identify new signals for DDIs, is promising. We created
an algorithm capable of extracting EHR data and identifying an association between concomitant prescriptions
and AKI. AKI was identified using real laboratory data and
defined by the first level of RIFLE criteria for each patient
and each drug and drug pair tested [18]. As ADRs of single
drugs are better known, we first tested our algorithm on
single drug pairs and were able to identify signals concerning drugs known to be nephrotoxic with quite good
accuracy (sensitivity: 50 %; 95 % CI 23.66–76.34%,
specificity: 90 %; 95 % CI 59.58–98.21). The lack of
sensitivity could have resulted from an indication bias
since nephrotoxic drugs are prescribed very carefully to
people with poor kidney function. However, such
exploratory studies often suffer from a lack of specificity
induced by the oversized number of false positive signals.
Increasing the sensitivity of the method could have resulted
in a lack of specificity which was not desirable for the
second step of the study.
In order to test our algorithm on DDIs, we investigated
clarithromycin and CCB concomitant prescriptions which
were associated recently with higher risk of hospitalization
with AKI (OR = 1.98; 95 % CI 1.68–2.34) [23]. We
identified a significant statistical association between coprescription of these drugs and AKI (ORu 2.92; 95 % CI
1.11–7.69, p = 0.04). By investigating all drug pairs
formed with ten drugs chosen among the most prescribed
in our hospital, we identified a potential signal linking comedication of hydroxyzine and bromazepam with AKI
(ORu 2.23; 95 % CI 1.57–3.16; OR 1.47; 95 % CI
1.07–1.99). This signal was not confirmed by a class effect
study, different onset time and a chart review. Although
other plausible causes of AKI have been detected for all
patients, chart review confirmed an effective AKI in 98 %
(95 % CI 88–99) of cases, and concomitant prescriptions in
88 % (95 % CI 76–94) of cases. For pharmacovigilance,
these results are extremely encouraging, with the secondary
use of the real-world care data contained in EHR. The main

AKI acute kidney injury

purpose of the present study was not to formally identify a
relationship between tested co-prescriptions and AKI but to
provide a new tool for the identification of potential cases
for pharmacovigilance hospital units. This work could be
the first step for further studies on the detection of DDIs
concerning co-medications of more than two drugs,
detection of over-DDIs or to develop EHR alarm systems
for drugs that have been recently marketed.

4.1 Start Date of Therapy and Beginning
of Exposure
As the only source of data used came from our hospital
database, we had no information regarding prescription
outside the hospital. Thus, if the first prescription occurred
before hospitalization, the beginning of exposure could be
potentially confused with a simple renewal of treatment.

Detection of Drug–Drug Interactions Inducing Acute Kidney Injury

To reduce this bias, we should have manually analysed
each patient’s record to trace any previous exposure before
hospitalization. It would have been possible to analyse a
few drug pairs but not in a data mining situation where the
aim is to analyse the largest number of drug pairs as possible. This bias has already been discussed for such studies
but it would tend to minimize the signal and therefore
reduce the detection capability of the algorithm [13].
4.2 Concomitant Nephrotoxic Prescriptions
In all studied cases, patients of each cohort could be on
another prescription. In our first analysis, we tried to
exclude patients on concomitant nephrotoxic treatment
from the list of 393 nephrotoxic drugs. Unfortunately, the
loss of many patients made the analysis no longer feasible.
We finally chose to keep concomitant potential nephrotoxic
drugs as we accepted the hypothesis that they should be
equally distributed in each cohort.
This hypothesis was reasonable since there was no
reason to think that a nephrotoxic drug could be associated
with a co-prescription rather than the single medications
tested. Furthermore, there was no significant difference
(p = 0.089) between the mean of concomitant nephrotoxic
drug prescriptions per patient in the cohorts of hydroxyzine
or bromazepam alone and hydroxyzine and bromazepam in
association.
4.3 Iodinated Contrast Media
AKI is a classical adverse effect of iodinated contrast
media. Unfortunately, we were not able to exclude patients
who underwent an injection of iodinated contrast media as
their prescriptions were not recorded in our CDW. We
accepted a similar hypothesis to that used with concomitant
prescription of nephrotoxic drugs. There was no reason to
think that there were more patients under iodinated contrast
media in the co-prescription cohort than in the single prescription cohort.
4.4 Limitations of Data Mining in a Retrospective
Observational Study
Our objective was to analyse the largest possible number of
drug pairs. Hence, we could not achieve a traditional
covariate analysis. For exploratory purposes, we restricted
our analysis to five relevant factors: age, sex, baseline
creatinine, number of concomitant prescriptions and time
period between start date of prescription and maximum
creatinine level [20]. We chose to test our covariates only
for relevant drug pairs in order to avoid over-adjustment
bias. Moreover, in this first phase of the analysis, a comprehensive analysis of all the potential confounding factors

807

would have introduced too much complexity for a proper
interpretation.
4.5 AKI and Serum Creatinine Base Definitions
We chose to work with the RIFLE classification as it is
currently one of the most consensual for epidemiologic
research [17, 18]. These criteria can detect AKI with high
sensitivity and specificity and are independently associated
with morbidity and mortality [19, 20]. One of the limitations of this classification is the definition of the baseline
serum creatinine level. Few definitions have been proposed
in the literature and all resulted in misclassifications [20].
Baseline serum creatinine level should be representative of
the normal renal function; an outpatient serum creatinine
level measured within the past 3 months was proposed by
Ricci et al. in 2011 [18]. We chose to work with the nearest
outpatient serum creatinine level before the beginning of
prescription or co-prescription in a 3-month timeframe.
The relevance of this choice was confirmed by the chart
review results, where 98 % of the relevant cases had a
confirmed AKI.
4.6 Time Period Between the Inclusion and the End
of Follow-Up
Definition of a timeframe within which the increase of
serum creatinine occurs is another issue of the RIFLE
classification. The Acute Dialysis Quality Initiative
(ADQI) [17] chose a 1-week window; but some patients,
with slowly progressive AKI, could be misidentified with
this too-short timeframe [20]. The onset time of acute renal
failure following a drug prescription is highly variable
from one drug to another; it goes from 1 h for nifedipine (a
CCB) to 30 years for lithium (a mood stabilizer) (http://
www.biourtox.com/Mediquick7/index.cfm). We retained a
30-day window that seemed a sufficient amount of time to
allow acute renal failure to occur and short enough to limit
various confounding factors. This arbitrary choice should
not have influenced the results since the median time period between (co-)prescription and the maximum creatinine
level was 2.4 days for hydroxyzine or bromazepam and
2.5 days for the combination cohort.
4.7 Patient Selection and Prescription
The selection of a particular drug causes the selection of a
particular patient. Hence, antihypertensive agents select
hypertensive patients, hypoglycemic drugs select diabetics
and patients on both drugs will be at greater risk to have a
diabetic nephropathy and to develop an episode of acute
renal failure. Thus, our results show that patients receiving
physiological saline were more at risk to develop an

808

episode of acute renal failure than patients receiving folic
acid. An assumption could be that patients requiring perfusion are weaker than patients who do not and are therefore more likely to develop AKI during their
hospitalization. Similarly, loperamide, an opioid drug used
against diarrhoea, was closed to trigger a signal; hypovolemia caused by gastrointestinal fluid losses could be an
explanation for this outcome. This selection bias has to be
questioned for every pair of drugs and it is a problem in any
epidemiological study, namely the existence of a causal
relationship.

5 Conclusion
We developed a new data-mining algorithm capable of
detecting potential signals concerning DDIs and AKI by
mining data from EHRs. We confirmed a previously found
association concerning concomitant prescription of clarithromycin and CCBs, and AKI. This work confirms the
EHR’s data re-using potential from a pharmacovigilance
perspective.
