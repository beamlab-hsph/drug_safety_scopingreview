Leveraging Case Narratives to Enhance Patient Age Ascertainment from Adverse Event Reports,"Pham, P.; Cheng, C.; Wu, E.; Kim, I.; Zhang, R.; Ma, Y.; Kortepeter, C. M.; Muñoz, M. A.","INTRODUCTION: Missing age presents a significant challenge when evaluating individual case safety reports (ICSRs) in the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS). When age is missing in an ICSR's structured field, it may be in the report's free-text narrative. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to evaluate the performance and assess the potential impact of a rule-based natural language processing (NLP) tool that utilizes a text string search to identify patients' numerical age from unstructured narratives. METHODS: Using FAERS ICSRs from 2002 to 2018, we evaluated the annual proportion of ICSRs with age missing in the structured field before and after NLP application. Reviewers manually identified patients' age from ICSR narratives (gold standard) from a random sample of 1500 ICSRs. The gold standard was compared to the NLP-identified age. RESULTS: During the study period, the percentage of ICSRs missing age in the structured field increased from 21.9 to 43.8%. The NLP tool performed well among the random sample: sensitivity 98.5%, specificity 92.9%, positive predictive value (PPV) 94.9%, and F-measure 96.7%. It also performed well for the subset of ICSRs missing age in the structured field; when applied to these cases, NLP identified age for an additional one million ICSRs (10% of the total number of ICSRs from 2002 to 2018) and decreased the percentage of ICSRs missing age to 27% overall. CONCLUSIONS: NLP has potential utility to extract patients' age from ICSR narratives. Use of this tool would enhance pharmacovigilance and research using FAERS data.",2021,Sep 2,Pharmaceut Med,,,,34476768,10.1007/s40290-021-00398-5,,#4171,Pham 2021,Exclusion reason: Lack of Machine Learning; ,""
Using real-world healthcare data for pharmacovigilance signal detection-the experience of the EU-ADR project,"Patadia, V. K.; Coloma, P.; Schuemie, M. J.; Herings, R.; Gini, R.; Mazzaglia, G.; Picelli, G.; Fornari, C.; Pedersen, L.; Van Der Lei, J.; Sturkenboom, M.; Trifirò, G.","A prospective pharmacovigilance signal detection study, comparing the real-world healthcare data (EU-ADR) and two spontaneous reporting system (SRS) databases, US FDA's Adverse Event Reporting System and WHO's Vigibase is reported. The study compared drug safety signals found in the EU-ADR and SRS databases. The potential for signal detection in the EU-ADR system was found to be dependent on frequency of the event and utilization of drugs in the general population. The EU-ADR system may have a greater potential for detecting signals for events occurring at higher frequency in general population and those that are commonly not considered as potentially a drug-induced event.

"Pneumocystis pneumonia in patients with rheumatic diseases receiving prolonged, non-high-dose steroids-clinical implication of primary prophylaxis using trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole","Park, J. W.; Curtis, J. R.; Kim, M. J.; Lee, H.; Song, Y. W.; Lee, E. B.","OBJECTIVES: To investigate the incidence of pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) and its risk factors in patients with rheumatic disease receiving non-high-dose steroid treatment, along with the risks and benefits of PCP prophylaxis. METHODS: This study included 28,292 treatment episodes with prolonged (≥ 4 weeks), non-high-dose steroids (low dose [< 15 mg/day, n = 27,227] and medium dose [≥ 15 to < 30 mg/day, n = 1065], based on prednisone) over a 14-year period. Risk factors for PCP and prophylactic effect of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) were investigated if the 1-year incidence rate (IR) of PCP in each dose group was > 0.1/100 person-years. Cox regression with LASSO was used for analysis. RESULTS: One-year PCP IR in the low-dose group was 0.01 (95% CI 0.001-0.03)/100 person-years, and only the medium-dose group showed eligible PCP IR for further analysis. In the medium-dose group, prophylactic TMP-SMX was administered in 45 treatment episodes while other episodes involved no prophylaxis (prophylaxis group vs. control group). In 1018.0 person-years, 5 PCP cases occurred exclusively in the control group, yielding an IR of 0.5 (0.2-1.2)/100 person-years. Concomitant steroid-pulse treatment and baseline lymphopenia were the most significant risk factors for PCP. Treatment episodes with at least one of these factors (n = 173, high-risk subgroup) showed higher 1-year PCP IR (3.4 (1.1-8.0)/100 person-years), while no PCP occurred in other treatment episodes. TMP-SMX numerically reduced the risk (adjusted HR = 0.2 (0.001-2.3)) in the high-risk subgroup. The IR of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) related to TMP-SMX was 41.5 (22.3-71.6)/100 person-years, including one serious ADR. The number needed to treat with TMP-SMX to prevent one PCP in the high-risk subgroup (31 (17-226)) was lower than the number needed to harm by serious ADR (45 (15-∞)). CONCLUSION: Incidence of PCP in patients with rheumatic diseases receiving prolonged, medium-dose steroids depends on the presence of risk factors. Prophylactic TMP-SMX may have greater benefit than potential risk in the high-risk subgroup.",2019,Sep 14,Arthritis Res Ther,21,1,207,31521185,10.1186/s13075-019-1996-6,,#5521,Park 2019,Exclusion reason: Prognostic Task; ,""

K.; Gazarian, M.; Bonhoeffer, J.; Sturkenboom, M.","Background: Better evidence regarding drug safety in the pediatric population might be generated from existing data sources such as spontaneous reporting systems and electronic healthcare records. The Global Research in Paediatrics (GRiP)–Network of Excellence aims to develop pediatric-specific methods that can be applied to these data sources. A reference set of positive and negative drug–event associations is required. Objective: The aim of this study was to develop a pediatric-specific reference set of positive and negative drug–event associations. Methods: Considering user patterns and expert opinion, 16 drugs that are used in individuals aged 0–18 years were selected and evaluated against 16 events, regarded as important safety outcomes. A cross-table of unique drug–event pairs was created. Each pair was classified as potential positive or negative control based on information from the drug’s Summary of Product Characteristics and Micromedex. If both information sources consistently listed the event as an adverse event, the combination was reviewed as potential positive control. If both did not, the combination was evaluated as potential negative control. Further evaluation was based on published literature. Results: Selected drugs include ibuprofen, flucloxacillin, domperidone, methylphenidate, montelukast, quinine, and cyproterone/ethinylestradiol. Selected events include bullous eruption, aplastic anemia, ventricular arrhythmia, sudden death, acute kidney injury, psychosis, and seizure. Altogether, 256 unique combinations were reviewed, yielding 37 positive (17 with evidence from the pediatric population and 20 with evidence from adults only) and 90 negative control pairs, with the remainder being unclassifiable.

Association between selective beta-adrenergic drugs and blood pressure elevation: Data mining of the Japanese adverse drug event report (JADER) database,"Ohyama, K.; Inoue, M.","Selective beta-adrenergic drugs are used clinically to treat various diseases. Because of imperfect receptor selectivity, beta-adrenergic drugs cause some adverse drug events by stimulating other adrenergic receptors. To examine the association between selective beta-adrenergic drugs and blood pressure elevation, we reviewed the Japanese Adverse Drug Event Reports (JADERs) submitted to the Japan Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency. We used the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) Preferred Terms extracted from Standardized MedDRA queries for hypertension to identify events related to blood pressure elevation. Spontaneous adverse event reports from April 2004 through May 2015 in JADERs, a data mining algorithm, and the reporting odds ratio (ROR) were used for quantitative signal detection, and assessed by the case/non-case method. Safety signals are considered significant if the ROR estimates and lower bound of the 95% confidence interval (CI) exceed 1. A total of 2021 reports were included in this study. Among the nine drugs examined, significant signals were found, based on the 95%CI for salbutamol (ROR: 9.94, 95% CI: 3.09-31.93) and mirabegron (ROR: 7.52, 95%CI: 4.89-11.55). The results of this study indicate that some selective beta-adrenergic drugs are associated with blood pressure elevation. Considering the frequency of their indications, attention should be paid to their use in elderly patients to avoid adverse events.",2016,,Yakugaku Zasshi,136,7,1065-1071,,10.1248/yakushi.15-00299,,#618,Ohyama 2016,Exclusion reason: Non-English; ,""
A new search method using association rule mining for drug-drug interaction based on spontaneous report system,"Noguchi, Y.; Ueno, A.; Otsubo, M.; Katsuno, H.; Sugita, I.; Kanematsu, Y.; Yoshida, A.; Esaki, H.; Tachi, T.; Teramachi, H.","Background: Adverse events (AEs) can be caused not only by one drug but also by the interaction between two or more drugs. Therefore, clarifying whether an AE is due to a specific suspect drug or drug-drug interaction (DDI) is useful information for proper use of drugs. Whereas previous reports on the search for drug-induced AEs with signal detection using spontaneous reporting systems (SRSs) are numerous, reports on drug interactions are limited. This is because in methods that use ""a safety signal indicator"" (signal), which is frequently used in pharmacovigilance, a huge number of combinations must be prepared when signal detection is performed, and each risk index must be calculated, which makes interaction search appear unrealistic. Objective: In this paper, we propose association rule mining (AR) using large dataset analysis as an alternative to the conventional methods (additive interaction model (AI) and multiplicative interaction model (MI)). Methods: The data source used was the Japanese Adverse Drug Event Report database. The combination of drugs for which the risk index is detected by the ""combination risk ratio (CR)"" as the target was assumed to be true data, and the accuracy of signal detection using the AR methods was evaluated in terms of sensitivity, specificity, Youden's index, F-score. Results: Our experimental results targeting Stevens-Johnson syndrome indicate that AR has a sensitivity of 99.05%, specificity of 92.60%, Youden's index of 0.917, F-score of 0.876, AI has a sensitivity of 95.62%, specificity of 96.92%, Youden's index of 0.925, and F-score of 0.924, and MI has a sensitivity of 65.46%, specificity of 98.78%, Youden's index of 0.642, and F-score of 0.771. This result was about the same level as or higher than the conventional method. Conclusions: If you use similar calculation methods to create combinations from the database, not only for SJS, but for all AEs, the number of combinations would be so enormous that it would be difficult to perform the calculations. However, in the AR method, the ""Apriori algorithm"" is used to reduce the number of calculations. Thus, the proposed method has the same detection power as the conventional methods, with the significant advantage that its calculation process is simple.",2018,,Frontiers in Pharmacology,9,MAR,,,10.3389/fphar.2018.00197,,#4987,Noguchi 2018,Exclusion reason: Lack of Machine Learning; ,""
Enhancing Prediction of Drug Indication and Side Effects through Named Entity Recognition and Jointly Learning of Syntactic Structures of Sentences,"Mohanapriya, D.; Beena, R.","The drug discovery process needs long time and cost to discover proper drug for treating the patients effectively. The unintended effects of drugs and the beneficial impact of drugs must be recognized because they may inflict severe patientâs injuries due to unforeseen acts of the produced candidate drugs. One of the effective techniques is text mining it can find the hidden relation between genes, diseases and drugs from the huge volume of data. Predict drug Indications and Side effects using TOpic modeling and Natural language processing (PISTON) was a text mining method which used to find the association between drug-disease and drug-side effects. Natural Language Processing (NLP) is used to identify words which relate association among drugs and genes from the sentences which are collected from literatures where words represent drugs and genes cooccurred. The relation between drugs and genes is represented through building drug-topic probability matrix by topic modeling. From the drug-topic probability matrix, the drugs for phenotypes can be identified by training a classifier for high-rank topics of drugs. It also predicted the association between drug and side effects. However, expressive power of named entities and their potential for enhancing the quality of discovered topics has not received much attention in PISTON. So in this paper, an Improved PISTON (IPISTON) is proposed which enhance the quality of discovered topics through named entity recognition system and inducing the syntactic structure from unannotated sentences. Initially, the sentences from the collected literature data are extracted and a dependency graph is constructed using NLP. After that, a Gene Regulation Score (GRS) of each sentence is calculated to define the relationship between gene and diseases. The topic modeling is enhanced by finding the biomedical entities in the biomedical repository using Conditional Random Field (CRF) and Bi-directional Long-Short Term Memory-CRF (BLSTM-CRF). CRF is a sequence modeling framework which finds the biomedical entities through the conditional probability distributions of biomedical entities on collected documents. BLSTM-CRF is a deep learning technique which is used to enhance the performance of CRF based named entity recognition. Moreover, the syntactic structure of sentences is calculated through syntactic distance measure. The syntactic structure, biomedical entities and the drug-topic probability matrix is given as input to CRF, BLSTM-CRF, Naïve Bayes, CART and Logistic for prediction of drug-phenotype and drug-side effects associations.",2020,,European Journal of Molecular and Clinical Medicine,7,6,170-176,,,,#2743,Mohanapriya 2020,Exclusion reason: Lack of Pharmacovigilance/Drug Safety; ,""
One stage versus two stages deep learning approaches for the extraction of drug-drug interactions from texts,"Miranda-Escalada, A.; Segura-Bedmar, I.","Drug-drug interactions (DDI) are a cause of adverse drug reactions. They occur when a drug has an impact on the effect of another drug. There is not a complete, up to date database where health care professionals can consult the interactions of any drug because most of the knowledge on DDI is hidden in unstructured text. In last years, deep learning has been succesfully applied to the extraction of DDI from texts, which requires the detection and later classification of DDI. Most of the deep learning systems for DDI extraction developed so far have addressed the detection and classification in one single step. In this study, we compare the performance of one-stage and two-stage architectures for DDI extraction. Our architectures are based on a bidirectional recurrent neural network layer composed of Gated Recurrent Units.

A Pattern Discovery Framework for Adverse Event Evaluation and Inference in Spontaneous Reporting Systems,"Markatou, M.; Ball, R.","Safety of medical products is a major public health concern. We present a critical discussion of the currently used analytical tools for mining spontaneous reporting systems (SRS) to identify safety signals after use of medical products. We introduce a pattern discovery framework for the analysis of SRS. The terminology 'pattern discovery' is borrowed from the engineering and artificial intelligence literature and signifies that the basis of the proposed framework is the medical case, formalizing the cognitive paradigm known to clinicians who evaluate individual patients and individual case safety reports submitted to SRS. The fundamental contribution of this approach is a strong probabilistic component that may account for selection and other biases and facilitates rigorous modeling and inference. We discuss somewhat in depth the concept of signal in pharmacovigilance and connect it with the concept of a pattern; we illustrate this conceptual framework using the example of anaphylaxis. Finally, we propose a research agenda in statistics, informatics, and pharmacovigilance practices needed to advance the pattern discovery framework in both the short and long terms.

Paediatric pharmacovigilance: use of pharmacovigilance data mining algorithms for signal detection in a safety dataset of a paediatric clinical study conducted in seven African countries,"Kajungu, D.

The commonest method used for discovering previously unknown safety risks is spontaneous notifications. In this study we examine the use of data mining algorithms to identify signals from adverse events reported in a phase IIIb/IV clinical trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of several Artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) for treatment of uncomplicated malaria in African children. METHODS: We used paediatric safety data from a multi-site, multi-country clinical study conducted in seven African countries (Burkina Faso, Gabon, Nigeria, Rwanda, Uganda, Zambia, and Mozambique). Each site compared three out of four ACTs, namely amodiaquine-artesunate (ASAQ), dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DHAPQ), artemether-lumefantrine (AL) or chlorproguanil/dapsone and artesunate (CD+A). We examine two pharmacovigilance signal detection methods, namely proportional reporting ratio and Bayesian Confidence Propagation Neural Network on the clinical safety dataset. RESULTS: Among the 4,116 children (6-59 months old) enrolled and followed up for 28 days post treatment, a total of 6,238 adverse events were reported resulting into 346 drug-event combinations. Nine signals were generated both by proportional reporting ratio and Bayesian Confidence Propagation Neural Network. A review of the manufacturer package leaflets, an online Multi-Drug Symptom/Interaction Checker (DoubleCheckMD) and further by therapeutic area experts reduced the number of signals to five. The ranking of some drug-adverse reaction pairs on the basis of their signal index differed between the two methods. CONCLUSIONS: Our two data mining methods were equally able to generate suspected signals using the pooled safety data from a phase IIIb/IV clinical trial.

An Alternative to Disproportionality: A Frequency-Based Method for Pharmacovigilance Data Mining,"Jokinen, J. D.; Lievano, F.; Scarazzini, L.; Truffa, M.","Background: Safety surveillance relies on mining of large pharmacovigilance (PV) databases to generate insights regarding the safe use of pharmaceutical products. The predominant approach to PV data mining involves computation of disproportionality scores for drug–adverse event (drug-AE) pairs. However, this approach requires a database to be sufficiently large, sufficiently diverse for the analysis to be reliably sensitive and specific, and fails to consider the particular safety profile of a product. Objective: The present study proposes and tests a novel, frequency-based approach to PV data mining that (1) leverages product knowledge and historical drug-AE trends and (2) imposes no requirement for the size and diversity of the database to which it is applied. Method: A focus group of physicians and scientists was convened to identify quantitative characteristics of data trends that they consider informative when reviewing counts of adverse events for products under surveillance. Feedback was transferred into a series of decision rules that, when applied to adverse event counts, identifies adverse event trends that are classified as Continuing Trend, Emerging Trend, or No Trend. Regression analyses are completed to verify the presence of a linear trend; and categorical measures of association completed to compare this frequency-based approach to disproportionality scores in a simulated database. Results: A significant, positive linear trend is present for the Continuing Trend and Emerging Trend categories (P <.0001). There is a significant association between trend categorizations and disproportionality scores (P <.0001). Conclusion: The proposed alternative frequency-based method for PV data mining would be useful where disproportionalities scores are not appropriate.

Adverse drug reaction or innocent bystander? A systematic comparison of statistical discovery methods for spontaneous reporting systems,"Dijkstra, L.; Garling, M.; Foraita, R.; Pigeot, I.","PURPOSE: Spontaneous reporting systems (SRSs) are used to discover previously unknown relationships between drugs and adverse drug reactions (ADRs). A plethora of statistical methods have been proposed over the years to identify these drug-ADR pairs. The objective of this study is to compare a wide variety of methods in their ability to detect these signals, especially when their detection is complicated by the presence of innocent bystanders (drugs that are mistaken to be associated with the ADR, since they are prescribed together with the drug that is the ADR's actual cause). METHODS: Twelve methods, 24 measures in total, ranging from simple disproportionality measures (eg, the reporting odds ratio), hypothesis tests (eg, test of the Poisson mean), Bayesian shrinkage estimates (eg, the Bayesian confidence propagation neural network, BCPNN) to sparse regression (LASSO), are compared in their ability to detect drug-ADR pairs in a large number of simulated SRSs with varying numbers of innocent bystanders and effect sizes. The area under the precision-recall curve is used to assess the measures' performance. RESULTS: Hypothesis tests (especially the test of the Poisson mean) perform best when the associations are weak and there is little to no confounding by other drugs. When the level of confounding increases and/or the effect sizes become larger, Bayesian shrinkage methods should be preferred. The LASSO proves to be the most robust against the innocent bystander effect. CONCLUSIONS: There is no absolute ""winner"".

Extracting Drug-Drug Interactions with Word and Character-Level Recurrent Neural Networks,"Kavuluru, R.; Rios, A.; Tran, T.","Drug-drug interactions (DDIs) are known to be responsible for nearly a third of all adverse drug reactions. Hence several current efforts focus on extracting signal from EMRs to prioritize DDIs that need further exploration. To this end, being able to extract explicit mentions of DDIs in free text narratives is an important task. In this paper, we explore recurrent neural network (RNN) architectures to detect and classify DDIs from unstructured text using the DDIExtraction dataset from the SemEval 2013 (task 9) shared task. Our methods are in line with those used in other recent deep learning efforts for relation extraction including DDI extraction. However, to our knowledge, we are the first to investigate the potential of character-level RNNs (Char-RNNs) for DDI extraction (and relation extraction in general). Furthermore, we explore a simple but effective model bootstrapping method to (a). build model averaging ensembles, (b). derive confidence intervals around mean micro-F scores (MMF), and (c). assess the average behavior of our methods. Without any rule based filtering of negative examples, a popular heuristic used by most earlier efforts, we achieve an MMF of 69.13. By adding simple replicable heuristics to filter negative instances we are able to achieve an MMF of 70.38. Furthermore, our best ensembles produce micro F-scores of 70.81 (without filtering) and 72.13 (with filtering), which are superior to metrics reported in published results.

A potential causal association mining algorithm for screening adverse drug reactions in postmarketing surveillance,"Ji, Y.; Ying, H.; Dews, P.; Mansour, A.; Tran, J.; Miller, R. E.; Massanari, R. M.","Early detection of unknown adverse drug reactions (ADRs) in postmarketing surveillance saves lives and prevents harmful consequences. We propose a novel data mining approach to signaling potential ADRs from electronic health databases. More specifically, we introduce potential causal association rules (PCARs) to represent the potential causal relationship between a drug and ICD-9 (CDC. (2010). International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9). [Online]. Available: http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/icd/icd9.html) coded signs or symptoms representing potential ADRs. Due to the infrequent nature of ADRs, the existing frequency-based data mining methods cannot effectively discover PCARs. We introduce a new interestingness measure, potential causal leverage, to quantify the degree of association of a PCAR. This measure is based on the computational, experience-based fuzzy recognition-primed decision (RPD) model that we developed previously (Y. Ji, R. M. Massanari, J. Ager, J. Yen, R. E. Miller, and H. Ying, ""A fuzzy logic-based computational recognition-primed decision model,"" Inf.

Klein, ""A recognition-primed decision making model of rapid decision making,"" in Decision Making in Action: Models and Methods, 1993, pp. 138-147). The potential causal leverage assesses the strength of the association of a drug-symptom pair given a collection of patient cases. To test our data mining approach, we retrieved electronic medical data for 16,206 patients treated by one or more than eight drugs of our interest at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Detroit between 2007 and 2009. We selected enalapril as the target drug for this ADR signal generation study. We used our algorithm to preliminarily evaluate the associations between enalapril and all the ICD-9 codes associated with it. The experimental results indicate that our approach has a potential to better signal potential ADRs than risk ratio and leverage, two traditional frequency-based measures. Among the top 50 signal pairs (i.e., enalapril versus symptoms) ranked by the potential causal-leverage measure, the physicians on the project determined that eight of them probably represent true causal associations.",2011,May,IEEE Trans Inf Technol Biomed,15,3,428-437,21435986,10.1109/titb.2011.2131669,,#5575,Ji 2011,Exclusion reason: Lack of Machine Learning; ,""

These unanticipated episodes are usually unexpected and infrequent, which makes existing data mining techniques, mainly designed to find frequent patterns, ineffective. In this paper, we propose unexpected temporal association rules (UTARs) to describe them. To handle the unexpectedness, we introduce a new interestingness measure, residual-leverage, and develop a novel case-based exclusion technique for its calculation. Combining it with an event-oriented data preparation technique to handle the infrequency, we develop a new algorithm MUTARC to find pairwise UTARs. The MUTARC is applied to generate adverse drug reaction (ADR) signals from real-world healthcare administrative databases. It reliably shortlists not only six known ADRs, but also another ADR, flucloxacillin possibly causing hepatitis, which our algorithm designers and experiment runners have not known before the experiments.

OBJECTIVE: The goal of MADE is to provide a set of common evaluation tasks to assess the state of the art for natural language processing (NLP) systems applied to EHRs supporting drug safety surveillance and pharmacovigilance. We also provide benchmarks on the MADE dataset using the system submissions received in the MADE 2018 challenge. METHODS: The MADE 1.0 challenge has released an expert-annotated cohort of medication and ADE information comprising 1089 fully de-identified longitudinal EHR notes from 21 randomly selected patients with cancer at the University of Massachusetts Memorial Hospital. Using this cohort as a benchmark, the MADE 1.0 challenge designed three shared NLP tasks. The named entity recognition (NER) task identifies medications and their attributes (dosage, route, duration, and frequency), indications, ADEs, and severity. The relation identification (RI) task identifies relations between the named entities: medication-indication, medication-ADE, and attribute relations. The third shared task (NER-RI) evaluates NLP models that perform the NER and RI tasks jointly. In total, 11 teams from four countries participated in at least one of the three shared tasks, and 41 system submissions were received in total. RESULTS: The best systems F(1) scores for NER, RI, and NER-RI were 0.82, 0.86, and 0.61, respectively. Ensemble classifiers using the team submissions improved the performance further, with an F(1) score of 0.85, 0.87, and 0.66 for the three tasks, respectively. CONCLUSION: MADE results show that recent progress in NLP has led to remarkable improvements in NER and RI tasks for the clinical domain. However, some room for improvement remains, particularly in the NER-RI task.",2019,Jan,Drug Saf,42,1,99-111,30649735,10.1007/s40264-018-0762-z,,#5238,Jagannatha 2019,Exclusion reason: Review Paper; ,""
Extraction of drug-drug interaction using neural embedding,"Hou, W. J.; Ceesay, B.","Information on changes in a drug's effect when taken in combination with a second drug, known as drug-drug interaction (DDI), is relevant in the pharmaceutical industry. DDIs can delay, decrease, or enhance absorption of either drug and thus decrease or increase their action or cause adverse effects. Information Extraction (IE) can be of great benefit in allowing identification and extraction of relevant information on DDIs. We here propose an approach for the extraction of DDI from text using neural word embedding to train a machine learning system. Results show that our system is competitive against other systems for the task of extracting DDIs, and that significant improvements can be achieved by learning from word features and using a deep-learning approach. Our study demonstrates that machine learning techniques such as neural networks and deep learning methods can efficiently aid in IE from text. Our proposed approach is well suited to play a significant role in future research.",2018,Dec,J Bioinform Comput Biol,16,6,1840027,30567477,10.1142/s0219720018400279,,#2990,Hou 2018,Exclusion reason: Lack of Pharmacovigilance/Drug Safety; ,""
Detecting possible vaccination reactions in clinical notes,"Hazlehurst, B.; Mullooly, J.; Naleway, A.; Crane, B.","The Vaccine Safety Datalink is a collaboration between the CDC and eight large HMO's to investigate adverse events following immunization through analysis of medical care databases and patients' medical charts. We modified an existing system called MediClass that uses natural language processing (NLP) and knowledge-based methods to classify clinical encounters recorded in electronic medical records (EMRs). We developed the knowledge necessary for MediClass to detect possible vaccine reactions in the outpatient, ED, and telephone encounters recorded in the EMR of a large HMO. We first trained the system using a manually coded gold standard training set, and achieved high sensitivity and specificity. We then ran a large set of post-immunization encounter records through MediClass to see if our method would generalize. Compared to methods that use administrative and clinical codes assigned to the EMR by clinicians, the system significantly improves the positive predictive value for detecting possible vaccine reactions.",2005,,AMIA Annu Symp Proc,2005,,306-310,16779051,,,#2091,Hazlehurst 2005,Exclusion reason: Lack of Machine Learning; ,""

OTC analgesic and antipyretic drugs are widely used in Japan. The present study aimed to survey the components of OTC drug package inserts for analgesic and antipyretic drugs and to evaluate the adverse event profiles using the Japanese Adverse Drug Event Report database (JADER). The JADER contains 430587 reports from between April 2004 and November 2016; a total of 750 reports of adverse events resulted from the use of OTC analgesic and antipyretic drugs.

Detection of drug risks after approval Methods development for the use of routine statutory health insurance data,"Foraita, R.; Dijkstra, L.; Falkenberg, F.; Garling, M.; Linder, R.; Pflock, R.; Rizkallah, M. R.; Schwaninger, M.; Wright, M. N.; Pigeot, I.","Adverse drug reactions are among the leading causes of death. Pharmacovigilance aims to monitor drugs after they have been released to the market in order to detect potential risks. Data sources commonly used to this end are spontaneous reports sent in by doctors or pharmaceutical companies. Reports alone are rather limited when it comes to detecting potential health risks. Routine statutory health insurance data, however, are a richer source since they not only provide a detailed picture of the patients' wellbeing over time, but also contain information on concomitant medication and comorbidities. To take advantage of their potential and to increase drug safety, we will further develop statistical methods that have shown their merit in other fields as a source of inspiration. A plethora of methods have been proposed over the years for spontaneous reporting data: a comprehensive comparison of these methods and their potential use for longitudinal data should be explored. In addition, we show how methods from machine learning could aid in identifying rare risks. We discuss these so-called enrichment analyses and how utilizing pharmaceutical similarities between drugs and similarities between comorbidities could help to construct risk profiles of the patients prone to experience an adverse drug event.

Using Twitter to Surveil the Opioid Epidemic in North Carolina: An Exploratory Study,"Anwar, M.; Khoury, D.; Aldridge, A. P.; Parker, S. J.; Conway, K. P.","BACKGROUND: Over the last two decades, deaths associated with opioids have escalated in number and geographic spread, impacting more and more individuals, families, and communities. Reflecting on the shifting nature of the opioid overdose crisis, Dasgupta, Beletsky, and Ciccarone offer a triphasic framework to explain that opioid overdose deaths (OODs) shifted from prescription opioids for pain (beginning in 2000), to heroin (2010 to 2015), and then to synthetic opioids (beginning in 2013). Given the rapidly shifting nature of OODs, timelier surveillance data are critical to inform strategies that combat the opioid crisis. Using easily accessible and near real-time social media data to improve public health surveillance efforts related to the opioid crisis is a promising area of research. OBJECTIVE: This study explored the potential of using Twitter data to monitor the opioid epidemic. Specifically, this study investigated the extent to which the content of opioid-related tweets corresponds with the triphasic nature of the opioid crisis and correlates with OODs in North Carolina between 2009 and 2017. METHODS: Opioid-related Twitter posts were obtained using Crimson Hexagon, and were classified as relating to prescription opioids, heroin, and synthetic opioids using natural language processing. This process resulted in a corpus of 100,777 posts consisting of tweets, retweets, mentions, and replies. Using a random sample of 10,000 posts from the corpus, we identified opioid-related terms by analyzing word frequency for each year. OODs were obtained from the Multiple Cause of Death database from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Wide-ranging Online Data for Epidemiologic Research (CDC WONDER). Least squares regression and Granger tests compared patterns of opioid-related posts with OODs. RESULTS: The pattern of tweets related to prescription opioids, heroin, and synthetic opioids resembled the triphasic nature of OODs. For prescription opioids, tweet counts and OODs were statistically unrelated. Tweets mentioning heroin and synthetic opioids were significantly associated with heroin OODs and synthetic OODs in the same year (P=.01 and P<.001, respectively), as well as in the following year (P=.03 and P=.01, respectively). Moreover, heroin tweets in a given year predicted heroin deaths better than lagged heroin OODs alone (P=.03).

Internet surveillance: content analysis and monitoring of product-specific internet prescription opioid abuse-related postings,"Butler, S. F.; Venuti, S. W.; Benoit, C.; Beaulaurier, R. L.; Houle, B.; Katz, N.","OBJECTIVES: This study describes the development of a systematic approach to the analysis of Internet chatter as a means of monitoring potentially abusable opioid analgesics. METHODS: Message boards dedicated to drug abuse were selected using specific inclusion criteria. Threaded discussions containing 48,293 posts were captured. A coding system was created to compare content of posts related to 3 opioid analgesics: Kadian, Vicodin, and OxyContin. RESULTS: The number of posts containing mentions of the target drugs were significantly different [OxyContin (1813)>Vicodin (940)>Kadian (27), P<0.001]. Analyses revealed that these differences were not simply a reflection of the availability of each product (ie, number of prescriptions written). Reliability tests indicated that the content coding system achieved good interrater reliability coefficients (average kappa across all categories=0.76, range=0.52 to 1.0). Content analysis of a sample of 234 randomly selected posts indicated that the proportion of Internet posts endorsing abuse of Kadian was statistically significantly less than OxyContin (45.5% vs. 68.4%, P=0.036, not adjusted for multiple comparisons). DISCUSSION: These results suggest that a systematic approach to postmarketing surveillance of Internet chatter related to pharmaceutical products is feasible and yields reliable information about the quantity of discussion of specific products and qualitative information regarding the nature of the discussions.

Leveraging social networks for toxicovigilance,"Chary, M.; Genes, N.; McKenzie, A.; Manini, A. F.","The landscape of drug abuse is shifting. Traditional means of characterizing these changes, such as national surveys or voluntary reporting by frontline clinicians, can miss changes in usage the emergence of novel drugs. Delays in detecting novel drug usage patterns make it difficult to evaluate public policy aimed at altering drug abuse. Increasingly, newer methods to inform frontline providers to recognize symptoms associated with novel drugs or methods of administration are needed. The growth of social networks may address this need. The objective of this manuscript is to introduce tools for using data from social networks to characterize drug abuse. We outline a structured approach to analyze social media in order to capture emerging trends in drug abuse by applying powerful methods from artificial intelligence, computational linguistics, graph theory, and agent-based modeling. First, we describe how to obtain data from social networks such as Twitter using publicly available automated programmatic interfaces. Then, we discuss how to use artificial intelligence techniques to extract content useful for purposes of toxicovigilance. This filtered content can be employed to generate real-time maps of drug usage across geographical regions. Beyond describing the real-time epidemiology of drug abuse, techniques from computational linguistics can uncover ways that drug discussions differ from other online conversations. Next, graph theory can elucidate the structure of networks discussing drug abuse, helping us learn what online interactions promote drug abuse and whether these interactions differ among drugs. Finally, agent-based modeling relates online interactions to psychological archetypes, providing a link between epidemiology and behavior. An analysis of social media discussions about drug abuse patterns with computational linguistics, graph theory, and agent-based modeling permits the real-time monitoring and characterization of trends of drugs of abuse. These tools provide a powerful complement to existing methods of toxicovigilance.",2013,Jun,J Med Toxicol,9,2,184-191,23619711,10.1007/s13181-013-0299-6,,#4179,Chary 2013,Exclusion reason: Lack of Pharmacovigilance/Drug Safety; ,Awaiting classification; opioid

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data from electronic health records were collated over a period of 18 months. Inferred scores at a patient level (probability of a patient's set of active orders to require a pharmacist review) were calculated using a hybrid approach (machine learning and a rule-based expert system). A clinical pharmacist analyzed randomly selected prescription orders over a 2-week period to corroborate our findings. Predicted scores were compared with the pharmacist's review using the area under the receiving-operating characteristic curve and area under the precision-recall curve. These metrics were compared with existing tools: computerized alerts generated by a clinical decision support (CDS) system and a literature-based multicriteria query prioritization technique. Data from 10 716 individual patients (133 179 prescription orders) were used to train the algorithm on the basis of 25 features in a development dataset. RESULTS: While the pharmacist analyzed 412 individual patients (3364 prescription orders) in an independent validation dataset, the areas under the receiving-operating characteristic and precision-recall curves of our digital system were 0.81 and 0.75, respectively, thus demonstrating greater accuracy than the CDS system (0.65 and 0.56, respectively) and multicriteria query techniques (0.68 and 0.56, respectively).

Development of Decision Forest Models for Prediction of Drug-Induced Liver Injury in Humans Using A Large Set of FDA-approved Drugs,"Hong, H.; Thakkar, S.; Chen, M.; Tong, W.","Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) presents a significant challenge to drug development and regulatory science. The FDA's Liver Toxicity Knowledge Base (LTKB) evaluated >1000 drugs for their likelihood of causing DILI in humans, of which >700 drugs were classified into three categories (most-DILI, less-DILI, and no-DILI). Based on this dataset, we developed and compared 2-class and 3-class DILI prediction models using the machine learning algorithm of Decision Forest (DF) with Mold2 structural descriptors. The models were evaluated through 1000 iterations of 5-fold cross-validations, 1000 bootstrapping validations and 1000 permutation tests (that assessed the chance correlation). Furthermore, prediction confidence analysis was conducted, which provides an additional parameter for proper interpretation of prediction results. We revealed that the 3-class model not only had a higher resolution to estimate DILI risk but also showed an improved capability to differentiate most-DILI drugs from no-DILI drugs in comparison with the 2-class DILI model. We demonstrated the utility of the models for drug ingredients with warnings very recently issued by the FDA. Moreover, we identified informative molecular features important for assessing DILI risk.

Machine Learning for Drug Overdose Surveillance,"Neill, D.

We apply this approach to 17 years of county-aggregated data for monthly opioid overdose deaths in the New York City metropolitan area, showing clear advantages in the utility of discovered patterns as compared to typical anomaly detection approaches. To detect and characterize emerging overdose patterns that differentially affect a subpopulation of the data, including geographic, demographic, and behavioral patterns (e.g., which combinations of drugs are involved), we apply the Multidimensional Tensor Scan (Neill, 2017) to 8 years of caselevel overdose data from Allegheny County, Pennsylvania.

Track 2 focused on extraction of adverse drug events (ADEs) from clinical records and evaluated 3 tasks: concept extraction, relation classification, and end-to-end systems. We perform an analysis of the results to identify the state of the art in these tasks, learn from it, and build on it. MATERIALS AND METHODS: For all tasks, teams were given raw text of narrative discharge summaries, and in all the tasks, participants proposed deep learning-based methods with hand-designed features. In the concept extraction task, participants used sequence labelling models (bidirectional long short-term memory being the most popular), whereas in the relation classification task, they also experimented with instance-based classifiers (namely support vector machines and rules). Ensemble methods were also popular. RESULTS: A total of 28 teams participated in task 1, with 21 teams in tasks 2 and 3. The best performing systems set a high performance bar with F1 scores of 0.9418 for concept extraction, 0.9630 for relation classification, and 0.8905 for end-to-end. However, the results were much lower for concepts and relations of Reasons and ADEs. These were often missed because local context is insufficient to identify them. CONCLUSIONS: This challenge shows that clinical concept extraction and relation classification systems have a high performance for many concept types, but significant improvement is still required for ADEs and Reasons. Incorporating the larger context or outside knowledge will likely improve the performance of future systems.",2020,Jan 1,J Am Med Inform Assoc,27,1,3-12,31584655,10.1093/jamia/ocz166,,#37,Henry 2020,Exclusion reason: Review Paper; ,Awaiting classification
Assessing the International Transferability of a Machine Learning Model for Detecting Medication Error in the General Internal Medicine Clinic: Multicenter Preliminary Validation Study,"Chin, Y. P.

W.","Background: Although most current medication error prevention systems are rule-based, these systems may result in alert fatigue because of poor accuracy. Previously, we had developed a machine learning (ML) model based on Taiwan's local databases (TLD) to address this issue. However, the international transferability of this model is unclear. Objective: This study examines the international transferability of a machine learning model for detecting medication errors and whether the federated learning approach could further improve the accuracy of the model. Methods: The study cohort included 667,572 outpatient prescriptions from 2 large US academic medical centers. Our ML model was applied to build the original model (O model), the local model (L model), and the hybrid model (H model). The O model was built using the data of 1.34 billion outpatient prescriptions from TLD. A validation set with 8.98% (60,000/667,572) of the prescriptions was first randomly sampled, and the remaining 91.02% (607,572/667,572) of the prescriptions served as the local training set for the L model. With a federated learning approach, the H model used the association values with a higher frequency of co-occurrence among the 0 and L models. A testing set with 600 prescriptions was classified as substantiated and unsubstantiated by 2 independent physician reviewers and was then used to assess model performance. Results: The interrater agreement was significant in terms of classifying prescriptions as substantiated and unsubstantiated (kappa=0.91; 95% CI 0.88 to 0.95). With thresholds ranging from 0.5 to 1.5, the alert accuracy ranged from 75%-78% for the O model, 76%-78% for the L model, and 79%-85% for the H model. Conclusions: Our ML model has good international transferability among US hospital data.

Exploring the differential experience of breast cancer treatment-related symptoms: a cluster analytic approach,"Gwede, C. K.; Small, B. J.; Munster, P. N.; Andrykowski, M. A.; Jacobsen, P. B.","INTRODUCTION: Cancer patients experience multiple concurrent symptoms. This exploratory analysis assessed symptom burden among patients undergoing chemotherapy for breast cancer to identify distinct subgroups of patients who experience differential symptom burden and assessed whether the patient subgroups were associated with deleterious quality of life (QOL) outcomes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Women (N = 133) with stage I and II breast cancer undergoing adjuvant chemotherapy after primary surgery were evaluated at baseline and at the end of chemotherapy using the Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale (MSAS) and the SF-36 QOL questionnaire. Post treatment MSAS symptoms were included in hierarchical cluster analysis. Two patient subgroups were identified that corresponded to a high-symptom prevalence group and a low-symptom group. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: No marked, statistically significant differences were found between groups on demographic, symptoms, QOL, or treatment variables at baseline. Patients in the high-symptom cluster were more likely to have stage I disease (p < 0.05). The two groups of patients showed significant differences in end-of-treatment symptoms and QOL scores (p < 0.05). The high-symptom burden group was more likely to report greater symptom prevalence and poorer QOL. CONCLUSIONS: Future research needs to examine why these differences occur despite similarities in treatment and how symptom burden can be reduced for the high-symptom prevalence group.",2008,Aug,Support Care Cancer,16,8,925-933,18043948,10.1007/s00520-007-0364-2,,#2951,Gwede 2008,Exclusion reason: Lack of Pharmacovigilance/Drug Safety; ,Awaiting classification
Assessing Antidepressants Using Intelligent Data Monitoring and Mining of Online Fora,"Akay, A.; Dragomir, A.; Erlandsson, B. E.","Depression is a global health concern. Social networks allow the affected population to share their experiences. These experiences, when mined, extracted, and analyzed, can be converted into either warnings to recall drugs (dangerous side effects), or service improvement (interventions, treatment options) based on observations derived from user behavior in depression-related social networks. Our aim was to develop a weighted network model to represent user activity on social health networks. This enabled us to accurately represent user interactions by relying on the data's semantic content. Our three-step method uses the weighted network model to represent user's activity, and network clustering and module analysis to characterize user interactions and extract further knowledge from user's posts. The network's topological properties reflect user activity such as posts' general topic as well as timing, while weighted edges reflect the posts semantic content and similarities among posts. The result, a synthesis from word data frequency, statistical analysis of module content, and the modeled health network's properties, has allowed us to gain insight into consumer sentiment of antidepressants.

Comparing a knowledge-driven approach to a supervised machine learning approach in large-scale extraction of drug-side effect relationships from free-text biomedical literature,"Xu, R.; Wang, Q.","BACKGROUND: Systems approaches to studying drug-side-effect (drug-SE) associations are emerging as an active research area for both drug target discovery and drug repositioning. However, a comprehensive drug-SE association knowledge base does not exist. In this study, we present a novel knowledge-driven (KD) approach to effectively extract a large number of drug-SE pairs from published biomedical literature. DATA AND METHODS: For the text corpus, we used 21,354,075 MEDLINE records (119,085,682 sentences). First, we used known drug-SE associations derived from FDA drug labels as prior knowledge to automatically find SE-related sentences and abstracts. We then extracted a total of 49,575 drug-SE pairs from MEDLINE sentences and 180,454 pairs from abstracts. RESULTS: On average, the KD approach has achieved a precision of 0.335, a recall of 0.509, and an F1 of 0.392, which is significantly better than a SVM-based machine learning approach (precision: 0.135, recall: 0.900, F1: 0.233) with a 73.0% increase in F1 score. Through integrative analysis, we demonstrate that the higher-level phenotypic drug-SE relationships reflects lower-level genetic, genomic, and chemical drug mechanisms. In addition, we show that the extracted drug-SE pairs can be directly used in drug repositioning. CONCLUSION: In summary, we automatically constructed a large-scale higher-level drug phenotype relationship knowledge, which can have great potential in computational drug discovery.",2015,,BMC Bioinformatics,16 Suppl 5,Suppl 5,S6,25860223,10.1186/1471-2105-16-s5-s6,,#1289,Xu 2015,Exclusion reason: Lack of Pharmacovigilance/Drug Safety; ,Awaiting classification

Adverse Drug Reaction Discovery Using a Tumor-Biomarker Knowledge Graph,"Wang, M.; Ma, X.; Si, J.; Tang, H.; Wang, H.; Li, T.; Ouyang, W.; Gong, L.; Tang, Y.; He, X.; Huang, W.; Liu, X.","Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are a major public health concern, and early detection is crucial for drug development and patient safety. Together with the increasing availability of large-scale literature data, machine learning has the potential to predict unknown ADRs from current knowledge. By the machine learning methods, we constructed a Tumor-Biomarker Knowledge Graph (TBKG) which contains four types of node: Tumor, Biomarker, Drug, and ADR using biomedical literatures. Based on this knowledge graph, we not only discovered potential ADRs of antitumor drugs but also provided explanations. Experiments on real-world data show that our model can achieve 0.81 accuracy of three cross-validation and the ADRs discovery of Osimertinib was chosen for the clinical validation. Calculated ADRs of Osimertinib by our model consisted of the known ADRs which were in line with the official manual and some unreported rare ADRs in clinical cases. Results also showed that our model outperformed traditional co-occurrence methods. Moreover, each calculated ADRs were attached with the corresponding paths of ""tumor-biomarker-drug"" in the knowledge graph which could help to obtain in-depth insights into the underlying mechanisms. In conclusion, the tumor-biomarker knowledge-graph based approach is an explainable method for potential ADRs discovery based on biomarkers and might be valuable to the community working on the emerging field of biomedical literature mining and provide impetus for the mechanism research of ADRs.",2020,,Front Genet,11,,625659,33584816,10.3389/fgene.2020.625659,,#192,Wang 2020,Exclusion reason: Lack of Pharmacovigilance/Drug Safety; ,Awaiting classification
Investigating ADR mechanisms with Explainable AI: a feasibility study with knowledge graph mining,"Bresso, E.; Monnin, P.; Bousquet, C.; Calvier, F. E.; Ndiaye, N. C.; Petitpain, N.; Smaïl-Tabbone, M.; Coulet, A.","BACKGROUND: Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are statistically characterized within randomized clinical trials and postmarketing pharmacovigilance, but their molecular mechanism remains unknown in most cases. This is true even for hepatic or skin toxicities, which are classically monitored during drug design. Aside from clinical trials, many elements of knowledge about drug ingredients are available in open-access knowledge graphs, such as their properties, interactions, or involvements in pathways. In addition, drug classifications that label drugs as either causative or not for several ADRs, have been established. METHODS: We propose in this paper to mine knowledge graphs for identifying biomolecular features that may enable automatically reproducing expert classifications that distinguish drugs causative or not for a given type of ADR. In an Explainable AI perspective, we explore simple classification techniques such as Decision Trees and Classification Rules because they provide human-readable models, which explain the classification itself, but may also provide elements of explanation for molecular mechanisms behind ADRs. In summary, (1) we mine a knowledge graph for features; (2) we train classifiers at distinguishing, on the basis of extracted features, drugs associated or not with two commonly monitored ADRs: drug-induced liver injuries (DILI) and severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCAR); (3) we isolate features that are both efficient in reproducing expert classifications and interpretable by experts (i.e., Gene Ontology terms, drug targets, or pathway names); and (4) we manually evaluate in a mini-study how they may be explanatory. RESULTS: Extracted features reproduce with a good fidelity classifications of drugs causative or not for DILI and SCAR (Accuracy = 0.74 and 0.81, respectively). Experts fully agreed that 73% and 38% of the most discriminative features are possibly explanatory for DILI and SCAR, respectively; and partially agreed (2/3) for 90% and 77% of them. CONCLUSION: Knowledge graphs provide sufficiently diverse features to enable simple and explainable models to distinguish between drugs that are causative or not for ADRs.

"Machine learning-based prediction of drug-drug interactions by integrating drug phenotypic, therapeutic, chemical, and genomic properties","Cheng, F.; Zhao, Z.","OBJECTIVE: Drug-drug interactions (DDIs) are an important consideration in both drug development and clinical application, especially for co-administered medications. While it is necessary to identify all possible DDIs during clinical trials, DDIs are frequently reported after the drugs are approved for clinical use, and they are a common cause of adverse drug reactions (ADR) and increasing healthcare costs. Computational prediction may assist in identifying potential DDIs during clinical trials. METHODS: Here we propose a heterogeneous network-assisted inference (HNAI) framework to assist with the prediction of DDIs. First, we constructed a comprehensive DDI network that contained 6946 unique DDI pairs connecting 721 approved drugs based on DrugBank data. Next, we calculated drug-drug pair similarities using four features: phenotypic similarity based on a comprehensive drug-ADR network, therapeutic similarity based on the drug Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical classification system, chemical structural similarity from SMILES data, and genomic similarity based on a large drug-target interaction network built using the DrugBank and Therapeutic Target Database. Finally, we applied five predictive models in the HNAI framework: naive Bayes, decision tree, k-nearest neighbor, logistic regression, and support vector machine, respectively. RESULTS: The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of the HNAI models is 0.67 as evaluated using fivefold cross-validation. Using antipsychotic drugs as an example, several HNAI-predicted DDIs that involve weight gain and cytochrome P450 inhibition were supported by literature resources.

L.; Ball, R.; Botsis, T.","INTRODUCTION: The US FDA receives more than 2 million postmarket reports each year. Safety Evaluators (SEs) review these reports, as well as external information, to identify potential safety signals. With the increasing number of reports and the size of external information, more efficient solutions for data integration and decision making are needed. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to develop an interactive decision support application for drug safety surveillance that integrates and visualizes information from postmarket reports, product labels, and biomedical literature. METHODS: We conducted multiple meetings with a group of seven SEs at the FDA to collect the requirements for the Information Visualization Platform (InfoViP). Using infographic design principles, we implemented the InfoViP prototype version as a modern web application using the integrated information collected from the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System, the DailyMed repository, and PubMed. The same group of SEs evaluated the InfoViP prototype functionalities using a simple evaluation form and provided input for potential enhancements. RESULTS: The SEs described their workflows and overall expectations around the automation of time-consuming tasks, including the access to the visualization of external information. We developed a set of wireframes, shared them with the SEs, and finalized the InfoViP design. The InfoViP prototype architecture relied on a javascript and a python-based framework, as well as an existing tool for the processing of free-text information in all sources. This natural language processing tool supported multiple functionalities, especially the construction of time plots for individual postmarket reports and groups of reports. Overall, we received positive comments from the SEs during the InfoViP prototype evaluation and addressed their suggestions in the final version.

Designing and evaluating an automated system for real-time medication administration error detection in a neonatal intensive care unit,"Ni, Y. Z.; Lingren, T.; Hall, E. S.; Leonard, M.; Melton, K.; Kirkendall, E. S.","Background: Timely identification of medication administration errors (MAEs) promises great benefits for mitigating medication errors and associated harm. Despite previous efforts utilizing computerized methods to monitor medication errors, sustaining effective and accurate detection of MAEs remains challenging. In this study, we developed a real-time MAE detection system and evaluated its performance prior to system integration into institutional workflows. Methods: Our prospective observational study included automated MAE detection of 10 high-risk medications and fluids for patients admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center during a 4-month period. The automated system extracted real-time medication use information from the institutional electronic health records and identified MAEs using logic-based rules and natural language processing techniques. The MAE summary was delivered via a real-time messaging platform to promote reduction of patient exposure to potential harm. System performance was validated using a physician-generated gold standard of MAE events, and results were compared with those of current practice (incident reporting and trigger tools). Results: Physicians identified 116 MAEs from 10 104 medication administrations during the study period. Compared to current practice, the sensitivity with automated MAE detection was improved significantly from 4.3% to 85.3% (P=.009), with a positive predictive value of 78.0%. Furthermore, the system showed potential to reduce patient exposure to harm, from 256 min to 35 min (P<.001).

The effects of adverse drug reactions on patients' satisfaction: Evidence from publicly available data on Tamiflu (oseltamivir),"Antipov, E. A.; Pokryshevskaya, E. B.","BACKGROUND: Despite the fact that user-generated data are widely used in medical informatics in general and for revealing side-effects of various pharmaceuticals in particular, recent studies have focused merely on methods of extracting information on side effects from unstructured or semi-structured reviews of specific medications without linking side effects to any outcomes. OBJECTIVES: In this study we demonstrate how user-generated online content on side effects experienced by patients while taking a pharmaceutical product can be used to do research after the drug has been introduced to the market, thus allowing to complement the results of official clinical studies and market research. In particular, we concentrate on revealing the contribution of various side effects to reported customer satisfaction with Tamiflu, a popular antiviral drug. METHODS: Publicly available data from an online platform with reviews from patients are used as an input to the analysis that applies statistical and machine learning methods (multivariate logit models and classification trees) to investigate the relationships of side effects to demographic characteristics and to the overall satisfaction with the medication. RESULTS: We prioritized side effects of Tamiflu based on the significance of their association with patient's ratings published at one of the well-known drug discussion forums. Among all types of side effects used in our study, the neuropsychiatric symptoms and body pain are the most influential, followed by skin problems.

Predicting Polypharmacy Side-effects Using Knowledge Graph Embeddings,"Nováček, V.; Mohamed, S. K.","Polypharmacy is the use of drug combinations and is commonly used for treating complex and terminal diseases. Despite its effectiveness in many cases, it poses high risks of adverse side effects. Polypharmacy side-effects occur due to unwanted interactions of combined drugs, and they can cause severe complications to patients which results in increasing the risks of morbidity and leading to new mortalities. The use of drug polypharmacy is currently in its early stages; thus, the knowledge of their probable side-effects is limited. This encouraged multiple works to investigate machine learning techniques to efficiently and reliably predict adverse effects of drug combinations. In this context, the Decagon model is known to provide state-of-the-art results. It models polypharmacy side-effect data as a knowledge graph and formulates finding possible adverse effects as a link prediction task over the knowledge graph. The link prediction is solved using an embedding model based on graph convolutions. Despite its effectiveness, the Decagon approach still suffers from a high rate of false positives. In this work, we propose a new knowledge graph embedding technique that uses multi-part embedding vectors to predict polypharmacy side-effects. Like in the Decagon model, we model polypharmacy side effects as a knowledge graph. However, we perform the link prediction task using an approach based on tensor decomposition. Our experimental evaluation shows that our approach outperforms the Decagon model with 12% and 16% margins in terms of the area under the ROC and precision recall curves, respectively.",2020,,AMIA Jt Summits Transl Sci Proc,2020,,449-458,32477666,,,#5715,Nováček 2020,Exclusion reason: Lack of Pharmacovigilance/Drug Safety; ,Awaiting classification

The outputs from the two networks (GCNN and BiLSTM) are then concatenated and a fully connected network is used to predict the side effects of drugs. Our model achieves an AUC score of 0.846 irrespective of what classification threshold is chosen. It has a precision score of 0.925 and the Bilingual Evaluation Understudy (BLEU) scores obtained were 0.973, 0.938, 0.927, and 0.318 which show significant achievements despite the fact that a small drug data set is used for adverse drug reaction (ADR) prediction. Moreover, the model is capable of accurately structuring correct words to describe drug side-effects and associates them with its drug name and molecular structure.

Determining molecular predictors of adverse drug reactions with causality analysis based on structure learning,"Liu, M.; Cai, R.; Hu, Y.; Matheny, M. E.; Sun, J.; Hu, J.; Xu, H.","OBJECTIVE: Adverse drug reaction (ADR) can have dire consequences. However, our current understanding of the causes of drug-induced toxicity is still limited. Hence it is of paramount importance to determine molecular factors of adverse drug responses so that safer therapies can be designed. METHODS: We propose a causality analysis model based on structure learning (CASTLE) for identifying factors that contribute significantly to ADRs from an integration of chemical and biological properties of drugs. This study aims to address two major limitations of the existing ADR prediction studies. First, ADR prediction is mostly performed by assessing the correlations between the input features and ADRs, and the identified associations may not indicate causal relations. Second, most predictive models lack biological interpretability. RESULTS: CASTLE was evaluated in terms of prediction accuracy on 12 organ-specific ADRs using 830 approved drugs. The prediction was carried out by first extracting causal features with structure learning and then applying them to a support vector machine (SVM) for classification. Through rigorous experimental analyses, we observed significant increases in both macro and micro F1 scores compared with the traditional SVM classifier, from 0.88 to 0.89 and 0.74 to 0.81, respectively. Most importantly, identified links between the biological factors and organ-specific drug toxicities were partially supported by evidence in Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man.

The increasing availability of electronic health records (EHR) offers new opportunities to generate population-level patient-centered evidence on oncologic care that can better guide treatment decisions and patient-valued care. METHODS: This study includes patients seeking care at an academic medical center, 2008 to 2018. Digital data sources are combined to address missingness, inaccuracy, and noise common to EHR data. Clinical concepts were identified and extracted from EHR unstructured data using natural language processing (NLP) and machine/deep learning techniques. All models are trained, tested, and validated on independent data samples using standard metrics. RESULTS: We provide use cases for using EHR data to assess guideline adherence and quality measurements among patients with cancer. Pretreatment assessment was evaluated by guideline adherence and quality metrics for cancer staging metrics. Our studies in perioperative quality focused on medications administered and guideline adherence. Patient outcomes included treatment-related side effects and patient-reported outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Advanced technologies applied to EHRs present opportunities to advance population-level quality assessment, to learn from routinely collected clinical data for personalized treatment guidelines, and to augment epidemiologic and population health studies. The effective use of digital data can inform patient-valued care, quality initiatives, and policy guidelines.

Mining e-cigarette adverse events in social media using Bi-LSTM recurrent neural network with word embedding representation,"Xie, J.; Liu, X.; Zeng, D. D.","Objective: Recent years have seen increased worldwide popularity of e-cigarette use. However, the risks of e-cigarettes are underexamined. Most e-cigarette adverse event studies have achieved low detection rates due to limited subject sample sizes in the experiments and surveys. Social media provides a large data repository of consumers' e-cigarette feedback and experiences, which are useful for e-cigarette safety surveillance. However, it is difficult to automatically interpret the informal and nontechnical consumer vocabulary about e-cigarettes in social media. This issue hinders the use of social media content for e-cigarette safety surveillance. Recent developments in deep neural network methods have shown promise for named entity extraction from noisy text. Motivated by these observations, we aimed to design a deep neural network approach to extract e-cigarette safety information in social media. Methods: Our deep neural language model utilizes word embedding as the representation of text input and recognizes named entity types with the state-of-the-art Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) Recurrent Neural Network. Results: Our Bi-LSTM model achieved the best performance compared to 3 baseline models, with a precision of 94.10%, a recall of 91.80%, and an F-measure of 92.94%. We identified 1591 unique adverse events and 9930 unique e-cigarette components (ie, chemicals, flavors, and devices) from our research testbed.

Understanding side effects of antidepressants: Large-scale longitudinal study on social media data,"Saha, K.; Torous, J.; Kiciman, E.; De Choudhury, M.","Background: Antidepressants are known to show heterogeneous effects across individuals and conditions, posing challenges to understanding their efficacy in mental health treatment. Social media platforms enable individuals to share their day-to-day concerns with others and thereby can function as unobtrusive, large-scale, and naturalistic data sources to study the longitudinal behavior of individuals taking antidepressants. Objective: We aim to understand the side effects of antidepressants from naturalistic expressions of individuals on social media. Methods: On a large-scale Twitter data set of individuals who self-reported using antidepressants, a quasi-experimental study using unsupervised language analysis was conducted to extract keywords that distinguish individuals who improved and who did not improve following the use of antidepressants. The net data set consists of over 8 million Twitter posts made by over 300,000 users in a 4-year period between January 1, 2014, and February 15, 2018. Results: Five major side effects of antidepressants were studied: Sleep, weight, eating, pain, and sexual issues. Social media language revealed keywords related to these side effects. In particular, antidepressants were found to show a spectrum of effects from decrease to increase in each of these side effects. Conclusions: This work enhances the understanding of the side effects of antidepressants by identifying distinct linguistic markers in the longitudinal social media data of individuals showing the most and least improvement following the self-reported intake of antidepressants. One implication of this work concerns the potential of social media data as an effective means to support digital pharmacovigilance and digital therapeutics. These results can inform clinicians in tailoring their discussion and assessment of side effects and inform patients about what to potentially expect and what may or may not be within the realm of normal aftereffects of antidepressants.",2021,,JMIR Mental Health,8,3,,,10.2196/26589,,#7439,Saha 2021,Exclusion reason: Lack of Pharmacovigilance/Drug Safety; ,Awaiting classification
Comparison of adverse event and device problem rates for transcatheter aortic valve replacement and Mitraclip procedures as reported by the Transcatheter Valve Therapy Registry and the Food and Drug Administration postmarket surveillance data,"Galper, B. Z.; Beery, D. E.; Leighton, G.; Englander, L. L.","BACKGROUND: Although outcomes data on transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) and transcatheter mitral valve repair (Mitraclip) are available via the Transcatheter Valve Therapy (TVT) registry, dissemination of TVT data is often delayed. The Food and Drug Administration's Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) system collects postmarket outcomes data in public medical device reports. We used natural language processing to compare the event rates for TAVR and Mitraclip in the TVT registry and from MAUDE data. METHODS: We identified all medical device reports related to TAVR and Mitraclip from December 2011 through December 2014. Our primary objective was to demonstrate that event rates in TVT and MAUDE were not significantly different. We also compared TVT event rates for TAVRs performed in 2014 to MAUDE-derived event rates for the Sapien XT and CoreValve devices, both Food and Drug Administration-approved in 2014. RESULTS: Regression analysis demonstrated close correlation between TVT and MAUDE rates for both TAVR and Mitraclip, with R(2) values of 0.86 and 0.77, respectively. The rates for all events except bleeding were not statistically significantly different. We demonstrated similar increased rates of permanent pacemaker implantation in the 2014 TVT and MAUDE data sets consistent with approval of the CoreValve. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated that natural language processing technology sorted through raw MAUDE data, allowing identification of the most common events associated with TAVR and Mitraclip procedures, and that MAUDE-derived event rates were not statistically significantly different from TVT event rates. This technology has important public health implications because it improves postmarket surveillance of implantable devices and permits rapid and early dissemination of vital information.",2018,Apr,Am Heart J,198,,64-74,29653650,10.1016/j.ahj.2017.10.013,,#1306,Galper 2018,Exclusion reason: Lack of Pharmacovigilance/Drug Safety; ,Awaiting classification
AI-based QSAR modeling for prediction of active compounds in MIE/AOP,"Uesawa, Y.","Toxicity testing is critical for new drug and chemical development process. A clinical study, experimental animal models, and in vitro study are performed to evaluate the safety of a new drug. The limitations of these methods include extensive time for toxicity testing, an ethical problem, and high costs of experimentation. Therefore computational methods are considered useful for estimating chemical toxicity. In silico toxicity prediction is one of the toxicity assessments that uses computational methods to predict and stimulate the toxicity of chemicals. In silico study aims to contribute to ešective development of new drug and chemical design. In this study, quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models will be used to predict toxicities based on chemical structural parameters. Because toxicities are complicated physiological phenomena, a similar toxicity expression might cause a dišerent pathway. Also, since many drugs with unknown mechanisms of actions are available, the application of artificial intelligence (AI)-which uses sophisticated algorithms? is increasingly used to predict toxicities. Recently, the QSAR model was applied to determine complex relations between chemical structures and toxicities. However, accuracy of QSAR for toxicity prediction remains an important issue. International competitions funded by public institutions can address this issue. Two important toxicity challenges were organized in the past decade; this article presents issues of toxicity based on these challenges.",2020,,Yakugaku Zasshi,140,4,499-505,,10.1248/yakushi.19-00190-4,,#242,Uesawa 2020,Exclusion reason: Lack of Pharmacovigilance/Drug Safety; ,""

Artificial Intelligence for Rapid Meta-Analysis: Case Study on Ocular Toxicity of Hydroxychloroquine,"Michelson, M.; Chow, T.; Martin, N. A.; Ross, M.; Tee Qiao Ying, A.; Minton, S.","BACKGROUND: Rapid access to evidence is crucial in times of an evolving clinical crisis. To that end, we propose a novel approach to answer clinical queries, termed rapid meta-analysis (RMA). Unlike traditional meta-analysis, RMA balances a quick time to production with reasonable data quality assurances, leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) to strike this balance. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to evaluate whether RMA can generate meaningful clinical insights, but crucially, in a much faster processing time than traditional meta-analysis, using a relevant, real-world example. METHODS: The development of our RMA approach was motivated by a currently relevant clinical question: is ocular toxicity and vision compromise a side effect of hydroxychloroquine therapy? At the time of designing this study, hydroxychloroquine was a leading candidate in the treatment of coronavirus disease (COVID-19). We then leveraged AI to pull and screen articles, automatically extract their results, review the studies, and analyze the data with standard statistical methods. RESULTS: By combining AI with human analysis in our RMA, we generated a meaningful, clinical result in less than 30 minutes. The RMA identified 11 studies considering ocular toxicity as a side effect of hydroxychloroquine and estimated the incidence to be 3.4% (95% CI 1.11%-9.96%). The heterogeneity across individual study findings was high, which should be taken into account in interpretation of the result. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate that a novel approach to meta-analysis using AI can generate meaningful clinical insights in a much shorter time period than traditional meta-analysis.",2020,Aug 17,J Med Internet Res,22,8,e20007,32804086,10.2196/20007,,#514,Michelson 2020,Exclusion reason: Lack of Pharmacovigilance/Drug Safety; ,""

In this review, we discuss the in vitro human liver systems and their applications in omics-based drug-induced hepatotoxicity studies. We furthermore present bioinformatic approaches that are useful for analyzing toxicogenomic data generated from these models and discuss their current and potential contributions to the understanding of mechanisms of DILI. Human pluripotent stem cells, carrying donor-specific genetic information, hold great potential for advancing the study of individual-specific toxicological responses. When co-cultured with other liver-derived non-parenchymal cells in a microfluidic device, the resulting dynamic platform enables us to study immune-mediated drug hypersensitivity and accelerates personalized drug toxicology studies. A flexible microfluidic platform would also support the assembly of a more advanced organs-on-a-chip device, further bridging gap between in vitro and in vivo conditions. The standard transcriptomic analysis of these cell systems can be complemented with causality-inferring approaches to improve the understanding of DILI mechanisms. These approaches involve statistical techniques capable of elucidating regulatory interactions in parts of these mechanisms. The use of more elaborated human liver models, in harmony with causality-inferring bioinformatic approaches will pave the way for establishing a powerful methodology to systematically assess DILI mechanisms across a wide range of conditions.",2019,,Archives of Toxicology,93,11,3067-3098,,10.1007/s00204-019-02585-5,,#456,Jiang 2019,Exclusion reason: Gene Expression Study; ,""

Extraction of pharmacokinetic evidence of drug-drug interactions from the literature,"Kolchinsky, A.; Lourenço, A.; Wu, H. Y.; Li, L.; Rocha, L. M.","Drug-drug interaction (DDI) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality and a subject of intense scientific interest. Biomedical literature mining can aid DDI research by extracting evidence for large numbers of potential interactions from published literature and clinical databases. Though DDI is investigated in domains ranging in scale from intracellular biochemistry to human populations, literature mining has not been used to extract specific types of experimental evidence, which are reported differently for distinct experimental goals. We focus on pharmacokinetic evidence for DDI, essential for identifying causal mechanisms of putative interactions and as input for further pharmacological and pharmacoepidemiology investigations. We used manually curated corpora of PubMed abstracts and annotated sentences to evaluate the efficacy of literature mining on two tasks: first, identifying PubMed abstracts containing pharmacokinetic evidence of DDIs; second, extracting sentences containing such evidence from abstracts. We implemented a text mining pipeline and evaluated it using several linear classifiers and a variety of feature transforms. The most important textual features in the abstract and sentence classification tasks were analyzed. We also investigated the performance benefits of using features derived from PubMed metadata fields, various publicly available named entity recognizers, and pharmacokinetic dictionaries. Several classifiers performed very well in distinguishing relevant and irrelevant abstracts (reaching F1≈0.93, MCC≈0.74, iAUC≈0.99) and sentences (F1≈0.76, MCC≈0.65, iAUC≈0.83). We found that word bigram features were important for achieving optimal classifier performance and that features derived from Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms significantly improved abstract classification. We also found that some drug-related named entity recognition tools and dictionaries led to slight but significant improvements, especially in classification of evidence sentences. Based on our thorough analysis of classifiers and feature transforms and the high classification performance achieved, we demonstrate that literature mining can aid DDI discovery by supporting automatic extraction of specific types of experimental evidence.",2015,,PLoS One,10,5,e0122199,25961290,10.1371/journal.pone.0122199,,#2993,Kolchinsky 2015,Exclusion reason: Lack of Pharmacovigilance/Drug Safety; ,""
Amikacin Concentrations Predictive of Ototoxicity in Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis Patients,"Modongo, C.; Pasipanodya, J. G.; Zetola, N. M.; Williams, S. M.; Sirugo, G.; Gumbo, T.","Aminoglycosides, such as amikacin, are used to treat multidrug-resistant tuberculosis. However, ototoxicity is a common problem and is monitored using peak and trough amikacin concentrations based on World Health Organization recommendations. Our objective was to identify clinical factors predictive of ototoxicity using an agnostic machine learning method. We used classification and regression tree (CART) analyses to identify clinical factors, including amikacin concentration thresholds that predicted audiometry-confirmed ototoxicity among 28 multidrug-resistant pulmonary tuberculosis patients in Botswana. Amikacin concentrations were measured for all patients. The quantitative relationship between predictive factors and the probability of ototoxicity were then identified using probit analyses. The primary predictors of ototoxicity on CART analyses were cumulative days of therapy, followed by cumulative area under the concentration-time curve (AUC), which improved on the primary predictor by 87%. The area under the receiver operating curve was 0.97 on the test set. Peak and trough were not predictors in any tree. When algorithms were forced to pick peak and trough as primary predictors, the area under the receiver operating curve fell to 0.46. Probit analysis revealed that the probability of ototoxicity increased sharply starting after 6 months of therapy to near maximum at 9 months. A 10% probability of ototoxicity occurred with a threshold cumulative AUC of 87,232 days · mg · h/liter, while that of 20% occurred at 120,000 days · mg · h/liter.

OBJECTIVE: This article evaluates whether an automated system, the Adverse Drug Effect Recognizer (ADER), could assist clinicians in detecting and addressing inpatients' ongoing preadmission ADRs. METHODS: ADER uses natural language processing to extract patients' medications, findings, and past diagnoses from admission notes. It compares excerpted information to a database of known medication adverse effects and promptly warns clinicians about potential ongoing ADRs and potential confounders via alerts placed in patients' electronic health records (EHRs). A 3-month intervention trial evaluated ADER's impact on antihypertensive medication ordering behaviors. At the time of patient admission, ADER warned providers on the Internal Medicine wards of Vanderbilt University Hospital about potential ongoing preadmission antihypertensive medication ADRs. A retrospective control group, comprised similar physicians from a period prior to the intervention, received no alerts. The evaluation compared ordering behaviors for each group to determine if preadmission medications changed during hospitalization or at discharge. The study also analyzed intervention group participants' survey responses and user comments. RESULTS: ADER identified potential preadmission ADRs for 30% of both groups. Compared with controls, intervention providers more often withheld or discontinued suspected ADR-causing medications during the inpatient stay (p < 0.001). Intervention providers who responded to alert-related surveys held or discontinued suspected ADR-causing medications more often at discharge (p < 0.001).

Methods: The NLP algorithm was developed using an internal NLP tool and training dataset of 311 potential anaphylaxis cases from Kaiser Permanente Southern California (KPSC). We applied the algorithm to the notes of another 731 potential cases (423 from KPSC; 308 from other sites) with relevant codes (ICD-9-CM diagnosis codes for anaphylaxis, vaccine adverse reactions, and allergic reactions; Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System codes for epinephrine administration). NLP results were compared against a reference standard of chart reviewed and adjudicated cases. The algorithm was then separately applied to the notes of 6 427 359 KPSC vaccination visits (9 402 194 vaccine doses) without relevant codes. Results: At KPSC, NLP identified 12 of 16 true vaccine-related cases and achieved a sensitivity of 75.0%, specificity of 98.5%, positive predictive value (PPV) of 66.7%, and negative predictive value of 99.0% when applied to notes of patients with relevant diagnosis codes. NLP did not identify the five true cases at other sites. When NLP was applied to the notes of KPSC patients without relevant codes, it captured eight additional true cases confirmed by chart review and adjudication. Conclusions: The current study demonstrated the potential to apply rule-based NLP algorithms to clinical notes to identify anaphylaxis cases. Increasing the size of training data, including clinical notes from all participating study sites in the training data, and preprocessing the clinical notes to handle special characters could improve the performance of the NLP algorithms.

Time-to-signal comparison for drug safety data-mining algorithms vs. traditional signaling criteria,"Hochberg, A.

Data-mining methods produced 101-324 signals vs. 1,051 for the N≥3 rule but yielded a higher proportion of signals having publication support. For the 2% rule, the fraction of signals having publication support was similar to that associated with data mining. Data-mining signals lagged N≥3 signaling by 1.5-11.0 months.

OBJECTIVE: To develop and validate a novel informatics method based on natural language processing (NLP) in combination with International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) codes that identifies allergic drug reactions in the electronic health record. METHODS: Previously studied and high-yield ICD-9-CM codes were used to screen for possible allergic drug reactions among all inpatients admitted in 2007 and 2008. A random sample was selected for manual chart review to identify true cases of allergic drug reactions. A rule-based NLP algorithm was then developed to identify allergic drug reactions using free-text clinical notes and discharge summaries from the filtered cases. The performance of using manual chart review of ICD-9-CM codes alone was compared with ICD-9-CM codes in combination with NLP. RESULTS: Of 3907 cases identified by ICD-9-CM codes, 725 (19%) were randomly selected for manual chart review; 335 were confirmed as allergic drug reactions, resulting in a positive predictive value (PPV) of 46% (range: 18%-79%) when using ICD-9-CM codes alone. Our NLP algorithm in combination with ICD-9-CM codes achieved a PPV of 86% (range: 69%-100%).

Prediction of Adverse Drug Reactions by Combining Biomedical Tripartite Network and Graph Representation Model,"Xue, R.; Liao, J.; Shao, X.; Han, K.; Long, J.; Shao, L.; Ai, N.; Fan, X.","As one of the primary contributors to high clinical attrition rates of drugs, toxicity evaluation is of critical significance to new drug discovery. Unsurprisingly, a vast number of computational methods have been developed at various stages of development pipeline to evaluate potential adverse drug reactions (ADRs). Despite previous success of these methods on individual ADR or certain drug family, there are great challenges to toxicity evaluation. In this study, a novel strategy was developed to predict the drug-ADR associations by combining deep learning and the biomedical tripartite network. This heterogeneous network contains biomedical linked data of three entities, for example, drugs, targets, and ADRs. For the first time, GraRep, a deep learning method for distributed representations, is introduced to learn graph representations and identify hidden features from the tripartite network which are further used for ADR prediction. Through this approach, drug-ADR associations could possibly be discovered from a systemic perspective. The accuracy of our method is 0.95 based on internal resource validation and 0.88 based on external resource validation. Moreover, our results show the prediction accuracy using the tripartite network is better than the one with bipartite network, suggesting the model performance can be improved with further enrichment on information. According to the result of 10-fold cross validation, the deep learning model outperforms two traditional methods (topology-based measures and chemical structure-based measures). Additionally, predictive models are also constructed using other deep learning methods, and comparable results are achieved.

Developing a signal triage algorithm for Thai national adverse drug reaction database,"Jamekornkul, C.; Chaisumritchoke, S. T.","There has been increasing adverse drug reaction (ADR) reports submitted to the Health Product Vigilance Center under the Thai Food and Drug Administration. To find some signals, the Thai Signal Detection Program was developed to identify and filter the potential signals, called signals of disproportionate reporting (SDRs). A large number of SDRs cannot be in-depth assessed by the Signal Detection Advisory Working Group (SDAWG) in time. The prioritized SDRs with concentrated in-depth assessment might help in finding some true signals. This preliminary study aimed at developing a signal triage algorithm that can prioritize SDRs to assign an in-depth assessment for true signals and to test the proposed triage algorithm and compare against the traditional method by the SDAWG. Multi-criteria decision analysis was chosen for proposing a triage algorithm by generating scores for priority rankings of the clinical importance of SDRs. This study had three main steps. Key attributes for a triage decision were first identified and followed by the development of a signal triage algorithm. After that, the triage algorithm was tested by comparing the triage results of the proposed algorithm with triaging by experts in the SDAWG. Six factors were selected as key attributes, i.e., fatal outcome, serious ADRs, positive rechallenge, new drug, change in number of ADR reports, and source of reports. Four attributes used in the Thai Signal Detection Program were excluded, i.e., the drug-ADR associations, WHO-ART critical term, disproportionality, and volume of reports. Six experts gave the weight for the six key attributes using their experiences, and score criteria were set. To test the proposed triage algorithm, systemic antibiotics with 86 SDRs in total were triaged by the SDAWG, and eight SDRs were chosen for further assessment. Six of them were consistent with the result of the proposed signal triage algorithm (75% agreement) and were the top of the priority ranking. The other two SDRs were selected only by the SDAWG because they were high-concerned and serious ADRs and unfamiliar cases. These could be because of the drug or ADRs of current interest, the level of being key attributes, comorbidity and concurrent medication use, and characteristics of experts’ opinions. The signal triage algorithm can enhance the efficiency of the triage method by experts as it is systematic, transparent, timely, repeatable, and also scientifically based.

DESIGN: Based upon clinical significance to VAERS reviewing physicians, we defined the primary (diagnosis and cause of death) and secondary features (eg, symptoms) for extraction. We built a novel vaccine adverse event text mining (VaeTM) system based on a semantic text mining strategy. The performance of VaeTM was evaluated using a total of 300 VAERS reports in three sequential evaluations of 100 reports each. Moreover, we evaluated the VaeTM contribution to case classification; an information retrieval-based approach was used for the identification of anaphylaxis cases in a set of reports and was compared with two other methods: a dedicated text classifier and an online tool. MEASUREMENTS: The performance metrics of VaeTM were text mining metrics: recall, precision and F-measure.

Previously we developed the Vaccine Adverse Event Text Miner (VaeTM) to offer automated information extraction and potentially accelerate the evaluation of large volumes of unstructured data and facilitate signal detection. OBJECTIVE: To assess how the information extraction performed by VaeTM impacts the accuracy of a medical expert's review of the vaccine adverse event report. METHODS: The ""outcome of interest"" (diagnosis, cause of death, second level diagnosis), ""onset time,"" and ""alternative explanations"" (drug, medical and family history) for the adverse event were extracted from 1000 reports from the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) using the VaeTM system. We compared the human interpretation, by medical experts, of the VaeTM extracted data with their interpretation of the traditional full text reports for these three variables. Two experienced clinicians alternately reviewed text miner output and full text. A third clinician scored the match rate using a predefined algorithm; the proportion of matches and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated. Review time per report was analyzed. RESULTS: Proportion of matches between the interpretation of the VaeTM extracted data, compared to the interpretation of the full text: 93% for outcome of interest (95% CI: 91-94%) and 78% for alternative explanation (95% CI: 75-81%). Extracted data on the time to onset was used in 14% of cases and was a match in 54% (95% CI: 46-63%) of those cases. When supported by structured time data from reports, the match for time to onset was 79% (95% CI: 76-81%). The extracted text averaged 136 (74%) fewer words, resulting in a mean reduction in review time of 50 (58%) seconds per report. CONCLUSION: Despite a 74% reduction in words, the clinical conclusion from VaeTM extracted data agreed with the full text in 93% and 78% of reports for the outcome of interest and alternative explanation, respectively.

FDA-approved drug labeling summarizes ADRs of a drug product mainly in three sections, i.e., Boxed Warning (BW), Warnings and Precautions (WP), and Adverse Reactions (AR), where the severity of ADRs are intended to decrease in the order of BW > WP > AR. Several reported studies have extracted ADRs from labeling documents, but most, if not all, did not discriminate the severity of the ADRs by the different labeling sections. Such a practice could overstate or underestimate the impact of certain ADRs to the public health. In this study, we applied the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) to drug labeling and systematically analyzed and compared the ADRs from the three labeling sections with a specific emphasis on analyzing serious ADRs presented in BW, which is of most drug safety concern. RESULTS: This study investigated New Drug Application (NDA) labeling documents for 1164 single-ingredient drugs using Oracle Text search to extract MedDRA terms. We found that only a small portion of MedDRA Preferred Terms (PTs), 3819 out of 21,920 or 17.42%, were observed in a whole set of documents. In detail, 466/3819 (12.0%) PTs were in BW, 2023/3819 (53.0%) were in WP, and 2961/3819 (77.5%) were in AR sections. We also found a higher overlap of top 20 occurring BW PTs with WP sections compared to AR sections. Within the MedDRA System Organ Class levels, serious ADRs (sADRs) from BW were prevalent in Nervous System disorders and Vascular disorders. A Hierarchical Cluster Analysis (HCA) revealed that drugs within the same therapeutic category shared the same ADR patterns in BW (e.g., nervous system drug class is highly associated with drug abuse terms such as dependence, substance abuse, and respiratory depression). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that combining MedDRA standard terminologies with data mining techniques facilitated computer-aided ADR analysis of drug labeling.

Ontology-based literature mining and class effect analysis of adverse drug reactions associated with neuropathy-inducing drugs,"Hur, J.; Özgür, A.; He, Y.","BACKGROUND: Adverse drug reactions (ADRs), also called as drug adverse events (AEs), are reported in the FDA drug labels; however, it is a big challenge to properly retrieve and analyze the ADRs and their potential relationships from textual data. Previously, we identified and ontologically modeled over 240 drugs that can induce peripheral neuropathy through mining public drug-related databases and drug labels. However, the ADR mechanisms of these drugs are still unclear. In this study, we aimed to develop an ontology-based literature mining system to identify ADRs from drug labels and to elucidate potential mechanisms of the neuropathy-inducing drugs (NIDs). RESULTS: We developed and applied an ontology-based SciMiner literature mining strategy to mine ADRs from the drug labels provided in the Text Analysis Conference (TAC) 2017, which included drug labels for 53 neuropathy-inducing drugs (NIDs). We identified an average of 243 ADRs per NID and constructed an ADR-ADR network, which consists of 29 ADR nodes and 149 edges, including only those ADR-ADR pairs found in at least 50% of NIDs. Comparison to the ADR-ADR network of non-NIDs revealed that the ADRs such as pruritus, pyrexia, thrombocytopenia, nervousness, asthenia, acute lymphocytic leukaemia were highly enriched in the NID network. Our ChEBI-based ontology analysis identified three benzimidazole NIDs (i.e., lansoprazole, omeprazole, and pantoprazole), which were associated with 43 ADRs. Based on ontology-based drug class effect definition, the benzimidazole drug group has a drug class effect on all of these 43 ADRs. Many of these 43 ADRs also exist in the enriched NID ADR network. Our Ontology of Adverse Events (OAE) classification further found that these 43 benzimidazole-related ADRs were distributed in many systems, primarily in behavioral and neurological, digestive, skin, and immune systems. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates that ontology-based literature mining and network analysis can efficiently identify and study specific group of drugs and their associated ADRs.

However, there are minimal reports on the predictors of adverse drug reactions. We attempted to use DT analysis to discover combinations of multiple risk factors that would increase the risk of nephrotoxicity associated with vancomycin (VCM). To demonstrate the usefulness of DT analysis, we compared its predictive performance with that of multiple logistic regression analysis. METHOD: A single-centre, retrospective study was conducted at Hokkaido University Hospital. A total of 592 patients, who received intravenous administrations of VCM between November 2011 and April 2016, were enrolled. Nephrotoxicity was defined as an increase in serum creatinine of ≥0.5 mg/dL or a ≥50% increase in serum creatinine from the baseline. Risk factors for VCM nephrotoxicity were extracted from previous reports. In the DT analysis, a chi-squared automatic interaction detection algorithm was constructed. For evaluating the established algorithms, a 10-fold cross validation method was adopted to calculate the misclassification risk of the model. Moreover, to compare the accuracy of the DT analysis, multiple logistic regression analysis was conducted. RESULTS: Eighty-seven (14.7%) patients developed nephrotoxicity. A VCM trough concentration of ≥15.0 mg/L, concomitant medication (vasopressor drugs and furosemide), and a duration of therapy ≥14 days were extracted to build the DT model, in which the patients were divided into 6 subgroups based on variable rates of nephrotoxicity, ranging from 4.6 to 69.6%.

Metabolic Network Prediction of Drug Side Effects,"Shaked, I.; Oberhardt, M. A.; Atias, N.; Sharan, R.; Ruppin, E.","Summary Drug side effects levy a massive cost on society through drug failures, morbidity, and mortality cases every year, and their early detection is critically important. Here, we describe the array of model-based phenotype predictors (AMPP), an approach that leverages medical informatics resources and a human genome-scale metabolic model (GSMM) to predict drug side effects. AMPP is substantially predictive (AUC > 0.7) for >70 drug side effects, including very serious ones such as interstitial nephritis and extrapyramidal disorders. We evaluate AMPP's predictive signal through cross-validation, comparison across multiple versions of a side effects database, and co-occurrence analysis of drug side effect associations in scientific abstracts (hypergeometric p value = 2.2e-40). AMPP outperforms a previous biochemical structure-based method in predicting metabolically based side effects (aggregate AUC = 0.65 versus 0.59). Importantly, AMPP enables the identification of key metabolic reactions and biomarkers that are predictive of specific side effects. Taken together, this work lays a foundation for future detection of metabolically grounded side effects during early stages of drug development.",2016,,Cell Systems,2,3,209-213,,10.1016/j.cels.2016.03.001,,#4476,Shaked 2016,Exclusion reason: Lack of Pharmacovigilance/Drug Safety; ,""
Identifying Severe Adverse Event Clusters Using the National Cancer Institute's Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events,"Zhong, X.; Lim, E. A.; Hershman, D. L.; Moinpour, C. M.; Unger, J.; Lee, S. M.","PURPOSE: Exploring the relationships among adverse events is important because those that arise from a common mechanism are amenable to a common intervention, which can improve symptom management, quality of life, and treatment adherence. To date, symptom cluster studies have used patient-reported data, which are not always available in clinical trials. In this study, we proposed using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) to identify adverse event clusters because the CTCAE data are collected as standard practice and can therefore be used when patient-reported outcomes are unavailable. METHODS: The CTCAE data from a randomized clinical trial conducted by SWOG that compared docetaxel plus estramustine versus mitoxantrone plus predinsone in patients with advanced prostate cancer were used to identify severe adverse event clusters. A variable based hierarchical cluster analysis was conducted using the CTCAE for the 323 patients who experienced at least one grade 3 or higher adverse event. RESULTS: A total of 109 adverse event types were captured using the CTCAE. Four clusters had moderate associations: nausea, vomiting, and anorexia (n = 35, r = 0.45); joint/bone(myalgia, arthralgia, and arthritis) and muscle weakness (n = 26, r = 0.29); anemia and transfusion (n = 20, r = 0.38); and neutrophils/granulocytes, febrile neutropenia, and leukocytes/lymphopenia (n = 114, r = 0.29). Two clusters had weak associations: fatigue/malaise/lethargy and dehydration (n = 66, r = 0.12); and constipation, infection without neutropenia, and abdominal pain/cramping (n = 35, r = 0.13).

Using data mining to predict safety actions from FDA adverse event reporting system data,"Hochberg, A. M.; Reisinger, S. J.; Pearson, R. K.; O'Hara, D. J.; Hall, K.","Purpose: To determine the value of data mining in early identification of drug safety signals from spontaneous reporting databases. Methods: A single data mining algorithm was applied to the 2001-2003 public release of Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (AERS) data for all therapeutic new molecular entities (NMEs) approved in 2001. The list of detected signals was compared with the list of safety-related regulatory actions for those drugs through February 2006. Results: For the 21 NMEs, 73 signals of interest were detected by data mining. In 39 cases, that signal preceded regulatory action. The median time from approval to signal detection was 11.5 months, and the median time from signal detection to action was 21 months. There were 33 actions for which no signal was detected and 34 signals with no corresponding regulatory action. Conclusion: Using AERS data 2-3 years following approval, more than half of FDA actions that occurred in the next 2-4 years were predicted by data mining, and more than half of the signals detected by data mining corresponded to an FDA action. An appropriate data mining procedure can yield meaningful safety information, often well in advance of regulatory action. Copyright © 2007 Drug Information Association, Inc.

This study aimed to elucidate the factors affecting nilotinib-induced hepatotoxicity. Methods: This retrospective cohort study was performed on patients using nilotinib from July of 2015 to June of 2020. We estimated the odds ratio and adjusted odds ratio from univariate and multivariate analyses, respectively. Several machine learning models were developed to predict risk factors of hepatotoxicity occurrence. The area under the curve (AUC) was analyzed to assess clinical performance. Results: Among 353 patients, the rate of patients with grade I or higher hepatotoxicity after nilotinib administration was 40.8%. Male patients and patients who received nilotinib at a dose of ≥300 mg had a 2.3-fold and a 3.5-fold increased risk for hepatotoxicity compared to female patients and compared with those who received <300 mg, respectively. H2 blocker use decreased hepatotoxicity by 11.6-fold. The area under the curve (AUC) values of machine learning methods ranged between 0.61-0.65 in this study.

Predicting drug side effects with compact integration of heterogeneous networks,"Zhao, X.; Chen, L.; Guo, Z. H.; Liu, T.","Background: The side effects of drugs are not only harmful to humans but also the major reasons for withdrawing approved drugs, bringing greater risks for pharmaceutical companies. However, detecting the side effects for a given drug via traditional experiments is time-consuming and expensive. In recent years, several computational methods have been proposed to predict the side effects of drugs. However, most of the methods cannot effectively integrate the heterogeneous properties of drugs. Methods: In this study, we adopted a network embedding method, Mashup, to extract essential and informative drug features from several drug heterogeneous networks, representing different properties of drugs. For side effects, a network was also built, from where side effect features were extracted. These features can capture essential information about drugs and side effects in a network level. Drug and side effect features were combined together to represent each pair of drug and side effect, which was deemed as a sample in this study. Furthermore, they were fed into a random forest (RF) algorithm to construct the prediction model, called the RF network model. Results: The RF network model was evaluated by several tests. The average of Matthews correlation coefficients on the balanced and unbalanced datasets was 0.640 and 0.641, respectively.

"Reducing drug prescription errors and adverse drug events by application of a probabilistic, machine-learning based clinical decision support system in an inpatient setting","Segal, G.; Segev, A.; Brom, A.; Lifshitz, Y.; Wasserstrum, Y.; Zimlichman, E.","BACKGROUND: Drug prescription errors are made, worldwide, on a daily basis, resulting in a high burden of morbidity and mortality. Existing rule-based systems for prevention of such errors are unsuccessful and associated with substantial burden of false alerts. OBJECTIVE: In this prospective study, we evaluated the accuracy, validity, and clinical usefulness of medication error alerts generated by a novel system using outlier detection screening algorithms, used on top of a legacy standard system, in a real-life inpatient setting. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We integrated a novel outlier system into an existing electronic medical record system, in a single medical ward in a tertiary medical center. The system monitored all drug prescriptions written during 16 months. The department's staff assessed all alerts for accuracy, clinical validity, and usefulness. We recorded all physician's real-time responses to alerts generated. RESULTS: The alert burden generated by the system was low, with alerts generated for 0.4% of all medication orders. Sixty percent of the alerts were flagged after the medication was already dispensed following changes in patients' status which necessitated medication changes (eg, changes in vital signs). Eighty-five percent of the alerts were confirmed clinically valid, and 80% were considered clinically useful. Forty-three percent of the alerts caused changes in subsequent medical orders.

The tool was built around a set of four movement disorders (extrapyramidal side effects [EPSEs]) related to antipsychotic therapy and rules were then generalised such that the tool could be applied to additional ADEs. We report the frequencies of recorded EPSEs in patients diagnosed with a Severe Mental Illness (SMI) and then report performance in identifying eight other unrelated ADEs. RESULTS: The tool identified EPSEs with >0.85 precision and >0.86 recall during testing.

Predicting Adverse Drug Effects from Literature- and Database-Mined Assertions,"La, M. K.; Sedykh, A.; Fourches, D.; Muratov, E.; Tropsha, A.","Introduction: Given that adverse drug effects (ADEs) have led to post-market patient harm and subsequent drug withdrawal, failure of candidate agents in the drug development process, and other negative outcomes, it is essential to attempt to forecast ADEs and other relevant drug–target–effect relationships as early as possible. Current pharmacologic data sources, providing multiple complementary perspectives on the drug–target–effect paradigm, can be integrated to facilitate the inference of relationships between these entities. Objective: This study aims to identify both existing and unknown relationships between chemicals (C), protein targets (T), and ADEs (E) based on evidence in the literature. Materials and Methods: Cheminformatics and data mining approaches were employed to integrate and analyze publicly available clinical pharmacology data and literature assertions interrelating drugs, targets, and ADEs. Based on these assertions, a C–T–E relationship knowledge base was developed. Known pairwise relationships between chemicals, targets, and ADEs were collected from several pharmacological and biomedical data sources. These relationships were curated and integrated according to Swanson’s paradigm to form C–T–E triangles. Missing C–E edges were then inferred as C–E relationships. Results: Unreported associations between drugs, targets, and ADEs were inferred, and inferences were prioritized as testable hypotheses. Several C–E inferences, including testosterone → myocardial infarction, were identified using inferences based on the literature sources published prior to confirmatory case reports. Timestamping approaches confirmed the predictive ability of this inference strategy on a larger scale. Conclusions: The presented workflow, based on free-access databases and an association-based inference scheme, provided novel C–E relationships that have been validated post hoc in case reports. With refinement of prioritization schemes for the generated C–E inferences, this workflow may provide an effective computational method for the early detection of potential drug candidate ADEs that can be followed by targeted experimental investigations.",2018,,Drug Safety,41,11,1059-1072,,10.1007/s40264-018-0688-5,,#5628,La 2018,Exclusion reason: Lack of Pharmacovigilance/Drug Safety; ,""

However, adverse events are frequently due not to medications but to the patients' underlying conditions. Mining to detect ADRs from EHR data must account for confounders. We developed an automated method using natural-language processing (NLP) and a knowledge source to differentiate cases in which the patient's disease is responsible for the event rather than a drug. Our method was applied to 199,920 hospitalization records, concentrating on two serious ADRs: rhabdomyolysis (n = 687) and agranulocytosis (n = 772). Our method automatically identified 75% of the cases, those with disease etiology. The sensitivity and specificity were 93.8% (confidence interval: 88.9-96.7%) and 91.8% (confidence interval: 84.0-96.2%), respectively. The method resulted in considerable saving of time: for every 1 h spent in development, there was a saving of at least 20 h in manual review. The review of the remaining 25% of the cases therefore became more feasible, allowing us to identify the medications that had caused the ADRs.",2012,Aug,Clin Pharmacol Ther,92,2,228-234,22713699,10.1038/clpt.2012.54,,#2116,Haerian 2012,Exclusion reason: Lack of Machine Learning; ,""
From narrative descriptions to MedDRA: automagically encoding adverse drug reactions,"Combi, C.; Zorzi, M.; Pozzani, G.; Moretti, U.; Arzenton, E.","CONTEXT: The collection of narrative spontaneous reports is an irreplaceable source for the prompt detection of suspected adverse drug reactions (ADRs). In such task qualified domain experts manually revise a huge amount of narrative descriptions and then encode texts according to MedDRA standard terminology. The manual annotation of narrative documents with medical terminology is a subtle and expensive task, since the number of reports is growing up day-by-day. OBJECTIVES: Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications can support the work of people responsible for pharmacovigilance. Our objective is to develop NLP algorithms and tools for the detection of ADR clinical terminology. Efficient applications can concretely improve the quality of the experts' revisions. NLP software can quickly analyze narrative texts and offer an encoding (i.e., a list of MedDRA terms) that the expert has to revise and validate. METHODS: MagiCoder, an NLP algorithm, is proposed for the automatic encoding of free-text descriptions into MedDRA terms. MagiCoder procedure is efficient in terms of computational complexity. We tested MagiCoder through several experiments. In the first one, we tested it on a large dataset of about 4500 manually revised reports, by performing an automated comparison between human and MagiCoder encoding. Moreover, we tested MagiCoder on a set of about 1800 reports, manually revised ex novo by some experts of the domain, who also compared automatic solutions with the gold reference standard. We also provide two initial experiments with reports written in English, giving a first evidence of the robustness of MagiCoder w.r.t. the change of the language. RESULTS: For the current base version of MagiCoder, we measured an average recall and precision of 86.9% and 91.8%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: From a practical point of view, MagiCoder reduces the time required for encoding ADR reports. Pharmacologists have only to review and validate the MedDRA terms proposed by the application, instead of choosing the right terms among the 70 K low level terms of MedDRA. Such improvement in the efficiency of pharmacologists' work has a relevant impact also on the quality of the subsequent data analysis. We developed MagiCoder for the Italian pharmacovigilance language. However, our proposal is based on a general approach, not depending on the considered language nor the term dictionary.",2018,Aug,J Biomed Inform,84,,184-199,29981491,10.1016/j.jbi.2018.07.001,,#3135,Combi 2018,Exclusion reason: Lack of Machine Learning; ,""
E-pharmacovigilance: development and implementation of a computable knowledge base to identify adverse drug reactions,"Neubert, A.; Dormann, H.; Prokosch, H. U.; Bürkle, T.; Rascher, W.; Sojer, R.; Brune, K.; Criegee-Rieck, M.","AIMS: Computer-assisted signal generation is an important issue for the prevention of adverse drug reactions (ADRs). However, due to poor standardization of patients' medical data and a lack of computable medical drug knowledge the specificity of computerized decision support systems for early ADR detection is too low and thus those systems are not yet implemented in daily clinical practice. We report on a method to formalize knowledge about ADRs based on the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPCs) and linking them with structured patient data to generate safety signals automatically and with high sensitivity and specificity. METHODS: A computable ADR knowledge base (ADR-KB) that inherently contains standardized concepts for ADRs (WHO-ART), drugs (ATC) and laboratory test results (LOINC) was built. The system was evaluated in study populations of paediatric and internal medicine inpatients. RESULTS: A total of 262 different ADR concepts related to laboratory findings were linked to 212 LOINC terms. The ADR knowledge base was retrospectively applied to a study population of 970 admissions (474 internal and 496 paediatric patients), who underwent intensive ADR surveillance. The specificity increased from 7% without ADR-KB up to 73% in internal patients and from 19.6% up to 91% in paediatric inpatients, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that contextual linkage of patients' medication data with laboratory test results is a useful and reasonable instrument for computer-assisted ADR detection and a valuable step towards a systematic drug safety process.

"Adverse drug event presentation and tracking (ADEPT): semiautomated, high throughput pharmacovigilance using real-world data","Geva, A.; Stedman, J. P.; Manzi, S. F.; Lin, C.; Savova, G. K.; Avillach, P.; Mandl, K. D.","OBJECTIVE: To advance use of real-world data (RWD) for pharmacovigilance, we sought to integrate a high-sensitivity natural language processing (NLP) pipeline for detecting potential adverse drug events (ADEs) with easily interpretable output for high-efficiency human review and adjudication of true ADEs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The adverse drug event presentation and tracking (ADEPT) system employs an open source NLP pipeline to identify in clinical notes mentions of medications and signs and symptoms potentially indicative of ADEs. ADEPT presents the output to human reviewers by highlighting these drug-event pairs within the context of the clinical note. To measure incidence of seizures associated with sildenafil, we applied ADEPT to 149 029 notes for 982 patients with pediatric pulmonary hypertension. RESULTS: Of 416 patients identified as taking sildenafil, NLP found 72 [17%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 14-21] with seizures as a potential ADE. Upon human review and adjudication, only 4 (0.96%, 95% CI 0.37-2.4) patients with seizures were determined to have true ADEs. Reviewers using ADEPT required a median of 89 s (interquartile range 57-142 s) per patient to review potential ADEs. DISCUSSION: ADEPT combines high throughput NLP to increase sensitivity of ADE detection and human review, to increase specificity by differentiating true ADEs from signs and symptoms related to comorbidities, effects of other medications, or other confounders. CONCLUSION: ADEPT is a promising tool for creating gold standard, patient-level labels for advancing NLP-based pharmacovigilance.

The Adverse Drug Reactions From Patient Reports in Social Media Project: Protocol for an Evaluation Against a Gold Standard,"Arnoux-Guenegou, A.; Girardeau, Y.; Chen, X.; Deldossi, M.; Aboukhamis, R.; Faviez, C.; Dahamna, B.; Karapetiantz, P.; Guillemin-Lanne, S.; Lillo-Le Louët, A.; Texier, N.; Burgun, A.; Katsahian, S.","BACKGROUND: Social media is a potential source of information on postmarketing drug safety surveillance that still remains unexploited nowadays. Information technology solutions aiming at extracting adverse reactions (ADRs) from posts on health forums require a rigorous evaluation methodology if their results are to be used to make decisions. First, a gold standard, consisting of manual annotations of the ADR by human experts from the corpus extracted from social media, must be implemented and its quality must be assessed. Second, as for clinical research protocols, the sample size must rely on statistical arguments. Finally, the extraction methods must target the relation between the drug and the disease (which might be either treated or caused by the drug) rather than simple co-occurrences in the posts. OBJECTIVE: We propose a standardized protocol for the evaluation of a software extracting ADRs from the messages on health forums. The study is conducted as part of the Adverse Drug Reactions from Patient Reports in Social Media project. METHODS: Messages from French health forums were extracted. Entity recognition was based on Racine Pharma lexicon for drugs and Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities terminology for potential adverse events (AEs). Natural language processing-based techniques automated the ADR information extraction (relation between the drug and AE entities). The corpus of evaluation was a random sample of the messages containing drugs and/or AE concepts corresponding to recent pharmacovigilance alerts. A total of 2 persons experienced in medical terminology manually annotated the corpus, thus creating the gold standard, according to an annotator guideline. We will evaluate our tool against the gold standard with recall, precision, and f-measure. Interannotator agreement, reflecting gold standard quality, will be evaluated with hierarchical kappa. Granularities in the terminologies will be further explored. RESULTS: Necessary and sufficient sample size was calculated to ensure statistical confidence in the assessed results. As we expected a global recall of 0.5, we needed at least 384 identified ADR concepts to obtain a 95% CI with a total width of 0.10 around 0.5. The automated ADR information extraction in the corpus for evaluation is already finished. The 2 annotators already completed the annotation process. The analysis of the performance of the ADR information extraction module as compared with gold standard is ongoing. CONCLUSIONS: This protocol is based on the standardized statistical methods from clinical research to create the corpus, thus ensuring the necessary statistical power of the assessed results. Such evaluation methodology is required to make the ADR information extraction software useful for postmarketing drug safety surveillance.

Incorporating Unstructured Patient Narratives and Health Insurance Claims Data in Pharmacovigilance: Natural Language Processing Analysis of Patient-Generated Texts About Systemic Lupus Erythematosus,"Matsuda, S.; Ohtomo, T.; Tomizawa, S.; Miyano, Y.; Mogi, M.; Kuriki, H.; Nakayama, T.; Watanabe, S.","BACKGROUND: Gaining insights that cannot be obtained from health care databases from patients has become an important topic in pharmacovigilance. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to demonstrate a use case, in which patient-generated data were incorporated in pharmacovigilance, to understand the epidemiology and burden of illness in Japanese patients with systemic lupus erythematosus. METHODS: We used data on systemic lupus erythematosus, an autoimmune disease that substantially impairs quality of life, from 2 independent data sets. To understand the disease's epidemiology, we analyzed a Japanese health insurance claims database. To understand the disease's burden, we analyzed text data collected from Japanese disease blogs (tōbyōki) written by patients with systemic lupus erythematosus. Natural language processing was applied to these texts to identify frequent patient-level complaints, and term frequency-inverse document frequency was used to explore patient burden during treatment. We explored health-related quality of life based on patient descriptions. RESULTS: We analyzed data from 4694 and 635 patients with systemic lupus erythematosus in the health insurance claims database and tōbyōki blogs, respectively. Based on health insurance claims data, the prevalence of systemic lupus erythematosus is 107.70 per 100,000 persons. Tōbyōki text data analysis showed that pain-related words (eg, pain, severe pain, arthralgia) became more important after starting treatment. We also found an increase in patients' references to mobility and self-care over time, which indicated increased attention to physical disability due to disease progression. CONCLUSIONS: A classical medical database represents only a part of a patient's entire treatment experience, and analysis using solely such a database cannot represent patient-level symptoms or patient concerns about treatments.

We show the usefulness of our approach on 759 structurally and therapeutically diverse drugs and 994 side effects from all human physiological systems. Our approach can be applied to any drug for which a small number of side effect frequencies have been identified, in order to predict the frequencies of further, yet unidentified, side effects.

Prediction of Drug Side Effects with a Refined Negative Sample Selection Strategy,"Liang, H.; Chen, L.; Zhao, X.; Zhang, X.","Drugs are an important way to treat various diseases. However, they inevitably produce side effects, bringing great risks to human bodies and pharmaceutical companies. How to predict the side effects of drugs has become one of the essential problems in drug research. Designing efficient computational methods is an alternative way. Some studies paired the drug and side effect as a sample, thereby modeling the problem as a binary classification problem. However, the selection of negative samples is a key problem in this case. In this study, a novel negative sample selection strategy was designed for accessing high-quality negative samples. Such strategy applied the random walk with restart (RWR) algorithm on a chemical-chemical interaction network to select pairs of drugs and side effects, such that drugs were less likely to have corresponding side effects, as negative samples. Through several tests with a fixed feature extraction scheme and different machine-learning algorithms, models with selected negative samples produced high performance. The best model even yielded nearly perfect performance. These models had much higher performance than those without such strategy or with another selection strategy. Furthermore, it is not necessary to consider the balance of positive and negative samples under such a strategy.",2020,,Comput Math Methods Med,2020,,1573543,32454877,10.1155/2020/1573543,,#5803,Liang 2020,Exclusion reason: Lack of Pharmacovigilance/Drug Safety; ,""
Drug-induced adverse events prediction with the LINCS L1000 data,"Wang, Z.; Clark, N. R.; Ma'ayan, A.","MOTIVATION: Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are a central consideration during drug development. Here we present a machine learning classifier to prioritize ADRs for approved drugs and pre-clinical small-molecule compounds by combining chemical structure (CS) and gene expression (GE) features. The GE data is from the Library of Integrated Network-based Cellular Signatures (LINCS) L1000 dataset that measured changes in GE before and after treatment of human cells with over 20 000 small-molecule compounds including most of the FDA-approved drugs. Using various benchmarking methods, we show that the integration of GE data with the CS of the drugs can significantly improve the predictability of ADRs. Moreover, transforming GE features to enrichment vectors of biological terms further improves the predictive capability of the classifiers. The most predictive biological-term features can assist in understanding the drug mechanisms of action.

Due to the prominent implications to both public health and the pharmaceutical industry, it is of great importance to unravel the molecular mechanisms by which an adverse drug reaction can be potentially elicited. These mechanisms can be investigated by placing the pharmaco-epidemiologically detected adverse drug reaction in an information-rich context and by exploiting all currently available biomedical knowledge to substantiate it. We present a computational framework for the biological annotation of potential adverse drug reactions. First, the proposed framework investigates previous evidences on the drug-event association in the context of biomedical literature (signal filtering). Then, it seeks to provide a biological explanation (signal substantiation) by exploring mechanistic connections that might explain why a drug produces a specific adverse reaction. The mechanistic connections include the activity of the drug, related compounds and drug metabolites on protein targets, the association of protein targets to clinical events, and the annotation of proteins (both protein targets and proteins associated with clinical events) to biological pathways. Hence, the workflows for signal filtering and substantiation integrate modules for literature and database mining, in silico drug-target profiling, and analyses based on gene-disease networks and biological pathways. Application examples of these workflows carried out on selected cases of drug safety signals are discussed.

Comparing the effectiveness of computerized adverse drug event monitoring systems to enhance clinical decision support for hospitalized patients,"Petratos, G. N.; Kim, Y.; Evans, R. S.; Williams, S. D.; Gardner, R.

Requirements are compiled for clinical decision support in pharmacy systems to enhance ADE detection. METHODS: A large tertiary care facility in Utah, with a history of quality improvement using its advanced hospital information system, was leveraged in this study. ICD9-based review of clinical charts (ICD9 System) was compared quantitatively and qualitatively to computer-assisted pharmacist-verified ADEs (ADE Monitor). The capture-recapture statistical method was applied to the data to determine an estimated prevalence of ADEs. RESULTS: A total estimated ADE prevalence of 5.53% (13,420/242,599) was calculated, with the ICD9 system identifying 2,604 or 19.4%, and the ADE monitor 3,386 or 25.2% of all estimated ADEs. Both methods commonly identified 4.9% of all estimated ADEs and matched 62.0% of the time, each having its strength in detecting a slightly different domain of ADEs. 70% of the ADE documentation in the clinical notes was found in the discharge summaries. CONCLUSION: Coupled with spontaneous reporting, computerized methods account for approximately half of all ADEs that can currently be detected. To enhance ADE monitoring and patient safety in a hospitalized setting, pharmacy information systems should incorporate prospective structuring and coding of the text in clinical charts and using that data alongside computer-generated alerts of laboratory results and drug orders.

Except for timely monitoring, epidemic forecasting using the national influenza surveillance data can provide pivotal information for public health response. Objective: We aimed to develop predictive models using machine learning to provide real-time influenza-like illness forecasts. Methods: Using surveillance data of influenza-like illness visits from emergency departments (from the Real-Time Outbreak and Disease Surveillance System), outpatient departments (from the National Health Insurance database), and the records of patients with severe influenza with complications (from the National Notifiable Disease Surveillance System), we developed 4 machine learning models (autoregressive integrated moving average, random forest, support vector regression, and extreme gradient boosting) to produce weekly influenza-like illness predictions for a given week and 3 subsequent weeks. We established a framework of the machine learning models and used an ensemble approach called stacking to integrate these predictions. We trained the models using historical data from 2008-2014.

Of the 43,528 patient-specific drug substances prescribed, 14,736 (33.9 %) were linked with AEs. From these links we identified multiple ADRs (p < 0.05) and found them to occur at similar frequencies, as stated by the manufacturer and in the literature. We showed that drugs displaying similar ADR profiles share targets, and we compared submitted spontaneous AE reports with our findings. For nine of the ten most prescribed antipsychotics in the patient population, larger doses were prescribed to sedated patients than non-sedated patients; five patients exhibited a significant difference (p < 0.05). Finally, we present two cases (p < 0.05) identified by the workflow. The method identified the potentially fatal AE QT prolongation caused by methadone, and a non-described likely ADR between levomepromazine and nightmares found among the hundreds of identified novel links between drugs and AEs (p < 0.05). Conclusions: The developed method can be used to extract dose-dependent ADR information from already collected EPR data. Large-scale AE extraction from EPRs may complement or even replace current drug safety monitoring methods in the future, reducing or eliminating manual reporting and enabling much faster ADR detection. © 2014 The Author(s).",2014,,Drug Safety,37,4,237-247,,10.1007/s40264-014-0145-z,,#2398,Eriksson 2014,Exclusion reason: Lack of Machine Learning; ,""

How these signal detection algorithms (SDAs) perform in an animal health PV database is the subject of this report. Statistical methods and SDAs were assessed against a set of known signals in order to identify which SDAs were most appropriate for signal detection using the Elanco Animal Health PV database. A reference set of adverse events that should signal was created for 31 products across four species. Nine SDAs based on five disproportionality statistical methods were evaluated against the reference set. The performance metrics were sensitivity, precision, specificity, accuracy, and F score. For bovine and porcine products, the Observed-to-Expected (O/E) SDA was the closest in terms of geometric distance to 100% sensitivity and 100% precision. For canine and feline products, the Information Component (IC) SDA was geometrically closest to 100% sensitivity and 100% precision. Principal Component Analysis confirmed that the O/E and IC SDAs were unique performers with respect to one another and other SDAs.

Analysis of spontaneously reported adverse events,"Nakamura, M.","Observational study is necessary for the evaluation of drug effectiveness in clinical practice. In recent years, the use of spontaneous reporting systems (SRS) for adverse drug reactions has increased and they have become an important resource for regulatory science. SRS, being the largest and most well-known databases worldwide, are one of the primary tools used for postmarketing surveillance and pharmacovigilance. To analyze SRS, the US Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) and the Japanese Adverse Drug Event Report Database (JADER) are reviewed. Authorized pharmacovigilance algorithms were used for signal detection, including the reporting odds ratio. An SRS is a passive reporting database and is therefore subject to numerous sources of selection bias, including overreporting, underreporting, and a lack of a denominator. Despite the inherent limitations of spontaneous reporting, SRS databases are a rich resource and data mining index that provide powerful means of identifying potential associations between drugs and their adverse efects. Our results, which are based on the evaluation of SRS databases, provide essential knowledge that could improve our understanding of clinical issues.",2016,,Yakugaku Zasshi,136,4,549-556,,10.1248/yakushi.15-00224-5,,#317,Nakamura 2016,Exclusion reason: Non-English; ,Non-english
Aggregation and analysis of indication-symptom relationships for drugs approved in the USA,"Punyala, A.; Lankapalli, R.; Hindman, D.; Racz, R.","PURPOSE: Drug indications and disease symptoms often confound adverse event reports in real-world datasets, including electronic health records and reports in the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS).

Evaluation of Natural Language Processing (NLP) systems to annotate drug product labeling with MedDRA terminology,"Ly, T.; Pamer, C.; Dang, O.; Brajovic, S.; Haider, S.; Botsis, T.; Milward, D.; Winter, A.; Lu, S.; Ball, R.","INTRODUCTION: The FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) is a primary data source for identifying unlabeled adverse events (AEs) in a drug or biologic drug product's postmarketing phase. Many AE reports must be reviewed by drug safety experts to identify unlabeled AEs, even if the reported AEs are previously identified, labeled AEs. Integrating the labeling status of drug product AEs into FAERS could increase report triage and review efficiency. Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) is the standard for coding AE terms in FAERS cases. However, drug manufacturers are not required to use MedDRA to describe AEs in product labels. We hypothesized that natural language processing (NLP) tools could assist in automating the extraction and MedDRA mapping of AE terms in drug product labels. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We evaluated the performance of three NLP systems, (ETHER, I2E, MetaMap) for their ability to extract AE terms from drug labels and translate the terms to MedDRA Preferred Terms (PTs). Pharmacovigilance-based annotation guidelines for extracting AE terms from drug labels were developed for this study. We compared each system's output to MedDRA PT AE lists, manually mapped by FDA pharmacovigilance experts using the guidelines, for ten drug product labels known as the ""gold standard AE list"" (GSL) dataset. Strict time and configuration conditions were imposed in order to test each system's capabilities under conditions of no human intervention and minimal system configuration. Each NLP system's output was evaluated for precision, recall and F measure in comparison to the GSL. A qualitative error analysis (QEA) was conducted to categorize a random sample of each NLP system's false positive and false negative errors. RESULTS: A total of 417, 278, and 250 false positive errors occurred in the ETHER, I2E, and MetaMap outputs, respectively. A total of 100, 80, and 187 false negative errors occurred in ETHER, I2E, and MetaMap outputs, respectively. Precision ranged from 64% to 77%, recall from 64% to 83% and F measure from 67% to 79%. I2E had the highest precision (77%), recall (83%) and F measure (79%). ETHER had the lowest precision (64%). MetaMap had the lowest recall (64%). The QEA found that the most prevalent false positive errors were context errors such as ""Context error/General term"", ""Context error/Instructions or monitoring parameters"", ""Context error/Medical history preexisting condition underlying condition risk factor or contraindication"", and ""Context error/AE manifestations or secondary complication"". The most prevalent false negative errors were in the ""Incomplete or missed extraction"" error category. Missing AE terms were typically due to long terms, or terms containing non-contiguous words which do not correspond exactly to MedDRA synonyms. MedDRA mapping errors were a minority of errors for ETHER and I2E but were the most prevalent false positive errors for MetaMap. CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrate that it may be feasible to use NLP tools to extract and map AE terms to MedDRA PTs. However, the NLP tools we tested would need to be modified or reconfigured to lower the error rates to support their use in a regulatory setting. Tools specific for extracting AE terms from drug labels and mapping the terms to MedDRA PTs may need to be developed to support pharmacovigilance. Conducting research using additional NLP systems on a larger, diverse GSL would also be informative.",2018,Jul,J Biomed Inform,83,,73-86,29860093,10.1016/j.jbi.2018.05.019,,#2859,Ly 2018,Exclusion reason: Lack of Machine Learning; ,""

Hybrid Semantic Analysis for Mapping Adverse Drug Reaction Mentions in Tweets to Medical Terminology,"Emadzadeh, E.; Sarker, A.; Nikfarjam, A.; Gonzalez, G.","Social networks, such as Twitter, have become important sources for active monitoring of user-reported adverse drug reactions (ADRs). Automatic extraction of ADR information can be crucial for healthcare providers, drug manufacturers, and consumers. However, because of the non-standard nature of social media language, automatically extracted ADR mentions need to be mapped to standard forms before they can be used by operational pharmacovigilance systems. We propose a modular natural language processing pipeline for mapping (normalizing) colloquial mentions of ADRs to their corresponding standardized identifiers. We seek to accomplish this task and enable customization of the pipeline so that distinct unlabeled free text resources can be incorporated to use the system for other normalization tasks. Our approach, which we call Hybrid Semantic Analysis (HSA), sequentially employs rule-based and semantic matching algorithms for mapping user-generated mentions to concept IDs in the Unified Medical Language System vocabulary. The semantic matching component of HSA is adaptive in nature and uses a regression model to combine various measures of semantic relatedness and resources to optimize normalization performance on the selected data source. On a publicly available corpus, our normalization method achieves 0.502 recall and 0.823 precision (F-measure: 0.624).

We retrospectively collected the data from our electronic medical record data warehouse (2007 ~ 2017). AE rate of all 99,861 admissions was 6.2%. The dataset was divided into training and testing datasets from 2007–2015 and 2016–2017 respectively. In real-life clinical care, physiological parameters were not recorded every hour and missed frequently, for example, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS). The expert domain suggested that missed GCS was rated as 15. We took two strategies (stack series records and align by hour) in the data preprocessing and tripling the values of negative samples for class balancing (CB). We used the last 28 hours’ serial data to predict AEs 3 hours later with Random Forest, XGBoost, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). It is shown that CNN with CB and align by hour got the best results comparing to the other methods. The precision, recall and area under curve were 0.841, 0.928 and 0.995 respectively.

However, many SGA-treated patients with MetS remain undetected. In this study, we trained and validated artificial neural network (ANN) and multiple logistic regression models without biochemical parameters to rapidly identify MetS in patients with SGA treatment. METHOD: A total of 383 patients with a diagnosis of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder (DSM-IV criteria) with SGA treatment for more than 6 months were investigated to determine whether they met the MetS criteria according to the International Diabetes Federation. The data for these patients were collected between March 2005 and September 2005. The input variables of ANN and logistic regression were limited to demographic and anthropometric data only. All models were trained by randomly selecting two-thirds of the patient data and were internally validated with the remaining one-third of the data. The models were then externally validated with data from 69 patients from another hospital, collected between March 2008 and June 2008. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was used to measure the performance of all models. RESULTS: Both the final ANN and logistic regression models had high accuracy (88.3% vs 83.6%), sensitivity (93.1% vs 86.2%), and specificity (86.9% vs 83.8%) to identify MetS in the internal validation set.

Adverse Drug Reaction Predictions Using Stacking Deep Heterogeneous Information Network Embedding Approach,"Hu, B.; Wang, H.; Wang, L.; Yuan, W.","Inferring potential adverse drug reactions is an important and challenging task for the drug discovery and healthcare industry. Many previous studies in computational pharmacology have proposed utilizing multi-source drug information to predict drug side effects have and achieved initial success. However, most of the prediction methods mainly rely on direct similarities inferred from drug information and cannot fully utilize the drug information about the impact of protein⁻protein interactions (PPI) on potential drug targets. Moreover, most of the methods are designed for specific tasks. In this work, we propose a novel heterogeneous network embedding approach for learning drug representations called SDHINE, which integrates PPI information into drug embeddings and is generic for different adverse drug reaction (ADR) prediction tasks. To integrate heterogeneous drug information and learn drug representations, we first design different meta-path-based proximities to calculate drug similarities, especially target propagation meta-path-based proximity based on PPI network, and then construct a semi-supervised stacking deep neural network model that is jointly optimized by the defined meta-path proximities. Extensive experiments with three state-of-the-art network embedding methods on three ADR prediction tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the SDHINE model.

Prediction of drug-induced eosinophilia adverse effect by using SVM and naïve Bayesian approaches,"Zhang, H.; Yu, P.; Xiang, M. L.; Li, X. B.; Kong, W. B.; Ma, J. Y.; Wang, J. L.; Zhang, J. P.; Zhang, J.","Drug-induced eosinophilia is a potentially life-threatening adverse effect; clinical manifestations, eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome, mainly include severe skin eruption, fever, hematologic abnormalities, and organ system dysfunction. Using experimental methods to evaluate drug-induced eosinophilia is very complicated, time-consuming, and costly in the early stage of drug development. Thus, in this investigation, we established computational prediction models of drug-induced eosinophilia using SVM and naïve Bayesian approaches. For the SVM modeling, the overall prediction accuracy for the training set by means of fivefold cross-validation is 91.6 and for the external test set is 82.9 %. For the naïve Bayesian modeling, the overall prediction accuracy for the training set is 92.5 and for the external test set is 85.4 %. Moreover, some molecular descriptors and substructures considered as important for drug-induced eosinophilia were identified. Thus, we hope the prediction models of drug-induced eosinophilia built in this work should be applied to filter early-stage molecules for potential eosinophilia adverse effect, and the selected molecular descriptors and substructures of toxic compounds should be taken into consideration in the design of new candidate drugs to help medicinal chemists rationally select the chemicals with the best prospects to be effective and safe.",2016,Mar,Med Biol Eng Comput,54,2-3,361-369,26044554,10.1007/s11517-015-1321-8,,#5806,Zhang 2016,Exclusion reason: Lack of Pharmacovigilance/Drug Safety; ,""
Comparing Machine Learning Algorithms for Predicting Drug-Induced Liver Injury (DILI),"Minerali, E.; Foil, D. H.; Zorn, K. M.; Lane, T. R.; Ekins, S.","Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) is one the most unpredictable adverse reactions to xenobiotics in humans and the leading cause of postmarketing withdrawals of approved drugs. To date, these drugs have been collated by the FDA to form the DILIRank database, which classifies DILI severity and potential. These classifications have been used by various research groups in generating computational predictions for this type of liver injury. Recently, groups from Pfizer and AstraZeneca have collated DILI in vitro data and physicochemical properties for compounds that can be used along with data from the FDA to build machine learning models for DILI. In this study, we have used these data sets, as well as the Biopharmaceutics Drug Disposition Classification System data set, to generate Bayesian machine learning models with our in-house software, Assay Central. The performance of all machine learning models was assessed through both the internal 5-fold cross-validation metrics and prediction accuracy of an external test set of compounds with known hepatotoxicity. The best-performing Bayesian model was based on the DILI-concern category from the DILIRank database with an ROC of 0.814, a sensitivity of 0.741, a specificity of 0.755, and an accuracy of 0.746. A comparison of alternative machine learning algorithms, such as k-nearest neighbors, support vector classification, AdaBoosted decision trees, and deep learning methods, produced similar statistics to those generated with the Bayesian algorithm in Assay Central.

Improved Prediction of Drug-Induced Torsades de Pointes Through Simulations of Dynamics and Machine Learning Algorithms,"Lancaster, M. C.; Sobie, E. A.","The ventricular arrhythmia Torsades de Pointes (TdP) is a common form of drug-induced cardiotoxicity, but prediction of this arrhythmia remains an unresolved issue in drug development. Current assays to evaluate arrhythmia risk are limited by poor specificity and a lack of mechanistic insight. We addressed this important unresolved issue through a novel computational approach that combined simulations of drug effects on dynamics with statistical analysis and machine-learning. Drugs that blocked multiple ion channels were simulated in ventricular myocyte models, and metrics computed from the action potential and intracellular (Ca(2+) ) waveform were used to construct classifiers that distinguished between arrhythmogenic and nonarrhythmogenic drugs. We found that: (1) these classifiers provide superior risk prediction; (2) drug-induced changes to both the action potential and intracellular (Ca(2+) ) influence risk; and (3) cardiac ion channels not typically assessed may significantly affect risk. Our algorithm demonstrates the value of systematic simulations in predicting pharmacological toxicity.",2016,Oct,Clin Pharmacol Ther,100,4,371-379,26950176,10.1002/cpt.367,,#3648,Lancaster 2016,Exclusion reason: Prognostic Task; ,""
Identifying adverse drug reactions associated with drug-drug interactions: Data mining of a spontaneous reporting database in Italy,"Leone, R.; Magro, L.; Moretti, U.; Cutroneo, P.; Moschini, M.; Motola, D.; Tuccori, M.; Conforti, A.","Background: Drug-drug interactions (DDIs) are an important cause of adverse drug reactions (ADRs). Many studies have recently considered this issue, but most of them focus only on potential interactions and are often related to the hospital setting. A spontaneous reporting database could be a valuable resource for detection of ADRs associated with DDIs; however, data in the literature are limited. Objective: To detect those patients treated with potentially interacting drugs and the cases where reported adverse reactions are a possible consequence of DDIs, using an Italian spontaneous reporting database. Methods: The data were obtained from a database containing all reports of suspected ADRs from five Italian regions (January 1990 to December 2007) that are the main contributors to the Italian spontaneous reporting system. All reports containing at least two drugs, reported as being suspected of causing the ADR or as concomitant medication, were selected and a list of drug pairs was drawn up. We performed a search to verify which drug pairs are considered a potential DDI, using the Internet version of the DRUGDEX® system. For each report containing a potential DDI, we verified whether the description of the adverse reaction corresponded to the interaction effect. Results: The database contained 45 315 reports, of which 17 700 (39.1%) had at least two reported drugs. We identified 5345 (30.2%) reports with potential DDIs, and in 1159 (21.7%) of these reports a related ADR was reported. The percentage of reports with potential DDIs increased in relation to the number of concomitantly administered drugs, ranging from 9.8% for two drugs to 88.3% for eight or more drugs. The percentages of serious or fatal reports of ADRs associated with a DDI were significantly higher than other reports analysed. The mean age, percentage of male patients and the mean number of drugs were also significantly higher in reports with DDIs than in other reports. In 235 of 1159 reports (20.3%), both interacting drugs were recognized as suspect by the reporter. This percentage varies in relation to the drugs involved, ranging from 2% to about 65%. The most frequently reported interaction was digoxin and diuretics, but no fatal ADRs were reported with this combination. The combination of anticoagulant and antiplatelet agents was responsible for the greatest number of serious reactions and deaths. Conclusions: This study validates that spontaneous reporting, despite its limitations, can be an important resource for detecting ADRs associated with the concomitant use of interacting drugs. Moreover, our data confirm that DDIs could be a real problem in clinical practice, showing that more than one in five patients exposed to a potential DDI experienced a related ADR. © 2010 Adis Data Information BV.

Automatic extraction of AEs from SPCs is useful for detecting AEs and for building drug databases. However, this task is difficult because each AE is associated with a frequency that must be extracted and the presentation of AEs in SPCs is heterogeneous, consisting of plain text and tables in many different formats. METHODS: We propose a taxonomy for the presentation of AEs in SPCs. We set up natural language processing (NLP) and table parsing methods for extracting AEs from texts and tables of any format, and evaluate them on 10 SPCs. RESULTS: Automatic extraction performed better on tables than on texts.

Detecting Hypoglycemia Incidents Reported in Patients' Secure Messages: Using Cost-Sensitive Learning and Oversampling to Reduce Data Imbalance,"Chen, J.; Lalor, J.; Liu, W.; Druhl, E.; Granillo, E.; Vimalananda, V. G.; Yu, H.","BACKGROUND: Improper dosing of medications such as insulin can cause hypoglycemic episodes, which may lead to severe morbidity or even death. Although secure messaging was designed for exchanging nonurgent messages, patients sometimes report hypoglycemia events through secure messaging. Detecting these patient-reported adverse events may help alert clinical teams and enable early corrective actions to improve patient safety. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to develop a natural language processing system, called HypoDetect (Hypoglycemia Detector), to automatically identify hypoglycemia incidents reported in patients' secure messages. METHODS: An expert in public health annotated 3000 secure message threads between patients with diabetes and US Department of Veterans Affairs clinical teams as containing patient-reported hypoglycemia incidents or not. A physician independently annotated 100 threads randomly selected from this dataset to determine interannotator agreement. We used this dataset to develop and evaluate HypoDetect. HypoDetect incorporates 3 machine learning algorithms widely used for text classification: linear support vector machines, random forest, and logistic regression. We explored different learning features, including new knowledge-driven features. Because only 114 (3.80%) messages were annotated as positive, we investigated cost-sensitive learning and oversampling methods to mitigate the challenge of imbalanced data. RESULTS: The interannotator agreement was Cohen kappa=.976. Using cross-validation, logistic regression with cost-sensitive learning achieved the best performance (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve=0.954, sensitivity=0.693, specificity 0.974, F1 score=0.590). Cost-sensitive learning and the ensembled synthetic minority oversampling technique improved the sensitivity of the baseline systems substantially (by 0.123 to 0.728 absolute gains). Our results show that a variety of features contributed to the best performance of HypoDetect. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the challenge of data imbalance, HypoDetect achieved promising results for the task of detecting hypoglycemia incidents from secure messages.

MUFFIN: Multi-Scale Feature Fusion for Drug-Drug Interaction Prediction,"Chen, Y.; Ma, T.; Yang, X.; Wang, J.; Song, B.; Zeng, X.","MOTIVATION: Adverse drug-drug interactions (DDIs) are crucial for drug research and mainly cause morbidity and mortality. Thus, the identification of potential DDIs is essential for doctors, patients, and the society. Existing traditional machine learning models rely heavily on handcraft features and lack generalization. Recently, the deep learning approaches that can automatically learn drug features from the molecular graph or drug-related network have improved the ability of computational models to predict unknown DDIs. However, previous works utilized large labeled data and merely considered the structure or sequence information of drugs without considering the relations or topological information between drug and other biomedical objects (e.g., gene, disease, and pathway), or considered knowledge graph (KG) without considering the information from the drug molecular structure. RESULTS: Accordingly, to effectively explore the joint effect of drug molecular structure and semantic information of drugs in knowledge graph for DDI prediction, we propose a multi-scale feature fusion deep learning model named MUFFIN. MUFFIN can jointly learn the drug representation based on both the drug-self structure information and the KG with rich bio-medical information. In MUFFIN, we designed a bi-level cross strategy that includes cross- and scalar-level components to fuse multi-modal features well. MUFFIN can alleviate the restriction of limited labeled data on deep learning models by crossing the features learned from large-scale KG and drug molecular graph. We evaluated our approach on three datasets and three different tasks including binary-class, multi-class, and multi-label DDI prediction tasks. The results showed that MUFFIN outperformed other state-of-the-art baselines. AVAILABILITY: The source code and data are available at https://github.com/xzenglab/MUFFIN.

Risk prediction models based on hematological/body parameters for chemotherapy-induced adverse effects in Chinese colorectal cancer patients,"Li, M.; Chen, J.; Deng, Y.; Yan, T.; Gu, H.; Zhou, Y.; Yao, H.; Wei, H.; Chen, W.","PURPOSE: To determine risk factors and develop novel prediction models for chemotherapy-induced adverse effects (CIAEs) in Chinese colorectal cancer (CRC) patients receiving capecitabine. METHODS: A total of 233 Chinese CRC patients receiving post-operative chemotherapy with capecitabine were randomly divided into a training set (70%) and a validation set (30%). CIAE-related hematological/body parameters were screened by univariate logistic regression. Based on a set of factors selected from LASSO (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) logistic regression, stepwise multivariate logistic regression was applied to develop prediction models. Area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and Hosmer-Lemeshow (HL) test were used to evaluate the discriminatory ability and the goodness of fit of each model. RESULTS: In total, 35 variables were identified to be associated with CIAEs in univariate analysis. Developed multivariable models had AUCs (area under curve) ranging from 0.625 to 0.888 and 0.428 to 0.760 in the training and validation set, respectively. The grade ≥ 1 anemia multivariable model achieved the best discriminatory ability with AUC of 0.760 (95%CI: 0.609-0.912) and good calibration with HL P value of 0.450. Then, a nomogram was constructed to predict grade ≥ 1 anemia, which included variables of age, pre-operative hemoglobin count, and pre-operative albumin count, with C-indexes of 0.775 and 0.806 in the training and validation set, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: This study identified valuable hematological/body parameters related to CIAEs. A nomogram based on the multivariable model including three hematological/body predictors can accurately predict grade ≥ 1 anemia, facilitating clinicians to implement personalized medicine early for Chinese CRC patients receiving post-operative chemotherapy for better safety treatment.

Utilizing Twitter data for analysis of chemotherapy,"Zhang, L.; Hall, M.; Bastola, D.","OBJECTIVE: Twitter has become one of the most popular social media platforms that offers real-world insights to healthy behaviors. The purpose of this study was to assess and compare perceptions about chemotherapy of patients and health-care providers through analysis of chemo-related tweets. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cancer-related Twitter accounts and their tweets were obtained through using Tweepy (Python library). Multiple text classification algorithms were tested to identify the models with best performance in classifying the accounts into individual and organization. Chemotherapy-specific tweets were extracted from historical tweetset, and the content of these tweets was analyzed using topic model, sentiment analysis and word co-occurrence network. RESULTS: Using the description in Twitter users' profiles, the accounts related with cancer were collected and coded as individual or organization. We employed Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) network with GloVe word embeddings to identify the user into individuals and organizations with accuracy of 85.2%. 13, 273 and 14,051 publicly available chemotherapy-related tweets were retrieved from individuals and organizations, respectively. The content of the chemo-related tweets was analyzed by text mining approaches. The tweets from individual accounts pertained to personal chemotherapy experience and emotions. In contrast with the personal users, professional accounts had a higher proportion of neutral tweets about side effects. The information about the assessment of response to chemotherapy was deficient from organizations on Twitter. DISCUSSION: Examining chemotherapy discussions on Twitter provide new lens into content and behavioral patterns associated with treatments for cancer patients. The methodology described herein allowed us to collect relatively large number of health-related tweets over a greater time period and exploit the potential power of social media, which provide comprehensive view on patients' perceptions of chemotherapy.

Predicting Drug-Induced Liver Injury Using Machine Learning on a Diverse Set of Predictors,"Adeluwa, T.; McGregor, B.

One such side effect, drug-induced liver injury (DILI), is considered a primary factor in regulatory clearance. The Critical Assessment of Massive Data Analysis (CAMDA) 2020 CMap Drug Safety Challenge goal was to develop prediction models based on gene perturbation of six preselected cell-lines (CMap L1000), extended structural information (MOLD2), toxicity data (TOX21), and FDA reporting of adverse events (FAERS). Four types of DILI classes were targeted, including two clinically relevant scores and two control classifications, designed by the CAMDA organizers. The L1000 gene expression data had variable drug coverage across cell lines with only 247 out of 617 drugs in the study measured in all six cell types. We addressed this coverage issue by using Kru-Bor ranked merging to generate a singular drug expression signature across all six cell lines. These merged signatures were then narrowed down to the top and bottom 100, 250, 500, or 1,000 genes most perturbed by drug treatment. These signatures were subject to feature selection using Fisher's exact test to identify genes predictive of DILI status. Models based solely on expression signatures had varying results for clinical DILI subtypes with an accuracy ranging from 0.49 to 0.67 and Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) values ranging from -0.03 to 0.1.

Signal detection in the pharmaceutical industry: Integrating clinical and computational approaches,"Hauben, M.","Drug safety profiles are dynamic and established over time using multiple, complimentary datasets and tools. The principal concern of pharmacovigilance is the detection of adverse drug reactions that are novel by virtue of their clinical nature, severity and/or frequency as soon as possible with minimum patient exposure. A key step in the process is the detection of 'signals' that direct safety reviewers to associations that might be worthy of further investigation. Although the 'prepared mind' remains the cornerstone of signal detection safety reviewers seeking potential signals by scrutinising very large, sparse databases may find themselves 'drowning in data but thirsty for knowledge'. Understandably, health authorities, pharmaceutical companies and academic centres are developing, testing and/or deploying computer-assisted database screening tools (also known as data-mining algorithms [DMAs]) to assist human reviewers. The most commonly used DMAs involve disproportionality analysis that project high-dimensional data onto two-dimensional (2 x 2) contingency tables in the context of an independence model. The objective of this paper is to extend the discussion of the evaluation, potential utility and limitations of the commonly used DMAs by providing a 'holistic' perspective on their use as one component of a comprehensive suite of signal detection strategies incorporating clinical and statistical approaches to signal detection - a marriage of technology and the 'prepared mind'. Data-mining exercises involving spontaneous reports submitted to the US FDA will be used for illustration. Potential pitfalls and obstacles to the acceptance and implementation of data mining will be considered and suggestions for future research will be offered. © 2007 Adis Data Information BV.

Ontology-based systematic representation and analysis of traditional Chinese drugs against rheumatism,"Liu, Q.; Wang, J.; Zhu, Y.; He, Y.","BACKGROUND: Rheumatism represents any disease condition marked with inflammation and pain in the joints, muscles, or connective tissues. Many traditional Chinese drugs have been used for a long time to treat rheumatism. However, a comprehensive information source for these drugs is still missing, and their anti-rheumatism mechanisms remain unclear. An ontology for anti-rheumatism traditional Chinese drugs would strongly support the representation, analysis, and understanding of these drugs. RESULTS: In this study, we first systematically collected reported information about 26 traditional Chinese decoction pieces drugs, including their chemical ingredients and adverse events (AEs). By mostly reusing terms from existing ontologies (e.g., TCMDPO for traditional Chinese medicines, NCBITaxon for taxonomy, ChEBI for chemical elements, and OAE for adverse events) and making semantic axioms linking different entities, we developed the Ontology of Chinese Medicine for Rheumatism (OCMR) that includes over 3000 class terms. Our OCMR analysis found that these 26 traditional Chinese decoction pieces are made from anatomic entities (e.g., root and stem) from 3 Bilateria animals and 23 Mesangiospermae plants. Anti-inflammatory and antineoplastic roles are important for anti-rheumatism drugs. Using the total of 555 unique ChEBI chemical entities identified from these drugs, our ChEBI-based classification analysis identified 18 anti-inflammatory, 33 antineoplastic chemicals, and 9 chemicals (including 3 diterpenoids and 3 triterpenoids) having both anti-inflammatory and antineoplastic roles. Furthermore, our study detected 22 diterpenoids and 23 triterpenoids, including 16 pentacyclic triterpenoids that are likely bioactive against rheumatism. Six drugs were found to be associated with 184 unique AEs, including three AEs (i.e., dizziness, nausea and vomiting, and anorexia) each associated with 5 drugs. Several chemical entities are classified as neurotoxins (e.g., diethyl phthalate) and allergens (e.g., eugenol), which may explain the formation of some TCD AEs. The OCMR could be efficiently queried for useful information using SPARQL scripts. CONCLUSIONS: The OCMR ontology was developed to systematically represent 26 traditional anti-rheumatism Chinese drugs and their related information. The OCMR analysis identified possible anti-rheumatism and AE mechanisms of these drugs. Our novel ontology-based approach can also be applied to systematic representation and analysis of other traditional Chinese drugs.",2017,Dec 21,BMC Syst Biol,11,Suppl 7,130,29322929,10.1186/s12918-017-0510-5,,#5157,Liu 2017,Exclusion reason: Lack of Machine Learning; ,""
Multi-country rapid adverse drug event assessment: the Asian Pharmacoepidemiology Network (AsPEN) antipsychotic and acute hyperglycaemia study,"Pratt, N.; Andersen, M.; Bergman, U.; Choi, N.

E.","PURPOSE: To undertake a multi-country study to investigate the risk of acute hyperglycaemia with antipsychotic use. METHODS: Using a distributed network model with a common minimal data set, we performed a prescription sequence symmetry analysis (PSSA) to investigate the risk of acute hyperglycaemia associated with antipsychotic initiation. Incident insulin prescriptions were used as a proxy indicator of acute hyperglycaemia. Participating countries and population datasets included Australia (300,000 persons), Japan I (300,000 persons), Japan II (200,000 persons), Korea (53 million persons) Taiwan (1 million persons), Sweden (9 million persons), USA-Public (87 million persons) and USA-Private (47 million persons). RESULTS: Olanzapine showed a trend towards increased risk in most databases, with a significant association observed in the USA-Public database (Adjusted sequence ratio (ASR) = 1.14; 95% Confidence Interval (CI) 1.10-1.17) and Sweden (ASR = 1.53; 95% CI 1.13-2.06). Null or negative associations were observed for haloperidol, quetiapine and risperidone. CONCLUSION: Acute hyperglycaemia appears to be associated with olanzapine use, however, this effect was only observed in two large databases.

Systems biology approaches for identifying adverse drug reactions and elucidating their underlying biological mechanisms,"Boland, M. R.; Jacunski, A.; Lorberbaum, T.; Romano, J. D.; Moskovitch, R.; Tatonetti, N. P.","Small molecules are indispensable to modern medical therapy. However, their use may lead to unintended, negative medical outcomes commonly referred to as adverse drug reactions (ADRs). These effects vary widely in mechanism, severity, and populations affected, making ADR prediction and identification important public health concerns. Current methods rely on clinical trials and postmarket surveillance programs to find novel ADRs; however, clinical trials are limited by small sample size, whereas postmarket surveillance methods may be biased and inherently leave patients at risk until sufficient clinical evidence has been gathered. Systems pharmacology, an emerging interdisciplinary field combining network and chemical biology, provides important tools to uncover and understand ADRs and may mitigate the drawbacks of traditional methods. In particular, network analysis allows researchers to integrate heterogeneous data sources and quantify the interactions between biological and chemical entities. Recent work in this area has combined chemical, biological, and large-scale observational health data to predict ADRs in both individual patients and global populations. In this review, we explore the rapid expansion of systems pharmacology in the study of ADRs. We enumerate the existing methods and strategies and illustrate progress in the field with a model framework that incorporates crucial data elements, such as diet and comorbidities, known to modulate ADR risk.

Methods: This retrospective analysis was conducted in 1,063 cancer patients who received ICIs between 2011 and 2017. We identified irAEs by manual review of medical records to determine the incidence of each of our endpoints, namely colitis, hepatitis, pneumonitis, other irAE, or no irAE.

AI and SAR approaches for predicting chemical carcinogenicity: survey and status report,"Richardt, A. M.; Benigni, R.","A wide variety of artificial intelligence (AI) and structure-activity relationship (SAR) approaches have been applied to tackling the general problem of predicting rodent chemical carcinogenicity. Given the diversity of chemical structures and mechanisms relative to this endpoint, the shared challenge of these approaches is to accurately delineate classes of active chemicals representing distinct biological and chemical mechanism domains, and within those classes determine the structural features and properties responsible for modulating activity. In the following discussion, we present a survey of AI and SAR approaches that have been applied to the prediction of rodent carcinogenicity, and discuss these in general terms and in the context of the results of two organized prediction exercises (PTE-1 and PTE-2) sponsored by the US National Cancer Institute/National Toxicology Program. Most models participating in these exercises were successful in identifying major structural-alerting classes of active carcinogens, but failed in modeling the more subtle modifiers to activity within those classes. In addition, methods that incorporated mechanism-based reasoning or biological data along with structural information outperformed models limited to structural information exclusively. Finally, a few recent carcinogenicity-modeling efforts are presented illustrating progress in tackling some aspects of the carcinogenicity prediction problem. The first example, a QSAR model for predicting carcinogenic potency of aromatic amines, illustrates that success is possible within well-represented classes of carcinogens. From the second example, a newly developed FDA/OTR MultiCASE model for predicting the carcinogenicity of pharmaceuticals, we conclude that the definitions of biological activity and nature of chemicals in the training set are important determinants of the predictive success and specificity/sensitivity characteristics of a derived model.",2002,Mar,SAR QSAR Environ Res,13,1,1-19,12074379,10.1080/10629360290002055,,#239,Richardt 2002,Exclusion reason: Full Text Not Found; ,""
Batch and data streaming classification models for detecting adverse events and understanding the influencing factors,"Shi, D. H.; Zurada, J.; Karwowski, W.; Guan, J.; Cakit, E.","Constructing effective models for detecting, reducing, and/or preventing adverse events is very important in domains such as aviation safety, healthcare, drug administration, and war theaters. This study presents batch and data streaming models to detecting adverse events using data from a war theater context. In all the previous studies, regression models and several machine learning techniques were used for predicting continuous values in an active theater of war, and the error values reported on the test sets were large. In order to overcome the shortcoming, this study investigates the effectiveness of batch and data streaming classification algorithms in detecting or classifying adverse events given infrastructure development spending data and other variables in an active theater of war in Afghanistan. By the feature selection, the valid input variables are obtained and their indexes show that the input variables are mainly the adverse events (t-1) at the previous month, the population densities and related project investments. From the country level, fewer of the 14 project investments affect the adverse events. From the region level, some projects with higher index values, such as Security in the South Western region, Energy and Emergency Assistance in the North Eastern region, and Education in the Eastern region are mainly affecting factors. Three batch classification methods and three data streaming classification methods were assessed for their ability to detect adverse events given infrastructure development data. The study uses cost-sensitive measures to address the very unbalanced nature of the data and it applies variable reduction techniques to identify significant variables. The three batch classification algorithms are C4.5, k-nearest Neighbor, and Support Vector Machine. The three data streaming algorithms are Naive Bayes, Hoeffding Tree, and Single Classifier Drift. In general, the performance of the cost-sensitive methods in the batch setting is comparable to those in the data stream setting. However, in the batch setting the cost matrix needs to be adjusted manually. In contrast the data stream setting allows one to adjust the models based on the analysis of the classifiers' performance over time and changing data distribution. The Kappa values using Naive Bayes are the highest in the three data stream algorithms in the whole country and its regions. The Naive Bayes classifier has the best global performance. By the Kappa statistic curve, we can observe the concept drifts. In a region level, many models have a better performance including more investments related to project compared with those in a country level. In addition as data distribution becomes more balanced, the classifiers in the data stream setting outperform in terms of the overall classification rates in comparison to the classifiers in the batch setting. The results thus demonstrate the potential of data streaming algorithms to significantly outperform when the data become less unbalanced, and can be used for detecting adverse events in similar areas.",2019,Oct,Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence,85,,72-84,WOS:000488994300006,10.1016/j.engappai.2019.05.006,,#746,Shi 2019,Exclusion reason: Full Text Not Found; ,""
Angiotensin receptor blockers and the risk of cancer: Data mining of a spontaneous reporting database and a claims database,"Fujimoto, M.; Kanou, M.; Hosomi, K.; Takada, M.","Objective: The aim of this study was to examine the associations between angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) and the risk of 10 major cancers by employing different pharmacoepidemiological assessments. Materials & methods: Data from the first quarter of 2004 through 2012 were downloaded from the US Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS). The reporting odds ratio (ROR) and information component (IC) were used to detect the signals. Furthermore, symmetry analysis was applied to the claims database to identify the risk of cancer after using ARBs from January 2005 to July 2013. Results: Significant inverse associations were found for all cancer types assessed as a whole (ROR: 0.78, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.75 - 0.80; IC: -0.36, 95% CI: -0.40 to -0.31) in the analyses of FAERS database.

In addition, a significantly decreased risk for breast cancer and increased risks for pancreatic and prostate cancer were found in patients treated with ARBs in the analyses of individual cancers. Conclusions: Significant inverse association was found between ARB use and all cancer types assessed as a whole.

Biomedical event trigger detection with convolutional highway neural network and extreme learning machine,"Shen, C.; Lin, H. F.; Fan, X. C.; Chu, Y. H.; Yang, Z. H.; Wang, J.; Zhang, S. W.","Detecting biomedical events in text plays a critical role in building natural language processing applications, such as in medical search, disease prevention, and pharmacovigilance. Since an event trigger can signify the occurrence of the event, the detection of biomedical event triggers is a critical step in biomedical event extraction. Current methods usually extract rich features and then feed these features to a classifier. To enhance both automatic feature selection and classification, this paper presented an end-to-end convolutional highway neural network and extreme learning machine (CHNN-ELM) framework to detect biomedical event triggers. This structure has two stages. In the first stage, CHNN is used to efficiently select higher level semantic features based on four different dimensions: embedding, convolutional layer, pooling layer, and highway layer. In the second stage, the proposed model leverages ELM, which has great scalability and generalization performance, to identify various types of biomedical event triggers. Extensive experiments are conducted on the Multi-Level Event Extraction (MLEE) dataset. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first to introduce ELM into this task.

The goals were to build a system facilitating the study of adverse drug events, to make it easier to find possible explanations, and to group similar drug-drug interaction cases in the adverse drug reaction reports from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). METHODS: We developed a system that analyses adverse drug reaction (ADR) cases reported by the FDA. The system contains four modules. First, we integrate drug and drug target databases that provide information related to adverse drug reactions. Second, we classify drug and drug targets according to anatomical therapeutic chemical classification (ATC) and drug target ontology (DTO). Third, we build drug target networks based on drug and drug target databases. Finally, we apply topological analysis to reveal drug interaction complexity for each ADR case reported by the FDA. RESULTS: We picked 1952 ADR cases from the years 2005-2006. Our dataset consisted of 1952 cases, of which 1471 cases involved ADR targets, 845 cases involved absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) targets, and 507 cases involved some drugs acting on the same targets, namely, common targets (CTs). We then investigated the cases involving ADR targets, ADME targets, and CTs using the ATC system and DTO. In the cases that led to death, the average number of common targets (NCTs) was 0.879 and the average of average clustering coefficient (ACC) was 0.067. In cases that did not lead to death, the average NCTs was 0.551, and the average of ACC was 0.039. CONCLUSIONS: We implemented a system that can find possible explanations and cluster similar ADR cases reported by the FDA. We found that the average of ACC and the average NCTs in cases leading to death are higher than in cases not leading to death, suggesting that the interactions in cases leading to death are generally more complicated than in cases not leading to death.

Analysis of Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors Associated with QT Prolongation and Torsade de Pointes Adverse Events Based on Data Mining Methods,"Pan, L. Y.; Tang, X. W.; Ji, H. H.; Jia, Y. T.","OBJECTIVE: To excavate and evaluate the risk signals of QT prolongation and torsade de pointes(TdP) induced by selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors(SSRIs), provide references for clinical use. METHODS: Data from FDA adverse event reporting system (FAERS, from January 2004 through June 2018) were analyzed for each SSRIs, including fluoxetine, sertraline, citalopram, escitalopram, paroxetine, and fluvoxamine. When QT prolongation and TdP cases were identified using preferred terms (PT) and standardised MedDRA queries (SMQ), three different data mining algorithms were used to detect signalsreporting odds ratio (ROR), medicines and healthcare products regulatory agency (MHRA), and bayesian confidence popagation neural network (BCPNN), if all the three algorithms were positive, suggesting the generation of signals. RESULTS: A total of 3 912 reports of QT prolongation and TdP associated with SSRIs were retrieved through the SMQ. Among which, more females than males(2 349 vs. 1 150), mainly aged 18-44 and 45-64 years, and 90.64% were serious adverse events. The signals were found for fluoxetine, sertraline, citalopram, escitalopram, paroxetine and fluvoxamine at the SMQ level, the RORs (95%CI) were 5.25(4.79-5.76), 2.08(1.79-2.27), 2.86(6.32-7.44), 3.41(3.03-3.84), 2.09(1.84-2.37) and 10.44(8.17-13.33) respectively; the PRRs (X2) were 5.20(1 494.43), 2.01(140.41), 6.77(2 911.71), 3.93(462.34), 2.09(136.58) and 10.21(538.26) respectively; the Ics (IC-2SD) were 2.15(2.12), 1.54(1.52), 2.67(2.65), 2.34(2.31) 1.14(1.12) and 3.16(3.10) respectively.

Exploring Joint AB-LSTM With Embedded Lemmas for Adverse Drug Reaction Discovery,"Santiso, S.; Perez, A.; Casillas, A.","This work focuses on the detection of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) in electronic health records (EHRs) written in Spanish. The World Health Organization underlines the importance of reporting ADRs for patients' safety. The fact is that ADRs tend to be under-reported in daily hospital praxis. In this context, automatic solutions based on text mining can help to alleviate the workload of experts. Nevertheless, these solutions pose two challenges: 1) EHRs show high lexical variability, the characterization of the events must be able to deal with unseen words or contexts and 2) ADRs are rare events, hence, the system should be robust against skewed class distribution. To tackle these challenges, deep neural networks seem appropriate because they allow a high-level representation. Specifically, we opted for a joint AB-LSTM network, a sub-class of the bidirectional long short-term memory network. Besides, in an attempt to reinforce lexical variability, we proposed the use of embeddings created using lemmas.

Since traditional post-marketing surveillance systems based on spontaneous reports have a serious underreporting issue, in recent years research on the detection of adverse reaction events using social media such as Twitter as a data source has attracted increasing attention in recent year. Deep learning models usually rely on a large number of training samples. However, due to the characteristics of user-generated content and the time-consuming data annotation process, related research is faced with the problems caused by small-scale annotated datasets, which restricts deep learning models in achieving satisfactory results. Accordingly, we introduce two regularization methods are introduced at the representation level, i.e., graph embedding-based data augmentation and adversarial training, to improve the performance of detecting adverse events under such conditions.

Adverse drug event detection and extraction from open data: A deep learning approach,"Fan, B.; Fan, W. G.; Smith, C.; Garner, H.","Drug prescription is a task that doctors face daily with each patient. However, when prescribing drugs, doctors must be conscious of all potential drug side effects. In fact, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, adverse drug events (ADEs), or harmful side effects, account for 1/3 of total hospital admissions each year. The goal of this research is to utilize novel deep learning methods for accurate detection and identification of professionally unreported drug side effects using widely available public data (open data). Utilizing a manually-labelled dataset of 10,000 reviews gathered from WebMD and Drugs.com , this research proposes a deep learning-based approach utilizing Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) based models for ADE detection and extraction and compares results to standard deep learning models and current state-of-the-art extraction models. By utilizing a hybrid of transfer learning from pre-trained BERT representations and sentence embeddings, the proposed model achieves an AUC score of 0.94 for ADE detection and an F1 score of 0.97 for ADE extraction. Previous state of the art deep learning approach achieves an AUC of 0.85 in ADE detection and an F1 of 0.82 in ADE extraction on our dataset of review texts. The results show that a BERT-based model achieves new state-of-the-art results on both the ADE detection and extraction task. This approach can be applied to multiple healthcare and information extraction tasks and used to help solve the problem that doctors face when prescribing drugs. Overall, this research introduces a novel dataset utilizing social media health forum data and shows the viability and capability of using deep learning techniques in ADE detection and extraction as well as information extraction as a whole.

Detection and Analysis of Safety Signals of Chloroquine Based Upon FDA Adverse Event Database,"Hu, X.; Hong, D. S.; Yang, H. Y.; Zheng, D. S.; Zhao, Q. W.","OBJECTIVE: To analyze and evaluate the safety signals of chloroquine in the patients, and to provide a valuable reference for rational use in clinic. METHODS: Both the reporting odds ratio (ROR) method and Bayesian confidence propagation neural network (BCPNN) were applied to analyze safety signals of chloroquine based upon the adverse drug events (ADEs) data ranging from 2004 to 2020 as reported in the Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and to systematically assesse the safety signals of chloroquine phosphate on various organs systems. RESULTS: Among the 2 063 reports of ADEs studied, 557 reports were considered to be mainly caused by chloroquine. The results demonstrated that the high-risk ADEs signals of chloroquine involved various systems, such as atrioventricular block complete (ROR=2.90, IC-2SD=1.64), ventricular fibrillation (ROR=3.40, IC-2SD=1.27), blindness (ROR=27.51, IC-2SD=0.55), cardiogenic shock (ROR=6.86, IC-2SD=0.54), vomiting (ROR=1.70, IC-2SD=1.83). Moreover, some rare ADEs with high-risk signals showed a correlation with chloroquine, including hypokalaemia (ROR=4.18,IC-2SD=1.51), renal failure acute (ROR=3.08, IC-2SD=0.30), methaemoglobinaemia (ROR=4.37, IC-2SD=0.03), and pyrexia (ROR=1.80, IC-2SD=1.84), which were consistent with literature reports. However, these ADEs were not listed in instruction and worth much attention in clinic. Moreover, basic diseases of patients and drug incompatibility need much attention to prevent the occurrence and exacerbation of chloroquine-related adverse reactions.

Additional prescriptions, however, may worsen the existing condition or introduce additional adverse effects (AEs). Timely detection and prevention of detrimental PCs is essential as drug AEs are among the leading causes of hospitalization and deaths. Identifying detrimental PCs would enable warnings and contraindications to be disseminated and assist the detection of unknown drug AEs. Nonetheless, the detection is difficult and has been limited to case reports or case assessment using administrative health claims data. Social media is a promising source for detecting signals of detrimental PCs due to the public availability of many discussions regarding treatments and drug AEs. Objective In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of detecting detrimental PCs from social media. Methods The detection, however, is challenging due to the data uncertainty and data rarity in social media. We propose a framework to mine sequences of drugs and AEs that signal detrimental PCs, taking into account the data uncertainty and data rarity. Results We conduct experiments on two real-world datasets collected from Twitter and Patient health forum. Our framework achieves encouraging results in the validation against known detrimental PCs (F1 = 78% for Twitter and 68% for Patient) and the detection of unknown potential detrimental PCs (Precision@50 = 72% and NDCG@50 = 95% for Twitter, Precision@50 = 86% and NDCG@50 = 98% for Patient).

Detecting potential signals of adverse drug events from prescription data,"Zhan, C.; Roughead, E.; Liu, L.; Pratt, N.; Li, J.","Adverse drug events (ADEs) may occur and lead to severe consequences for the public, even though clinical trials are conducted in the stage of pre-market. Computational methods are still needed to fulfil the task of pharmacosurveillance. In post-market surveillance, the spontaneous reporting system (SRS) has been widely used to detect suspicious associations between medicines and ADEs. However, the passive mechanism of SRS leads to the hysteresis in ADE detection by SRS based methods, not mentioning the acknowledged problem of under-reporting and duplicate reporting in SRS. Therefore, there is a growing demand for other complementary methods utilising different types of healthcare data to assist with global pharmacosurveillance. Among those data sources, prescription data is of proved usefulness for pharmacosurveillance. However, few works have used prescription data for signalling ADEs. In this paper, we propose a data-driven method to discover medicines that are responsible for a given ADE purely from prescription data. Our method uses a logistic regression model to evaluate the associations between up to hundreds of suspected medicines and an ADE spontaneously and selects the medicines possessing the most significant associations via Lasso regularisation. To prepare data for training the logistic regression model, we adapt the design of the case-crossover study to construct case time and control time windows for the extraction of medicine use information. While the case time window can be readily determined, we propose several criteria to select the suitable control time windows providing the maximum power of comparisons. In order to address confounding situations, we have considered diverse factors in medicine utilisation in terms of the temporal effect of medicine and the frequency of prescription, as well as the individual effect of patients on the occurrence of an ADE. To assess the performance of the proposed method, we conducted a case study with a real-world prescription dataset. Validated by the existing domain knowledge, our method successfully traced a wide range of medicines that are potentially responsible for the ADE.

J.; Russek-Cohen, E.","The Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) and other product surveillance systems compile reports of product-associated adverse events (AEs), and these reports may include a wide range of information including age, gender, and concomitant vaccines. Controlling for possible confounding variables such as these is an important task when utilizing surveillance systems to monitor post-market product safety. A common method for handling possible confounders is to compare observed product–AE combinations with adjusted baseline frequencies where the adjustments are made by stratifying on observable characteristics. Though approaches such as these have proven to be useful, in this article we propose a more flexible logistic regression approach which allows for covariates of all types rather than relying solely on stratification. Indeed, a main advantage of our approach is that the general regression framework provides flexibility to incorporate additional information such as demographic factors and concomitant vaccines. As part of our covariate-adjusted method, we outline a procedure for signal detection that accounts for multiple comparisons and controls the overall Type 1 error rate. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we illustrate our method with an example involving febrile convulsion, and we further evaluate its performance in a series of simulation studies.",2017,,Journal of Biopharmaceutical Statistics,27,6,990-1008,,10.1080/10543406.2017.1295250,,#4232,Nam 2017,Exclusion reason: Full Text Not Found; ,""
Making Sense of Pharmacovigilance and Drug Adverse Event Reporting: Comparative Similarity Association Analysis Using AI Machine Learning Algorithms in Dogs and Cats,"Xu, X.; Mazloom, R.; Goligerdian, A.; Staley, J.; Amini, M.; Wyckoff, G. J.; Riviere, J.; Jaberi-Douraki, M.","Drug-associated adverse events cause approximately 30 billion dollars a year of added health care expense, along with negative health outcomes including patient death. This constitutes a major public health concern. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requires drug labeling to include potential adverse effects for each newly developed drug product. With the advancement in incidence of adverse drug events (ADEs) and potential adverse drug events, published studies have mainly concluded potential ADEs from labeling documents obtained from the FDA's preapproval clinical trials, and very few analyzed their research work based on reported ADEs after widespread use of a drug to animal subjects. The aforesaid procedure of deriving practice based on information from preapproval labeling may misrepresent or deprecate the incidence and prevalence of specific ADEs. In this study, we make the most of the recently disseminated ADE data by the FDA for animal drugs and devices used in animals to address this public and welfare concern. For this purpose, we implemented 5 different methods (Pearson distance, Spearman distance, cosine distance, Yule distance, and Euclidean distance) to determine the most efficient and robust approach to properly discover highly associated ADEs from the reported data and accurately exclude noise-induced reported events, while maintaining a high level of correlation precision. Our comparative analysis of ADEs based on an artificial intelligence (AI) approach for the 5 robust similarity methods revealed high ADE associations for 2 drugs used in dogs and cats. In addition, the described distance methods systematically analyzed and compared ADEs from the drug labeling sections with a specific emphasis on analyzing serious ADEs. Our finding showed that the cosine method significantly outperformed all the other methods by correctly detecting and validating ADEs based on the comparative similarity association analysis compared with ADEs reported by preapproval clinical trials, premarket testing, or postapproval complication experience of FDA-approved animal drugs.",2019,Dec,Top Companion Anim Med,37,,100366,31837760,10.1016/j.tcam.2019.100366,,#4386,Xu 2019,Exclusion reason: Full Text Not Found; ,""
Mining heterogeneous networks with topological features constructed from patient-contributed content for pharmacovigilance,"Yang, C. C.; Yang, H.","Drug safety, also called pharmacovigilance, represents a serious health problem all over the world. Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) and drug-drug interactions (DDIs) are two important issues in pharmacovigilance, and how to detect drug safety signals has drawn many researchers' attention and efforts. Currently, methods proposed for ADR and DDI detection are mainly based on traditional data sources such as spontaneous reporting data, electronic health records, pharmaceutical databases, and biomedical literature. However, these data sources are either limited by under-reporting ratio, privacy issues, high cost, or long publication cycle. In this study, we propose a framework for drug safety signal detection by harnessing online health community data, a timely, informative, and publicly available data source. Concretely, we used MedHelp as the data source to collect patient-contributed content based on which a weighted heterogeneous network was constructed. We extracted topological features from the network, quantified them with different weighting methods, and used supervised learning method for both ADR and DDI signal detection. In addition, after identifying DDI signals, we proposed a new metric, named Interaction Ratio, to identify associated ADRs due to suspected interactions.

A Pharmaco-Cybernetics Approach to Patient Safety: Identifying Adverse Drug Reactions through Unsupervised Machine Learning,"Yap, K. Y. L.; Informat Resources Management, Assoc","Pharmaco-cybernetics is an upcoming interdisciplinary field that supports our use of medicines and drugs through the combined use of computational technologies and techniques with human-computer-environment interactions to reduce or prevent drug-related problems. The advent of pharmaco-cybernetics has led to the development of various software, tools, and Internet applications that can be used by healthcare practitioners to deliver optimum pharmaceutical care and health-related outcomes. Patients are becoming more informed through health information on the Internet, which empowers them to better participate in the management of their own conditions. Focusing on patients with cancer, this chapter describes the use of a pharmaco-cybernetics approach to identify clinically relevant predictors of two debilitating adverse drug reactions, which are a cause of patient safety -chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting and febrile neutropenia. The early identification of such clinical predictors enables clinicians to prevent or reduce the occurrence of adverse drug reactions in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy through appropriate management strategies. The computational methods used in this approach involve two unsupervised machine-learning techniques -principal component and multiple correspondence analyses. Using two case examples, this chapter shows the potential of machine-learning techniques for identifying patients who are at greater risks of these adverse drug reactions, thus enhancing patient safety. This chapter also aims to increase the awareness among healthcare professionals and clinician-scientists about the usefulness of such techniques in clinical patient populations, so that these can be considered as part of clinical care pathways to enhance patient safety and effectively manage cancer patients on chemotherapy.",2017,,"Healthcare Ethics and Training: Concepts, Methodologies, Tools, and Applications",,,1291-1310,WOS:000472166200062,10.4018/978-1-5225-2237-9.ch061,,#5362,Yap 2017,Exclusion reason: Full Text Not Found; ,""
Novel adverse events of brexpiprazole: A disproportionality analysis in USA Food and Drug Administration adverse event reporting system database,"Subeesh, V.; Singh, H.; Maheswari, E.; Beulah, T.","BACKGROUND: Signal detection is an advanced technique in pharmacovigilance for the early detection of new, rare reactions (desired or undesired) of a drug which enables healthcare professionals to be vigilant in encountering serious adverse events associated with the drug. Brexpiprazole, the second approved D2 partial agonist was intended for the treatment of schizophrenia and as adjunctive therapy for major depressive disorder (MDD). The study aimed at detecting the novel adverse events associated with brexpiprazole by data mining analysis of the Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) database of Adverse Event Reporting System (AERS) using data mining algorithms. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was carried out in USFDA Adverse Event Reporting System database by applying the three most commonly used data mining algorithms, namely, Reporting Odds Ratio (ROR), Proportional Reporting Ratio (PRR) and Information Component (IC) from 2015 second quarter (Q2) to 2016 fourth quarter (Q4). A value of ROR-1.96SE>1, PRR≥2, IC- 2SD>0 were considered as the positive signal. RESULTS: The USFDA AERS database is comprised of 61,66,215 DECs totally which were reported from 2015 Q2 to 2016Q4. Among which, 3548 DECs were associated with brexpiprazole. On analysis, data mining algorithms exhibited positive signal for five novel reactions viz., agitation, anger, depression, dry mouth and insomnia as those were well above the pre-set threshold.

MTTLADE: A multi-task transfer learning-based method for adverse drug events extraction,"El-allaly, E. D.; Sarrouti, M.; En-Nahnahi, N.; El Alaoui, S. O.","Extracting mentions of Adverse Drug Events (ADEs) and the potential relationships among them from clinical textual data remains challenging tasks due to the following issues: (1) many ADEs mentions have multiple relations, also known as the multi-head issue, and (2) many ADEs relations contain discontinuous mentions. To deal with these problems, in this paper, we propose a Multi -Task Transfer Learning-based method for ADEs extraction, called MTTLADE. Firstly, the MTTLADE system converts the ADEs extraction task to a dual-task sequence labelling which includes ADEs source mention extraction (ADE-SE) and ADEs attribute-relation extraction (ADEAtt-RE) tasks. The ADE-SE task aims at extracting the source mentions that are likely related to at least one relation, while the ADE-Att-RE task consists in linking the previously identified source mentions to their target attributes and relation types by adopting a unified sequence labelling. Then, it uses the multi-task transfer learning (MTTL) based approach to process the two proposed tasks simultaneously. The MTTL adopts a shared representation obtained from the pre-trained language model learned through transformer architecture and ends up with task specific fine-tuning. This allows the MTTLADE system to yield more generalized representation across the tasks. Finally, MTTLADE produces sequences for each task from the generated model so as to extract ADEs mentions and relations. Experimental evaluations conducted on two datasets provided by the TAC 2017 and n2c2 2018 shared tasks show the effectiveness and generalizability of MTTLADE. The proposed MTTLADE system significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art ones on both datasets. The results also show that combining transfer and multitask learning makes MTTLADE more effective for solving the multi-head issue and extracting intricate ADEs.",2021,May,Information Processing & Management,58,3,17,WOS:000633034700010,10.1016/j.ipm.2020.102473,,#4751,El-allaly 2021,Exclusion reason: Full Text Not Found; ,""
MTMA: Multi-task multi-attribute learning for the prediction of adverse drug-drug interaction,"Zhu, J. J.; Liu, Y. G.; Wen, C. B.","Adverse drug-drug interaction (ADDI) is an important issue in drug developments and clinical applications, which causes a significant burden in the healthcare system and leads to serious morbidity and mortality in patients. Many methods are proposed for ADDI prediction due to the accumulation of healthcare data in a massive scale. However, these methods are insufficient in exploring the potential adverse mechanisms among drugs and incapable of revealing the leading factors of ADDIs. In this paper, we propose a Multi-Task Multi-Attribute (MTMA) learning model for ADDI prediction. In MTMA, two drug attributes, molecular structure and side effect, are adopted to model the adverse interactions among drugs and two interpretable tensors, adverse molecular structure-molecular structure interaction tensor and adverse side effect-side effect interaction tensor, are designed to uncover the adverse mechanisms among drugs. Meanwhile, we impose l(2,1)-norm on the predicted attribute matrices to explore the leading molecular substructures and side effects for each specific ADDI. The optimization problem of MTMA is solved by an alternating algorithm based on the methods of low-rank tensor decomposition and stochastic gradient descent. Experiments on the real-world dataset demonstrate the considerable performance of MTMA when compared with nine baseline methods and its three variants. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Stochastic goal programming approach to determine the side effects to be labeled on pharmaceutical drugs,"Rajendran, S.; Ansaripour, A.; Kris Srinivasan, M.; Chandra, M.

Recent years have witnessed an increase in drug-reaction-related lawsuits driving pharmaceutical companies to declare more side effects on the product label, which may negatively influence the product sales because patients or prescribing physicians may perceive the drug to be unsafe. Clearly, the objectives of minimizing lawsuit cost and potential customer loss are conflicting in nature, and therefore, it is necessary to determine the side effects to report on the label such that the best compromise is achieved between the two. A stochastic multiple criteria mathematical programming (SMCMP) model is developed to serve as a decision support system in assisting pharmaceutical companies with labeling decisions. A non-preemptive stochastic goal programming technique is used to solve the SMCMP model to attain a tradeoff solution between the two objectives. We verify the model with sample datasets and conduct sensitivity analysis by varying the lawsuit costs and number of customers lost.

Causality assessment of adverse drug reaction: Controlling confounding induced by polypharmacy,"Dang, T. T.; Nguyen, T. H.; Ho, T. B.","Background: Post-marketing pharmaceutical surveillance, a.k.a. pragmatic clinical trials (i.e., PCT), plays a vital role in preventing accidents in practical treatment. The most important and difficult task in PCT is to assess which drug causes adverse reactions (i.e., ADRs) from clinical texts. The confounding (i.e., factors cause confusions in causality assessment) is generated by the polypharmacy (i.e., multiple drugs use), which makes most of existing methods poor for detecting drugs that capably cause observed ADRs. Objective: We aim to improve the performance of detecting drug-ADR causal relations from clinical texts. To this end, a mechanism for reducing the impact of confounding on the detecting process is needful. Methods: We proposed a novel model which is called the analogy-based active voting (i.e., AAV) for improving the ability of detecting causal drug-ADR pairs, in case multiple drugs are prescribed for treating the comorbidity. This model is inspired by the analogy principle which was proposed by Bradford Hill. Results: The experimental results show the improvement of recognizing causal relations between drugs and ADRs that are confirmed by the SIDER. In addition, the proposed model is promising to detect infrequently observed causal drug-ADR pairs when the drug is not commonly used. Conclusion: The proposed model demonstrates its ability for controlling the polypharmacy-induced confounding, to improve the quality of causality assessment of ADRs.

Besides ADE, other semantic relation types (e.g., drug indication and beneficial effect) could hold between the drug and adverse event mentions, making ADE relation extraction - distinguishing ADE relationship from other relation types - necessary. However, conducting ADE relation extraction in social media environment is not a trivial task because of the expertise-dependent, time-consuming and costly annotation process, and the feature space's high-dimensionality attributed to intrinsic characteristics of social media data. This study aims to develop a framework for ADE relation extraction using patient-generated content in social media with better performance than that delivered by previous efforts. To achieve the objective, a general semi-supervised ensemble learning framework, SSEL-ADE, was developed. The framework exploited various lexical, semantic, and syntactic features, and integrated ensemble learning and semi-supervised learning. A series of experiments were conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed framework. Empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of each component of SSEL-ADE and reveal that our proposed framework outperforms most of existing ADE relation extraction methods The SSEL-ADE can facilitate enhanced ADE relation extraction performance, thereby providing more reliable support for pharmacovigilance. Moreover, the proposed semi-supervised ensemble methods have the potential of being applied to effectively deal with other social media-based problems.",2018,Jan,Artif Intell Med,84,,34-49,29111222,10.1016/j.artmed.2017.10.003,,#6837,Liu 2018,Exclusion reason: Full Text Not Found; ,""

Refining adverse drug reaction signals by incorporating interaction variables identified using emergent pattern mining,"Reps, J. M.; Aickelin, U.; Hubbard, R. B.","PURPOSE: To develop a framework for identifying and incorporating candidate confounding interaction terms into a regularised cox regression analysis to refine adverse drug reaction signals obtained via longitudinal observational data. METHODS: We considered six drug families that are commonly associated with myocardial infarction in observational healthcare data, but where the causal relationship ground truth is known (adverse drug reaction or not). We applied emergent pattern mining to find itemsets of drugs and medical events that are associated with the development of myocardial infarction. These are the candidate confounding interaction terms. We then implemented a cohort study design using regularised cox regression that incorporated and accounted for the candidate confounding interaction terms. RESULTS: The methodology was able to account for signals generated due to confounding and a cox regression with elastic net regularisation correctly ranking the drug families known to be true adverse drug reactions above those that are not. This was not the case without the inclusion of the candidate confounding interaction terms, where confounding leads to a non-adverse drug reaction being ranked highest. CONCLUSIONS: The methodology is efficient, can identify high-order confounding interactions and does not require expert input to specify outcome specific confounders, so it can be applied for any outcome of interest to quickly refine its signals. The proposed method shows excellent potential to overcome some forms of confounding and therefore reduce the false positive rate for signal analysis using longitudinal data.",2016,Feb 1,Comput Biol Med,69,,61-70,26722822,10.1016/j.compbiomed.2015.11.014,,#6319,Reps 2016,Exclusion reason: Full Text Not Found; ,""

METHODS: 406 consecutive HIV-infected adults attending a tertiary HIV clinic in semi-urban Nigeria were prospectively recruited between August and November 2014. These participants were stratified by antiretroviral treatment status. A propensity score matching model was fitted to examine the causal average treatment effects on the treated (ATT) of antiretroviral therapy on blood pressure. Propensity score matching entailed using nearest neighbour matching with a calliper width of 0.2 to achieve similarity in the baseline characteristics between participants naïve and exposed to antiretroviral therapy. RESULTS: Matching HIV-infected patients naïve and exposed to antiretroviral therapy on the propensity score yielded a total of 303 participants - 229 antiretroviral-exposed and 74 antiretroviral-naïve - matched without any residual differences in the baseline characteristics between both groups of patients.

DeepCADRME: A deep neural model for complex adverse drug reaction mentions extraction,"El-allaly, E. D.; Sarrouti, M.; En-Nahnahi, N.; El Alaoui, S. O.","Extracting mentions of Adverse Drug Reaction (ADR) from biomedical texts, aiming to support pharmacovigilance and drug safety surveillance, remains a challenging task as many ADR mentions are nested, discontinuous and overlapping. To solve these issues, in this paper, we propose a deep neural model for Complex Adverse Drug Reaction Mentions Extraction, called DeepCADRME. It first transforms the ADR mentions extraction problem as an N-level tagging sequence. Then, it feeds the sequences to an N level model based on contextual embeddings where the output of the pre-trained model of the current level is used to build a new deep contextualized representation for the next level. This allows the DeepCADRME system to transfer knowledge between levels. Experimental results performed on the TAC 2017 ADR dataset, show the effectiveness of DeepCADRME which leads to a new state-of-the-art performance by reaching a F1 of 85.35% and 85.41% with and without mention types, respectively.

Among the above parameters repetitive behavior plays a vital role for physician to prescribe dosage of drugs. The repetitive behavior and more aggressiveness in the autistic child is the symptom for growth of the disease. To control the repetitive behavior, the physician prescribe the dosage level of drug based on Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC). The ABC is measured only for few seconds by the physician and such measurement need continuous monitoring for proper prescription of drugs and also to avoid adverse drug effect. The above problem solve through IP Webcam app based ASD recognition for continuous monitoring and replaces the empirical method of ABC measurement.

"A comparison of renal-related adverse drug reactions between rofecoxib and celecoxib, based on the World Health Organization/Uppsala Monitoring Centre safety database","Zhao, S. Z.; Reynolds, M. W.; Lejkowith, J.; Whelton, A.; Arellano, F. M.","BACKGROUND: Two isoforms of cyclooxygenase (COX) have been identified, both of them inhibited by traditional nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Inhibition of COX-2 has been associated with the therapeutic effects of NSAIDs, whereas inhibition of COX-1 is believed to be the cause of the adverse gastrointestinal effects associated with NSAID therapy. When administered at therapeutic doses, new COX-2-specific inhibitors inhibit only the COX-2 isoform. OBJECTIVE: This study sought to compare renal safety signals between the COX-2-specific inhibitors rofecoxib and celecoxib, based on spontaneous reports of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) in the World Health Organization/Uppsala Monitoring Centre (WHO/UMC) safety database through the end of the second quarter 2000. METHODS: Disproportionality in the association between a particular drug and renal-related ADR was evaluated using a bayesian confidence propagation neural network method in which a statistical parameter, the information component (IC) value, was calculated for each drug-ADR combination. In this method, an IC value significantly greater than 0 implies that the association of a drug-ADR pair is stronger than background; the higher the IC value, the more the combination stands out from the background. The ratio of actual to expected numbers of ADRs was also used to assess disproportionality. RESULTS: As with traditional NSAIDs, both COX-2-specific inhibitors were associated with renal-related ADRs. However, the adverse renal impact of rofecoxib was significantly greater than that of celecoxib. IC values were significantly different for the following comparisons: water retention (1.97 rofecoxib vs 1.18 celecoxib; P < 0.01); abnormal renal function (2.38 vs 0.70; P < 0.01); renal failure (2.22 vs 1.09; P < 0.01); cardiac failure (2.39 vs 0.48; P < 0.01); and hypertension (2.15 vs 1.33; P < 0.01). In an additional analysis, celecoxib was shown to have a similar renal safety profile to that of diclofenac and ibuprofen. CONCLUSIONS: Based on spontaneous ADR reports in the WHO/UMC safety database at the end of the second quarter 2000, this analysis indicates that rofecoxib has significantly greater renal toxicity than celecoxib or traditional NSAIDs.

An automated pipeline for analyzing medication event reports in clinical settings,"Zhou, S.; Kang, H.; Yao, B.; Gong, Y.","BACKGROUND: Medication events in clinical settings are significant threats to patient safety. Analyzing and learning from the medication event reports is an important way to prevent the recurrence of these events. Currently, the analysis of medication event reports is ineffective and requires heavy workloads for clinicians. An automated pipeline is proposed to help clinicians deal with the accumulated reports, extract valuable information and generate feedback from the reports. Thus, the strategy of medication event prevention can be further developed based on the lessons learned. METHODS: In order to build the automated pipeline, four classic machine learning classifiers (i.e., support vector machine, Naïve Bayes, random forest, and multi-layer perceptron) were compared to identify the event originating stages, event types, and event causes from the medication event reports. The precision, recall and F-1 measure were calculated to assess the performance of the classifiers. Further, a strategy to measure the similarity of medication event reports in our pipeline was established and evaluated by human subjects through a questionnaire. RESULTS: We developed three classifiers to identify the medication event originating stages, event types and causes, respectively. For the event originating stages, a support vector machine classifier obtains the best performance with an F-1 measure of 0.792. For the event types, a support vector machine classifier exhibits the best performance with an F-1 measure of 0.758. And for the event causes, a random forest classifier reaches an F-1 measure of 0.925. The questionnaire results show that the similarity measurement is consistent with the domain experts in the task of identifying similar reports. CONCLUSION: We developed and evaluated an automated pipeline that could identify three attributes from the medication event reports and calculate the similarity scores between the reports based on the attributes.

A Machine Learning-Aided Framework to Predict Outcomes of Anti-PD-1 Therapy for Patients With Gynecological Cancer on Incomplete Post-Marketing Surveillance Dataset,X. Liu; Z. Xiao; Y. Song; R. Zhang; X. Li; Z. Du,"Post-marketing surveillance of antineoplastic agents is performed to evaluate the efficacy and safety in patients aiming at expanding drug indications and discovering potential adverse events. The real-world data is fraught with missing values. Literature addressing different strategies for dealing with missing data in such a situation is scarce. Using machine learning (ML) algorithms for predicting therapeutic outcomes of PD-1/PD-L1 Inhibitors has attracted attention. However, training a predictive model usually requires imaging or biomarker information, which is rarely available in the post-marketing surveillance data. To address these challenges, we propose an ML-aided framework to predict the outcomes of Anti-PD-1 therapy for gynecological malignancy on a dataset with 117 patient samples, treated by Camrelizumab (with 50 patient samples), Sintilimab (44), and Toripalimab (23). Four therapeutic outcomes, including Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST), organ adverse effect (AE), general AE, and death, are predicted. The proposed framework feeds the dataset into a learning pipeline consisting of imputation, feature engineering, model training, ensemble learning, and model selection to generate the final predictive model. We conduct experiments to justify several critical design choices, such as the specific feature engineering strategies and the SMOTE over-sampling technique. The final model for each learning task is selected from a large pool of model candidates based on a joint consideration of accuracy and F1. Moreover, we conduct thorough and visualized model analysis and gain a deeper understanding of model behavior and feature importance.

A new algorithmic approach for the extraction of temporal associations from clinical narratives with an application to medical product safety surveillance reports,"Wang, W.; Kreimeyer, K.; Woo, E. J.; Ball, R.; Foster, M.; Pandey, A.; Scott, J.; Botsis, T.","The sheer volume of textual information that needs to be reviewed and analyzed in many clinical settings requires the automated retrieval of key clinical and temporal information. The existing natural language processing systems are often challenged by the low quality of clinical texts and do not demonstrate the required performance. In this study, we focus on medical product safety report narratives and investigate the association of the clinical events with appropriate time information. We developed a novel algorithm for tagging and extracting temporal information from the narratives, and associating it with related events. The proposed algorithm minimizes the performance dependency on text quality by relying only on shallow syntactic information and primitive properties of the extracted event and time entities. We demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm by evaluating its tagging and time assignment capabilities on 140 randomly selected reports from the US Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) and the FDA (Food and Drug Administration) Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS).

We further evaluated the ability of our algorithm to correctly identify the time information for the events in the 2012 Informatics for Integrating Biology and the Bedside (i2b2) Challenge corpus.

Bayesian hierarchical model for safety signal detection in multiple clinical trials,"Zhang, Y.; Yuan, S. S.; Eagel, B. A.; Li, H.; Lin, L. A.; Wang, W. W. B.","Clinical safety signal detection is of great importance in establishing the safety profile of new drugs and biologics during drug development. Bayesian hierarchical meta-analysis has proven to be a very effective method of identifying potential safety signals by considering the hierarchical structure of clinical safety data from multiple randomized clinical trials conducted under an Investigational New Drug (IND) application or Biological License Application (BLA). This type of model can integrate information across studies, for instance by grouping related adverse events using the MedDRA system-organ-class (SOC) and preferred terms (PT). It therefore improves the precision of parameter estimates compared to models that do not consider the hierarchical structure of the safety data. We propose to extend an existing four-stage Bayesian hierarchical model and consider the exposure adjusted incidence rate, assuming the number of adverse events (AEs) follows a Poisson distribution. The proposed model is applied to a real-world example, using data from three randomized clinical trials of a neuroscience drug and examine in three simulation studies motivated by real-world examples. Comparison is made between the proposed method and other existing methods. The simulation results indicate that our proposed model outperforms other two candidate models in terms of power and false detection rate.",2020,,Contemporary Clinical Trials,99,,,,10.1016/j.cct.2020.106183,,#757,Zhang 2020,Exclusion reason: Lack of Pharmacovigilance/Drug Safety; ,""
Continued Statin Prescriptions After Adverse Reactions and Patient Outcomes: A Cohort Study,"Zhang, H.; Plutzky, J.; Shubina, M.; Turchin, A.","BACKGROUND: Many patients discontinue statin treatment, often after having a possible adverse reaction. The risks and benefits of continued statin therapy after an adverse reaction are not known. OBJECTIVE: To examine the relationship between continuation of statin therapy (any prescription within 12 months after an adverse reaction) and clinical outcomes. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Primary care practices affiliated with 2 academic medical centers. PARTICIPANTS: Patients with a presumed adverse reaction to a statin between 2000 and 2011. MEASUREMENTS: Information on adverse reactions to statins was obtained from structured electronic medical record data or natural-language processing of narrative provider notes. The primary composite outcome was time to a cardiovascular event (myocardial infarction or stroke) or death. RESULTS: Most (81%) of the adverse reactions to statins were identified from the text of electronic provider notes. Among 28 266 study patients, 19 989 (70.7%) continued receiving statin prescriptions after the adverse reaction. Four years after the presumed adverse event, the cumulative incidence of the composite primary outcome was 12.2% for patients with continued statin prescriptions, compared with 13.9% for those without them (difference, 1.7% [95% CI, 0.8% to 2.7%]; P < 0.001). In a secondary analysis of 7604 patients for whom a different statin was prescribed after the adverse reaction, 2014 (26.5%) had a documented adverse reaction to the second statin, but 1696 (84.2%) of those patients continued receiving statin prescriptions. LIMITATIONS: The risk for recurrent adverse reactions to statins could not be established for the entire sample. It was also not possible to determine whether patients actually took the statins.

We assessed the performance of deep neural network models in classifying the Advanced Incident Reporting System reports and compared the models' performance with that of other common classification methods (including logistic regression, support vector machines and the decision-tree method). We also evaluated the effects on prediction outcomes of several deep neural network model settings, including number of layers, number of neurons and activation regularisation functions. The accuracy of the models was measured at 0.9 or above across model settings and algorithms. The average values obtained for accuracy and area under the curve were 0.940 (standard deviation: 0.011) and 0.911 (standard deviation: 0.019), respectively.

"Active computerized pharmacovigilance using natural language processing, statistics, and electronic health records: a feasibility study","Wang, X.; Hripcsak, G.; Markatou, M.; Friedman, C.","OBJECTIVE It is vital to detect the full safety profile of a drug throughout its market life. Current pharmacovigilance systems still have substantial limitations, however. The objective of our work is to demonstrate the feasibility of using natural language processing (NLP), the comprehensive Electronic Health Record (EHR), and association statistics for pharmacovigilance purposes. DESIGN Narrative discharge summaries were collected from the Clinical Information System at New York Presbyterian Hospital (NYPH). MedLEE, an NLP system, was applied to the collection to identify medication events and entities which could be potential adverse drug events (ADEs). Co-occurrence statistics with adjusted volume tests were used to detect associations between the two types of entities, to calculate the strengths of the associations, and to determine their cutoff thresholds. Seven drugs/drug classes (ibuprofen, morphine, warfarin, bupropion, paroxetine, rosiglitazone, ACE inhibitors) with known ADEs were selected to evaluate the system. RESULTS One hundred thirty-two potential ADEs were found to be associated with the 7 drugs. Overall recall and precision were 0.75 and 0.31 for known ADEs respectively. Importantly, qualitative evaluation using historic roll back design suggested that novel ADEs could be detected using our system. CONCLUSIONS This study provides a framework for the development of active, high-throughput and prospective systems which could potentially unveil drug safety profiles throughout their entire market life.

Association rule mining in the US Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS),"Wei, L.; Scott, J.","PURPOSE: Spontaneous adverse event reporting systems are critical tools for monitoring the safety of licensed medical products. Commonly used signal detection algorithms identify disproportionate product-adverse event pairs and may not be sensitive to more complex potential signals. We sought to develop a computationally tractable multivariate data-mining approach to identify product-multiple adverse event associations. METHODS: We describe an application of stepwise association rule mining (Step-ARM) to detect potential vaccine-symptom group associations in the US Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System. Step-ARM identifies strong associations between one vaccine and one or more adverse events. To reduce the number of redundant association rules found by Step-ARM, we also propose a clustering method for the post-processing of association rules. RESULTS: In sample applications to a trivalent intradermal inactivated influenza virus vaccine and to measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella (MMRV) vaccine and in simulation studies, we find that Step-ARM can detect a variety of medically coherent potential vaccine-symptom group signals efficiently. In the MMRV example, Step-ARM appears to outperform univariate methods in detecting a known safety signal. CONCLUSIONS: Our approach is sensitive to potentially complex signals, which may be particularly important when monitoring novel medical countermeasure products such as pandemic influenza vaccines. The post-processing clustering algorithm improves the applicability of the approach as a screening method to identify patterns that may merit further investigation.",2015,Sep,Pharmacoepidemiol Drug Saf,24,9,922-933,26045284,10.1002/pds.3797,,#633,Wei 2015,Exclusion reason: Lack of Machine Learning; ,""
Annotation and detection of drug effects in text for pharmacovigilance,"Thompson, P.; Daikou, S.; Ueno, K.; Batista-Navarro, R.; Tsujii, J.; Ananiadou, S.","Pharmacovigilance (PV) databases record the benefits and risks of different drugs, as a means to ensure their safe and effective use. Creating and maintaining such resources can be complex, since a particular medication may have divergent effects in different individuals, due to specific patient characteristics and/or interactions with other drugs being administered. Textual information from various sources can provide important evidence to curators of PV databases about the usage and effects of drug targets in different medical subjects. However, the efficient identification of relevant evidence can be challenging, due to the increasing volume of textual data. Text mining (TM) techniques can support curators by automatically detecting complex information, such as interactions between drugs, diseases and adverse effects. This semantic information supports the quick identification of documents containing information of interest (e.g., the different types of patients in which a given adverse drug reaction has been observed to occur). TM tools are typically adapted to different domains by applying machine learning methods to corpora that are manually labelled by domain experts using annotation guidelines to ensure consistency. We present a semantically annotated corpus of 597 MEDLINE abstracts, PHAEDRA, encoding rich information on drug effects and their interactions, whose quality is assured through the use of detailed annotation guidelines and the demonstration of high levels of inter-annotator agreement (e.g., 92.6% F-Score for identifying named entities and 78.4% F-Score for identifying complex events, when relaxed matching criteria are applied). To our knowledge, the corpus is unique in the domain of PV, according to the level of detail of its annotations.

Detecting adverse drug reactions in discharge summaries of electronic medical records using Readpeer,"Tang, Y.; Yang, J.; Ang, P. S.; Dorajoo, S. R.; Foo, B.; Soh, S.; Tan, S. H.; Tham, M. Y.; Ye, Q.; Shek, L.; Sung, C.; Tung, A.","BACKGROUND: Hospital discharge summaries offer a potentially rich resource to enhance pharmacovigilance efforts to evaluate drug safety in real-world clinical practice. However, it is infeasible for experts to read through all discharge summaries to find cases of drug-adverse event (AE) relations. PURPOSE: The objective of this paper is to develop a natural language processing (NLP) framework to detect drug-AE relations from unstructured hospital discharge summaries. BASIC PROCEDURES: An NLP algorithm was designed using customized dictionaries of drugs, adverse event (AE) terms, and rules based on trigger phrases, negations, fuzzy logic and word distances to recognize drug, AE terms and to detect drug-AE relations. Furthermore, a customized annotation tool was developed to facilitate expert review of discharge summaries from a tertiary hospital in Singapore in 2011. MAIN FINDINGS: A total of 33 trial sets with 50 to 100 records per set were evaluated (1620 discharge summaries) by our algorithm and reviewed by pharmacovigilance experts. After every 6 trial sets, drug and AE dictionaries were updated, and rules were modified to improve the system. Excellent performance was achieved for drug and AE entity recognition with over 92% precision and recall. On the final 6 sets of discharge summaries (600 records), our algorithm achieved 75% precision and 59% recall for identification of valid drug-AE relations. PRINCIPAL CONCLUSIONS: Adverse drug reactions are a significant contributor to health care costs and utilization. Our algorithm is not restricted to particular drugs, drug classes or specific medical specialties, which is an important attribute for a national regulatory authority to carry out comprehensive safety monitoring of drug products. Drug and AE dictionaries may be updated periodically to ensure that the tool remains relevant for performing surveillance activities.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We organized 3 independent subtasks: automatic classification of self-reports of 1) adverse drug reactions (ADRs) and 2) medication consumption, from medication-mentioning tweets, and 3) normalization of ADR expressions. Training data consisted of 15 717 annotated tweets for (1), 10 260 for (2), and 6650 ADR phrases and identifiers for (3); and exhibited typical properties of social-media-based health-related texts.

Extracting drug-drug interactions from literature using a rich feature-based linear kernel approach,"Kim, S.; Liu, H.; Yeganova, L.; Wilbur, W.

Despite existence of several resources for drug-drug interaction (DDI) information, the wealth of such information is buried in a body of unstructured medical text which is growing exponentially. This calls for developing text mining techniques for identifying DDIs. The state-of-the-art DDI extraction methods use Support Vector Machines (SVMs) with non-linear composite kernels to explore diverse contexts in literature. While computationally less expensive, linear kernel-based systems have not achieved a comparable performance in DDI extraction tasks. In this work, we propose an efficient and scalable system using a linear kernel to identify DDI information. The proposed approach consists of two steps: identifying DDIs and assigning one of four different DDI types to the predicted drug pairs. We demonstrate that when equipped with a rich set of lexical and syntactic features, a linear SVM classifier is able to achieve a competitive performance in detecting DDIs. In addition, the one-against-one strategy proves vital for addressing an imbalance issue in DDI type classification.

The pharmacological relevance of drug-event associations is not considered in SDR prioritisation algorithms. This aimed to propose and test a pharmacological score for SDR prioritisation. Methods: The Pharmacological Score for SDRs Prioritisation (PS-SP) was developed using a Delphi approach. An expert group agreed that PS-SP should include general criteria concerning SDRs and criteria concerning pharmacological relevance, and that criteria should be weighted for their risk representation. Once defined, the PS-SP was tested for prioritisation of SDRs for extrapyramidal syndrome in the French Pharmacovigilance database; the SDR classification was compared to that obtained using a traditional disproportionality approach. Results: For a given drug, the general criteria retained were the reporting rate of the adverse drug reaction (ADR) and value of the 95% confidence interval (CI) lower boundary of the Reporting Odds Ratio (ROR). Pharmacological criteria consisted of the ADR reporting rate without concomitant at-risk drugs or those indicated for ADR treatment, and the value of the ROR 95% CI lower boundary as estimated in the subset of reports concerning drugs from the same therapeutic and then pharmacological class. Compared with traditional disproportionality, PS-SP prioritised specific drugs within congeners: metoclopramide, indoramin, and trimetazidine appeared as outliers within their classes; conventional antipsychotics had higher prioritisation than atypical antipsychotics.

"Clozapine-induced myocarditis: Electronic health register analysis of incidence, timing, clinical markers and diagnostic accuracy","Segev, A.; Iqbal, E.; McDonagh, T. A.; Casetta, C.; Oloyede, E.; Piper, S.; Plymen, C. M.; MacCabe, J. H.","Background Clozapine is associated with increased risk of myocarditis. However, many common side-effects of clozapine overlap with the clinical manifestations of myocarditis. As a result, there is uncertainty about which signs, symptoms and investigations are important in distinguishing myocarditis from benign adverse effects of clozapine. Clarity on this issue is important, since missing a diagnosis of myocarditis or discontinuing clozapine unnecessarily may both have devastating consequences. Aims To examine the clinical characteristics of clozapine-induced myocarditis and to identify which signs and symptoms distinguish true myocarditis from other clozapine adverse effects. Method A retrospective analysis of the record database for 247 621 patients was performed. A natural language processing algorithm identified the instances of patients in which myocarditis was suspected. The anonymised case notes for the patients of each suspected instance were then manually examined, and those whose instances were ambiguous were referred for an independent assessment by up to three cardiologists. Patients with suspected instances were classified as having confirmed myocarditis, myocarditis ruled out or undetermined. Results Of 254 instances in 228 patients with suspected myocarditis, 11.4% (n = 29 instances) were confirmed as probable myocarditis. Troponin and C-reactive protein (CRP) had excellent diagnostic value (area under the curve 0.975 and 0.896, respectively), whereas tachycardia was of little diagnostic value. All confirmed instances occurred within 42 days of clozapine initiation. Conclusions Suspicion of myocarditis can lead to unnecessary discontinuation of clozapine. The 'critical period' for myocarditis emergence is the first 6 weeks, and clinical signs including tachycardia are of low specificity. Elevated CRP and troponin are the best markers for the need for further evaluation.",2021,,British Journal of Psychiatry,,,,,10.1192/bjp.2021.58,,#1184,Segev 2021,Exclusion reason: Lack of Machine Learning; ,""

Identifying adverse drug reaction entities from social media with adversarial transfer learning model,"Zhang, T.; Lin, H.; Ren, Y.; Yang, Z.; Wang, J.; Duan, X.; Xu, B.","Identifying adverse drug reaction (ADR) entities from texts is a crucial task for pharmacology, and it is the basis for the ADR relation extraction task. The publicly available resources on this task include PubMed abstracts, social media, and other resources. Among these resources, social media data can reflect the reactions of drug users after taking medicine in real-time and update quickly. However, a very small quantity of annotated social media data leads to less research on these data. Moreover, social media data have colloquialism and informal vocabulary expression problems, which pose a major challenge for ADR named entity recognition (NER). In this work, we present an adversarial transfer learning architecture for the ADR NER task. Our model improves the performance on Twitter data (target resource) by incorporating biomedical domain information from PubMed (source resource). Additionally, we set the scale parameter in the final loss function to address the problem of bias in model training caused by imbalanced amounts of data.

An ensembled SVM based approach for predicting adverse drug reactions,"Joshi, P.; Vedhanayagam, M.; Ramesh, R.","Background: Preventing adverse drug reactions (ADRs) is imperative for the safety of the people. The problem of under-reporting the ADRs has been prevalent across the world, making it difficult to develop the prediction models, which are unbiased. As a result, most of the models are skewed to the negative samples leading to high accuracy but poor performance in other metrics such as precision, recall, F1 score, and AUROC score. Objective: In this work, we have proposed a novel way of predicting the ADRs by balancing the dataset. Methods: The whole data set has been partitioned into balanced smaller data sets. SVMs with optimal kernel have been learned using each of the balanced data sets and the prediction of given ADR for the given drug has been obtained by voting from the ensembled optimal SVMs learned. Results: We have found that results are encouraging and comparable with the competing methods in the literature and obtained the average sensitivity of 0.97 for all the ADRs. The model has been interpreted and explained with SHAP values by various plots.

An ensemble method for extracting adverse drug events from social media,"Liu, J.; Zhao, S.; Zhang, X.","OBJECTIVE: Because adverse drug events (ADEs) are a serious health problem and a leading cause of death, it is of vital importance to identify them correctly and in a timely manner. With the development of Web 2.0, social media has become a large data source for information on ADEs. The objective of this study is to develop a relation extraction system that uses natural language processing techniques to effectively distinguish between ADEs and non-ADEs in informal text on social media. METHODS AND MATERIALS: We develop a feature-based approach that utilizes various lexical, syntactic, and semantic features. Information-gain-based feature selection is performed to address high-dimensional features. Then, we evaluate the effectiveness of four well-known kernel-based approaches (i.e., subset tree kernel, tree kernel, shortest dependency path kernel, and all-paths graph kernel) and several ensembles that are generated by adopting different combination methods (i.e., majority voting, weighted averaging, and stacked generalization). All of the approaches are tested using three data sets: two health-related discussion forums and one general social networking site (i.e., Twitter). RESULTS: When investigating the contribution of each feature subset, the feature-based approach attains the best area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) values, which are 78.6%, 72.2%, and 79.2% on the three data sets. When individual methods are used, we attain the best AUC values of 82.1%, 73.2%, and 77.0% using the subset tree kernel, shortest dependency path kernel, and feature-based approach on the three data sets, respectively. When using classifier ensembles, we achieve the best AUC values of 84.5%, 77.3%, and 84.5% on the three data sets, outperforming the baselines. CONCLUSIONS: Our experimental results indicate that ADE extraction from social media can benefit from feature selection. With respect to the effectiveness of different feature subsets, lexical features and semantic features can enhance the ADE extraction capability. Kernel-based approaches, which can stay away from the feature sparsity issue, are qualified to address the ADE extraction problem. Combining different individual classifiers using suitable combination methods can further enhance the ADE extraction effectiveness.",2016,Jun,Artif Intell Med,70,,62-76,27431037,10.1016/j.artmed.2016.05.004,,#2751,Liu 2016,Exclusion reason: Full Text Not Found; ,""

Conventional hypothesis testing of between group differences for each adverse event can be problematic: Lack of significance does not mean lack of risk, the tests usually are not adjusted for multiplicity, and the data determine which hypotheses are tested. This article describes a Bayesian screening approach that does not test hypotheses, is self-adjusting for multiplicity, provides a direct assessment of the likelihood of no material drug-event association, and quantifies the strength of the observed association. The criteria for assessing drug-event associations can be determined by clinical or regulatory considerations.

Most existing computer-aided methods for predicting ADRs mainly rely on known drug-ADR associations and achieve expected performances on overall data sets. However, they fail to predict ADRs for less-characterized drugs because of insufficient prior knowledge. To solve this problem, we present a novel method with new drug features.

Then, similarities between drugs were calculated in different ways based on drug-target interactions. Finally, comprehensive validations were carried out to compare the new approach with four other typical approaches on various drug features. Comparison of approaches and features showed that no matter evaluated by tenfold cross-validation or prospective validation, IMC consistently performed well on both types of drugs, well-known or less studied.

We then evaluated the models on a larger data set of previously unseen reports. RESULTS: The best-performing models achieved recall and F1 scores on both data sets above 0.80 for the identification of assessable reports (i.e. those containing enough information to make an informed causality assessment) and above 0.75 for the identification of reports meeting at least a Possible causality threshold. CONCLUSIONS: Causal inference from FAERS reports depends on many components with complex logical relationships that are yet to be made fully computable. Efforts focused on readily addressable tasks, such as quickly eliminating unassessable reports, fit naturally in SE's thought processes to provide real enhancements for FDA workflows.",2021,Aug,Comput Biol Med,135,,104517,34130003,10.1016/j.compbiomed.2021.104517,,#3042,Kreimeyer 2021,Exclusion reason: Full Text Not Found; ,""
Big data mining and analysis of security alert signals of olanzapine,"Zhu, X. Q.; Hu, J. Q.; Deng, S. H.; Tan, Y. Q.; Wang, Z. Z.; Lu, H. Y.; Ni, X. J.; Li, L.; Zhang, M.; Shang, D. W.; Wen, Y. G.","Objective: To analyze the security alert signals of olanzapine after marketing by big data mining, and to provide references for rational clinical drug use. Methods: The adverse drug events (ADE) of olanzapine since Jan, 2014 were retrieved based on the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database utilizing the Open Public Data project of FDA (openFDA). The signals were detected by reporting odds ratio (ROR), and the lower bound of 95% confidence interval (ROR 95% CILower bound) >1 was regarded as the suggestion of security alert signals. The disproportionality analysis results of alert signals for olanzapine vs. other antipsychotic drugs (including quetiapine, clozapine, risperidone, perphenazine, aripiprazole, ziprasidone, chlorpromazine, perphenazine, and haloperidol) were compared, and the highest relative reporting ratio (RRR) indicated the drug were the most probably related with the alert signal. Results: A total of 11 171 211 reports were retrieved, among which there were 27 705 ADE reports that were suspected to be caused by olanzapine. The number of reports and signals referring to psychiatric disorders were the highest. The ADE signals that were above 1 000 cases included toxicity to various agents, drug ineffective, drug interaction, weight increased, somnolence, completed suicide, overdose, and neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS). Among the top 100 ADE signals, a total of 83 security alert signals were detected by ROR, among which sixteen alert signals were not mentioned in the latest label of olanzapine, and the NMS showed the highest risk (ROR 95% CILower bound=58.227). The risk relevance of chlorpromazine (RRR=75.271) and haloperidol (RRR=66.164) in the case of NMS were both greater than that of olanzapine (RRR=52.375). Conclusion: It can effectively provide reference for future pharmacovigilance work to detect and analyze the security alert signals of olanzapine using openFDA platform.",2021,,Chinese Journal of New Drugs,30,1,87-93,,,,#814,Zhu 2021,Exclusion reason: Full Text Not Found; ,""
Towards Human-Machine Collaboration in Creating an Evaluation Corpus for Adverse Drug Events in Discharge Summaries of Electronic Medical Records,"Ang, P. S.; Fan, L. Y. P.; Tham, M. Y.; Tan, S. H.; Soh, S. B. L.; Foo, B. P. Q.; Loke, C. W. P.; Hu, S. F.; Sung, C.","Adverse drug events (ADEs) contribute significantly to morbidity and mortality in the healthcare system. The availability of digitalised hospitals' narrative clinical data offers a potentially rich resource to enhance pharmacovigilance efforts to manage potential safety issues arising from real-world use of drugs. The goal of this paper was to establish a foundation for creating an evaluation corpus by developing a set of annotation guidelines to achieve high inter-annotator agreement (IAA) and to evaluate the performance of basic entity identification tools for drugs, adverse events (AEs) and drug-AE relationships from 100 discharge summaries of a tertiary hospital in Singapore. Two teams of three annotators worked independently on text annotation using Knowtator. Three-way IAA of 86%, 70% and 49% were achieved for drugs, AEs and drug-AE relationships respectively. The performance of the machine algorithm was evaluated against annotations made by at least two annotators, with a recall of 84% and precision of 73% for drugs and a recall of 67% and precision of 53% for AEs. The high recall and precision for drug entity extraction suggests that machine pre-annotation of drugs followed by human annotation of AEs and drug-AE relationships could be a feasible approach in expediting the process of creating a larger evaluation corpus. Non-matches between machine and human annotations were examined to identify ways to further refine the algorithm. When successfully implemented, the identification of ADEs could greatly support pharmacovigilance work in characterising the magnitude and scope of ADEs and prioritising interventions to improve the drug safety.

Data mining and statistically guided clinical review of adverse event data in clinical trials,"Southworth, H.; O'Connell, M.","Some approaches to the analysis of adverse event data arising from clinical trials are presented. These include (a) an inside-out data mining method where the adverse events are used as explanatory variables, classifying the treatment allocation, (b) a support method where we fit separate regression models to each adverse event with and without a treatment effect, and (c) a three-level hierarchical Bayesian mixture model for analysis of adverse event counts. The problem of understanding treatment-emergence of the adverse events is formulated as one of data mining rather than hypothesis testing. Our approaches provide an ordering of the adverse events by the strength of evidence of a treatment effect, rather than p values for prespecified hypotheses. The three methods produce intuitive graphical summaries showing the treatment effect on adverse event incidence. These graphs can be readily linked to relevant supportive information such as reports summarizing predicted risks for (demographic) subpopulations of interest and patient-level data such as laboratory information, concomitant medications, and medical history. This results in a statistically guided and thorough review of drug safety in the clinical trial.",2009,,Journal of Biopharmaceutical Statistics,19,5,803-817,,10.1080/10543400903105232,,#1856,Southworth 2009,Exclusion reason: Full Text Not Found; ,""
Novel adverse events of vortioxetine: A disproportionality analysis in USFDA adverse event reporting system database,"Subeesh, V.; Singh, H.; Maheswari, E.; Beulah, E.","Background Signal detection is one of the most advanced and emerging field in pharmacovigilance. It is a modern method of detecting new reaction (which can be desired or undesired) of a drug. It facilitates early adverse drug reaction detection which enables health professionals to identify adverse events that may not have been identified in pre-marketing clinical trials. Vortioxetine, the first mixed serotonergic antidepressant was initially approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) on September 30, 2013 for the treatment of adults with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). This study was to identify the signal strength for vortioxetine associated ADRs using data mining technique in USFDA Adverse Event Reporting System (AERS) database. Methodology Most commonly used three data mining algorithms, Reporting Odds Ratio (ROR), Proportional Reporting Ratio (PRR) and Information Component (IC) were selected for the study and they were applied retrospectively in USFDA AERS database from 2015Q1 to 2016Q3. A value of ROR-1.96SE > 1, PRR ≥ 2, IC- 2SD > 0 were considered as the positive signal. Result A study population of 61,22,000 were reported all over the world. Among which 3481 reactions were associated with vortioxetine which comprised of 632 unique events encompassed with 27 clinically relevant reactions. ROR, PRR and IC showed positive signal for weight loss, agitation, anger, ketoacidosis, insomnia and abnormal dreams. Conclusion The present study suggests that vortioxetine may result in these adverse events. Further pharmacoepidemiologic studies are necessary to confirm this conclusion and to improve the precision of the prevalence and/or the risk factors of this ADRs.",2017,,Asian Journal of Psychiatry,30,,152-156,,10.1016/j.ajp.2017.09.005,,#5045,Subeesh 2017,Exclusion reason: Full Text Not Found; ,""
Pharmacovigilance and protective medication for drug-induced liver injury in treatment of COVID-19,"Li, X. J. Y.; Li, Y. J.; Ge, J. D.; Wu, K.

"Patterns of adverse drug reaction signals in NAFDAC Pharmacovigilance activities from September to November, 2014","Awodele, O.; Ibrahim, A.; Orhii, P.","BACKGROUND:Adverse drug reaction signals are reported information on possible causal relationships between an adverse event and a drug. The National Pharmacovigilance Centre (NPC) in Nigeria has over 3,000 reported adverse drug reaction cases which have been adequately entered into the ADR data bank. OBJECTIVE: Data mining of ADR reports from September to November, 2014 were carried out in this present study with the intention to describe the pattern of ADRs and generate possible signals. METHODS: A total of about 100 reported cases with arrays of adverse drug reactions were reported between September and November, 2014 and the data were analyzed using SPSS version 17. RESULTS: Efavirenz/Tenofovir/Lamivudine combination was the highest reported drugs (24.2%) while efavirenz alone was reported in 8 times (8.8%) and HIV (63.3%) was the highest reported indication of drug use. Efavirenz caused central nervous system adverse reactions as revealed in the ADRs analyses. Zidovudine/Lamivudine/Nevirapine combination in concomitant use with Cotrimoxazole were reported 8 times with generalized maculopapular rashes on the trunk with some area of hyper pigmentation with intense itching documented twice and big/swollen rashes all over the faces. Zidovudine was also reported four times to cause severe anaemia.

"Statin-associated lower urinary tract symptoms: Data mining of the public version of the FDA adverse event reporting system, FAERS","Fujimoto, M.; Hosomi, K.; Takada, M.","Objective: To examine the association between statin use and the risk of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) in reports submitted to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) between 2004 and 2011. Methods: Relevant reports in the FAERS were identified and analyzed. The reporting odds ratio (ROR) was used to detect spontaneous report signals, calculated using the case/non-case method. Cases were identified by the presence of reports of an adverse drug reaction (ADR) in which statins were the suspected drug. Non-cases were all the reports of the same reactions induced by drugs other than statins. The reporting odds ratio (ROR) and 95% confidential interval (CI) was calculated as a measure of disproportionality. Results: A total of 44,959,104 drug-reaction pairs was found in 2,681,739 reports. Significant RORs were found for both voiding (ROR; 1.16, 95% CI; 1.10-1.23) and storage symptoms (ROR; 1.25, 95% CI; 1.20-1.30). Analysis of individual statins showed that rosuvastatin, atorvastatin, and lovastatin had significant disproportionality for voiding symptoms, while simvastatin, rosuvastatin, pravastatin, atorvastatin, pitavastatin, and lovastatin had significant disproportionality for storage symptoms. Of the four voiding symptoms, significant RORs were found for urine flow decrease and dysuria. Of the four storage symptoms, significant RORs were found for pollakiuria and nocturia. No fundamental differences in disproportionality were observed between genders. Conclusions: Analysis of the FAERS database showed small but reliable signals for LUTS in statin users. The mechanism responsible for these reactions is unknown. However, these adverse events should be monitored closely. ©2014 Dustri-Verlag Dr. K.
